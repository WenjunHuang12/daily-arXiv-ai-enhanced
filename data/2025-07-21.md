Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

*Le-Anh Tran,Chung Nguyen Tran,Ngoc-Luu Nguyen,Nhan Cach Dang,Jordi Carrabina,David Castells-Rufas,Minh Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为EDNIG的新型深度学习框架，用于低光图像增强。该框架基于U-Net架构，结合了亮度图和多尺度特征提取模块，并通过GAN框架优化，取得了与现有方法相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强在现实应用中具有重要意义，但现有方法在处理多样光照条件时表现不足。EDNIG旨在通过引入亮度引导和多尺度特征提取，提升模型性能。

Method: EDNIG基于U-Net架构，结合亮度图（来自BCP）作为引导输入，并加入SPP模块提取多尺度特征。使用Swish激活函数和GAN框架优化，损失函数包括对抗损失、MSE和感知损失。

Result: 实验表明，EDNIG在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法，同时模型复杂度更低，适合实际应用。

Conclusion: EDNIG通过亮度引导和多尺度特征提取，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能，且具有较低的模型复杂度，适合实际部署。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

### [3] [HeCoFuse: Cross-Modal Complementary V2X Cooperative Perception with Heterogeneous Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13677)
*Chuheng Wei,Ziye Qin,Walter Zimmer,Guoyuan Wu,Matthew J. Barth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeCoFuse是一个统一的框架，用于解决V2X协同感知中异构传感器配置带来的挑战，通过分层融合机制和自适应学习策略，显著提升了感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统常因异构传感器配置导致特征融合和感知可靠性问题，需要一种统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，结合动态融合类型调整策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前V2X协同感知的先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

### [4] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在非局部视觉推理任务中的表现，发现即使表现优秀的模型也无法完成人类轻松完成的任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs在复杂视觉任务中表现出色，但它们在简单感知测试中表现不佳，尤其是需要非局部视觉推理的任务。

Method: 设计了三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索和平滑视觉搜索），并测试了主流模型在这些任务中的表现。

Result: 即使表现优秀的模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Vision 3.7、GPT-o4-mini）在这些任务中表现不佳，准确率仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 当前模型虽然在原始视觉敏锐度上有进步，但仍缺乏核心视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

### [5] [Enhancing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13362)
*Binbin Ji,Siddharth Agrawal,Qiance Tang,Yvonne Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习改进性能。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而强化学习方法（GRPO）在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于监督微调（SFT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并解决传统方法（如SFT）在泛化性上的不足。

Method: 使用SceneGraph CoT提示策略和Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）强化学习方法，在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估性能。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估中优于SFT，且在分布外（OOD）条件下表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习能有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化性，GRPO在鲁棒性上优于SFT。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

### [6] [TimeNeRF: Building Generalizable Neural Radiance Fields across Time from Few-Shot Input Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13929)
*Hsiang-Hui Hung,Huu-Phu Do,Yung-Hui Li,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间渲染新视图，即使输入视图较少。它结合多视角立体视觉、神经辐射场和解缠策略，实现少样本泛化能力，并能构建任意时间的神经辐射场。实验表明，TimeNeRF无需逐场景优化即可生成平滑过渡的时间动态视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多视图采集成本高且效率低，而元宇宙等数字领域对昼夜自然过渡的3D场景建模需求迫切。现有NeRF技术虽能合成新视图，但对时间动态3D场景建模的探索有限。

Method: 结合多视角立体视觉、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场，支持少样本泛化，并能在任意时间生成神经辐射场。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，尤其擅长生成平滑过渡的时间动态视图，捕捉从黎明到黄昏的自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF为时间动态3D场景建模提供了高效解决方案，适用于元宇宙等需要自然时间过渡的应用场景。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用2D视觉语言模型进行开放词汇3D物体检测，无需人工标注3D标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D物体检测数据集类别有限和标注成本高的问题，利用2D基础模型的丰富语义理解能力。

Method: 通过2D视觉语言检测器生成文本条件提案，结合SAM分割和相机几何投影到3D，引入基于DBSCAN和旋转卡尺的几何膨胀策略。

Result: 在LiDAR和RGB-D输入下实现竞争性定位性能，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Result: 在12种模态的25个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构、预训练策略和多任务训练方法在多模态场景中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

TL;DR: ModaRoute是一个基于LLM的多模态视频检索路由系统，通过动态选择最优模态，减少计算开销41%，同时保持60.9%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集文本标注方法计算成本高且遗漏关键视觉信息，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图，动态路由至ASR、OCR或视觉索引，平均每查询使用1.78种模态。

Result: 在180万视频片段上验证，减少基础设施成本的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 智能路由为多模态检索系统提供了可扩展的实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构（如YOLO和DETR）在多尺度特征一致性和检测精度与计算效率的平衡上存在不足，Butter旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Butter引入FAFCE组件和PHFFNet模块，分别通过自适应频率滤波和渐进式特征融合优化特征表示。

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上，Butter表现出卓越的特征表示能力，检测精度显著提升。

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化与融合，在实时自动驾驶场景中实现了精度、可部署性和计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving
community.

Result: 开放集检测方法显示出更高的潜力，减少了对大量缺陷标注的依赖，并能识别新型异常。

Conclusion: 论文提供了工业缺陷检测领域的全面视角，指出了未来发展趋势和实际应用中的挑战。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在卫星图像机器学习（SatML）中融合其他地理数据层对模型性能的影响，发现多模态输入能显著提升性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域测试时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SatML模型主要针对光学输入设计，但其他地理数据层的价值未被充分探索。

Method: 通过将额外地理数据层附加到SatML基准任务中，生成增强数据集，评估多模态输入的效果。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域测试时；硬编码融合策略优于学习策略。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML的数据效率和跨区域性能具有重要价值，未来研究可关注融合策略优化。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用低成本二进制占用数据增强3D语义占用预测的新框架，通过分解预测过程为二进制和语义模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义占用预测需要昂贵的LiDAR标注数据，而低成本的大规模二进制占用数据潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出了一种基于二进制占用的框架，将预测过程分解为二进制和语义占用模块，利用二进制数据进行预训练和学习自动标注。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在预训练和自动标注任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了3D语义占用预测性能，为低成本数据利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型InSyn，通过显式捕捉多样化的交互模式（如同步行走或冲突行为）来提升行人轨迹预测的准确性，并引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人轨迹预测在智能应用中至关重要，但现有方法主要依赖相对位置建模交互，忽略了特定交互模式（如配对行走或冲突行为），限制了预测准确性。

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略解决时间序列预测中的初始步发散问题。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上，InSyn显著优于现有基线模型，特别是在高密度场景中；SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低了约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn通过捕捉多样化交互模式和SSOS策略，显著提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但在结构化控制和编辑方面仍有挑战。

Result: MADI显著提升了扩散模型的编辑能力和结构化生成性能。

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用上下文生成架构中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，几何保真度高。

Conclusion: AortaDiff为心血管研究提供了一种端到端的实用解决方案，能生成高质量的CFD兼容网格。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少测试视觉蕴含能力，尤其是在拥挤场景中，因此提出了COREVQA来填补这一空白。

Method: 使用CrowdHuman数据集生成5608对图像和真假陈述，构建COREVQA基准测试。

Result: 即使表现最好的模型准确率也低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: COREVQA揭示了视觉语言模型在拥挤场景中视觉蕴含推理能力的显著局限性。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Conclusion: 基于集成的AI系统能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断工作流，但当前模型仅限于二元骨折检测，用于快速筛查而非详细分类。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU达85%，准确率90%），并发现4个新遗址。

Conclusion: AI技术与历史卫星影像结合，为考古遗址研究提供了突破性进展。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

Motivation: 准确预测驾驶意图对提升人机共驾系统的安全性和交互效率至关重要，但现有方法难以建模复杂的时空依赖和人类驾驶行为的不可预测性。

Method: 提出CaSTFormer模型，包含Reciprocal Shift Fusion（RSF）机制、Causal Pattern Extraction（CPE）模块和Feature Synthesis Network（FSN），分别用于特征对齐、消除虚假相关性和合成纯净表示。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上达到最优性能，有效捕捉复杂因果时空依赖，提升预测准确性和透明度。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer为驾驶意图预测提供了一种高效且透明的解决方案，推动了自动驾驶技术的发展。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating

Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，且MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，需要一种自监督且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 通过自校准方法，利用可靠的多视角点（n≥6）回归视差不确定性，结合MVS阶段的相关线索（如匹配成本值）。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了MVS阶段不确定性估计的空白，提供了鲁棒且可验证的不确定性量化。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的二阶总广义变分（TGV）公式，用于处理嵌入在三维空间中的三角网格上的法向量，并将其与现有方法在网格去噪实验中进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展离散TGV模型以处理流形值函数（如单位球面上的法向量），从而改进网格去噪效果。

Method: 构建了一个定制的切向Raviart-Thomas型有限元空间，将TGV公式扩展到流形设置。

Result: 新正则化器在网格去噪实验中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为处理流形值函数提供了有效的正则化工具，并在网格去噪中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized
variation (TGV) of the normal vector on an oriented, triangular mesh embedded
in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The normal vector is considered as a manifold-valued
function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous
discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a
Raviart-Thomas function space. To exctend this formulation to the manifold
setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods
in mesh denoising experiments.

Motivation: 基于Transformer的架构在视频生成任务中表现出色，但全注意力机制的二次复杂度成为高分辨率和长视频序列的关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出NABLA机制，利用块级注意力和自适应稀疏驱动阈值，无需定制低层算子设计，可与PyTorch的Flex Attention无缝集成。

Result: 实验显示NABLA在训练和推理速度上提升2.7倍，几乎不影响定量指标（CLIP分数、VBench分数、人工评估分数）和视觉质量。

Conclusion: NABLA有效解决了视频生成中的计算瓶颈问题，同时保持了生成质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成重放方法生成的样本可能因未捕捉领域特定细节而误导微调，导致知识遗忘。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中表现优于现有方法，平衡了可塑性、稳定性和零样本能力。

Conclusion: 通过LoRA适配生成器，显著提升了连续学习中视觉语言模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Motivation: 低质量扫描设备获取的点云通常包含大量噪声，导致表面重建不准确，需要一种方法直接从噪声数据中学习干净的表面表示。

Method: 基于Noise2Noise范式，提出NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF方法，通过最小化噪声SDF表示之间的MSE损失，实现隐式去噪和表面估计优化。

Result: 在ShapeNet、ABC、Famous和Real数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了噪声输入下的表面重建质量。

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF为从噪声点云中学习干净表面提供了一种有效方法，扩展了Noise2Noise范式到3D神经场。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取大量真实的模糊-清晰图像对困难且昂贵，研究从非配对数据中学习盲图像去模糊更具实际意义。现有方法依赖对抗学习，忽略了真实世界模糊的复杂性。

Method: 提出扩散模型框架，包括纹理先验编码器（TPE）和纹理转移变换器层（TTformer），结合小波对抗损失保留高频纹理细节。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为非监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性方法生成的SR图像模糊且感知质量差，因此需要一种能生成清晰且高保真SR图像的方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型，结合随机采样器（高阶ODE）和一步扩散（知识蒸馏）以提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将运行时间降至基线的1.6%，同时保持图像失真和感知质量的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在效率和SR质量之间取得了平衡，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

TL;DR: CoTasks框架通过分解复杂视频问题为四个实体级基础任务，显著提升了视频大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式推理能力，需要结构化标注支持逐步推理。

Method: 提出CoTasks框架，将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、空间和时间关系提取四个任务，嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B分别提升3.3和17.4分，尤其在因果、时间和描述性子类别表现突出。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为结构化链式推理监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动相机视角分离静态和动态物体对3D重建、自主导航和场景理解至关重要，但现有方法依赖光流，难以处理复杂场景。

Method: FoELS结合光流和纹理信息，通过计算扩展焦点（FoE）及其异常值生成初始运动概率，再与分割先验融合得到最终运动概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现出色，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS有效解决了复杂场景、相机旋转和平行运动等挑战，性能优越。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EPSilon提出了一种高效的混合3D化身生成方法，通过空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO）策略减少计算成本，显著提升训练和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于NeRF和SMPL网格的混合模型在生成逼真3D化身时，由于变形计算成本高导致推理速度慢。EPSilon旨在通过优化采样策略解决这一问题。

Method: EPSilon采用两种采样策略：ERO（省略空射线）和EIO（缩小采样区间），以减少无效采样点的计算。

Result: EPSilon仅需3.9%的采样点，推理速度提升约20倍，训练收敛速度提升4倍，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效的采样策略显著提升了3D化身生成的效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Conclusion: PW-FNet通过小波和傅里叶处理展示了图像恢复的潜力，为高效恢复模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

Motivation: RGB图像在3D手-物交互任务中存在几何模糊和严重遮挡，导致姿态估计困难。

Method: 采用MAE的掩码-重建策略，引入区域特定掩码比率分配和骨架驱动掩码引导，结合掩码SDF多模态学习。

Result: 实验表明，方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升姿态估计性能。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、无需手动调参的运动测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Result: 通过仿真实验，使用T-GOSPA准度量评估了几种贝叶斯MOT算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的准度量方法在MOT评估中更具灵活性，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Motivation: 研究StyleGAN生成器的工作原理，揭示其高效生成逼真图像的机制及其潜在滥用风险。

Method: 使用PyTorch训练StyleGAN模型，通过剪枝和潜在向量分析研究其权重和生成行为。

Result: 发现大量权重可被剪枝而不显著影响输出，且潜在向量能精确控制面部特征。

Conclusion: StyleGAN的高效性和可控性带来学术价值，但也存在被滥用于伪造身份的风险。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL有效平衡了旧类性能和新类适应能力。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Conclusion: EVS成功结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升视频生成质量与效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以准确捕捉HSI的高频细节，需要一种能有效恢复细节的方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型隐式学习HSI的光谱扩散先验（SDP），并通过SPIM动态引导模型恢复细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet上实验，性能提升约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM能有效提升HSI重建的细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

Motivation: 在图像分类中，当需要优先考虑可解释性和计算效率时，传统机器学习方法仍具价值。本文旨在探索PE在图像数据中的应用，结合经典特征提取方法，提供一种高效且可解释的分类方案。

Method: 扩展PE至二维图像，提出多尺度、多方向的熵特征提取方法，并融合HOG和LBP特征，形成780维特征集，用SVM分类器进行优化和评估。

Conclusion: PE结合经典特征提取方法为图像分类提供了一种轻量级、可解释且高效的替代方案，展示了熵描述符的潜力。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Method: 引入ClearVQA基准，针对VQA中三类常见模糊提问，涵盖多种场景。

Result: ClearVQA基准填补了评估VLMs通过交互解决模糊提问能力的空白。

Conclusion: ClearVQA为VQA领域提供了交互澄清的新方向，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Conclusion: 显式可微分聚类模块是一种简单有效的策略，可作为独立模型或现有方法的正则化器。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular

Result: DynFaceRestore在定量和定性评估中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在盲脸恢复中表现出鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时空建模显著提升了遮挡推理和3D场景补全的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Motivation: 现有IoT多模态感知系统存在模型复杂、模态对齐不充分和鲁棒性差的问题，限制了在资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 结合Mamba模型处理传感器时间序列，优化GRAM矩阵实现模态对齐，并引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上，GRAM-MAMBA显著降低了误差并提升了性能，同时训练参数极少。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA为资源受限环境中的高效鲁棒多模态感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性优化，显著提升了多模态遥感基础模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments

urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of
quantum-assisted Deep Learning frameworks for large-scale building segmentation
in urban environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth3DLane提出了一种双路径框架，结合自监督深度估计，无需昂贵传感器或真实深度数据，实现了单目3D车道检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵传感器或真实深度数据，且假设相机参数已知，限制了在无标定场景中的应用。

Method: 通过自监督深度网络获取点云，双路径分别提取空间和语义信息，结合3D车道锚点推断几何，并预测相机参数。

Result: 在OpenLane数据集上表现优异，且无需真实相机参数即可应用。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane解决了现有方法的局限性，适用于无标定场景。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像定制方法在实体级空间控制上存在局限性，缺乏绑定身份与精确位置的可扩展数据集。

Method: 构建双向生成范式的合成管道，设计轻量级位置调制层，解耦空间嵌入以独立控制主体位置。

Result: 实验表明，PositionIC能实现精确空间控制并保持图像定制的高一致性。

Conclusion: PositionIC为开放世界多实体场景的可控高保真图像定制提供了新方向，并将公开促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何处理内部参数知识与外部信息之间的冲突，通过引入多模态反事实查询数据集，定位并修改控制冲突的关键头部，从而引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在处理内部知识与外部信息冲突时产生的幻觉和不可靠响应问题，探索其机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位关键头部，修改这些头部以控制模型行为，并比较注意力与梯度归因的精度。

Result: 成功定位并修改了控制冲突的关键头部，注意力方法在定位视觉覆盖区域上优于梯度归因。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，并提出了一种通过修改关键头部引导模型行为的方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

TL;DR: PCR-GS是一种无需COLMAP的3D高斯溅射技术，通过相机姿态共正则化提升复杂场景下的3D建模和相机姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂相机轨迹场景下表现不佳，导致相机姿态估计和3D建模的局部最优问题。

Method: PCR-GS通过特征重投影正则化和基于小波的高频正则化优化相机姿态。

Result: 实验表明，PCR-GS在剧烈变化的相机轨迹下实现了优异的无姿态3D场景建模。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过双重视角正则化显著提升了复杂场景下的3D建模和相机姿态估计性能。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云特征表达能力有限的问题，尤其是反射率属性的弱区分能力，通过引入视觉基础模型的深度先验来丰富点云表示。

Method: 融合DepthAnything预测的深度先验与原始LiDAR属性，设计点级特征提取模块和双路径RoI特征提取框架（体素分支和点分支），并引入双向门控RoI特征融合模块。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升，验证了视觉基础模型先验在LiDAR 3D目标检测中的价值。

Conclusion: 通过融合视觉基础模型的深度先验，有效增强了LiDAR点云特征，提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Result: 在九个模型和四个任务中验证了感知能力与预测性能的强相关性，展示了通用框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对时间基础视频理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

TL;DR: DiViD是一种端到端的视频扩散框架，用于显式分离静态外观和动态运动，通过全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌实现，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的方法在视频中分离静态和动态信息时存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: DiViD采用序列编码器提取全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌，结合条件DDPM解码器，引入共享噪声计划、时间变化的KL瓶颈和交叉注意力机制。

Result: DiViD在真实世界基准测试中表现优异，实现了最高的交换联合准确率，保持静态保真度并减少交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD是一种有效的视频静态-动态分离框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Result: CSD-VAR在内容保留和风格化保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解提供了高效解决方案，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered surveillance have intensified concerns over the

increasingly focused on privacy-by-design solutions, raising the need for
objective techniques to evaluate privacy protection. This paper presents a
comprehensive framework for evaluating visual privacy-protection methods across
three dimensions: privacy, utility, and practicality. In addition, it
introduces HR-VISPR, a publicly available human-centric dataset with biometric,
soft-biometric, and non-biometric labels to train an interpretable privacy
metric. We evaluate 11 privacy protection methods, ranging from conventional
techniques to advanced deep-learning methods, through the proposed framework.
The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual
perception, while highlighting trade-offs between privacy, utility, and
practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

Result: 实验显示，VLA-Mark在PPL和BLEU上优于传统方法，检测准确率高达98.8%，攻击抵御能力达96.1%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark为质量保持的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior

Method: 研究采用回顾性多中心评估，使用103张站立位全脊柱X光片，由两位放射科医生独立测量作为参考标准，通过Bland-Altman分析、MAE、RMSE、Pearson相关系数和Cohen kappa评估AI与医生的一致性。

Result: AI与两位放射科医生的测量结果高度一致（MAE约3.9度，Pearson相关系数0.88-0.91），且分类严重程度的Cohen kappa达到0.51-0.64。

Conclusion: 该自动化软件能够复现专家水平的Cobb角测量和分类，有望优化临床工作流程中的脊柱侧弯报告和分诊。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

*Hao Fang,Sihao Teng,Hao Yu,Siyi Yuan,Huaiwu He,Zhe Liu,Yunjie Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种超轻量级量子辅助推理框架（QuantEIT），用于EIT图像重建，显著降低模型复杂度并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT具有高时间分辨率但逆问题病态，现有深度学习方法参数多且效率低。

Method: 结合并行2量子比特电路生成隐式非线性先验，通过单线性层重建电导率，无需训练数据。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上表现优于传统方法，仅用0.2%参数实现更高精度和抗噪性。

Conclusion: QuantEIT首次将量子电路引入EIT重建，为高效、鲁棒的床边监测提供新思路。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

Motivation: 精准农业需要早期检测植物叶片营养缺乏，以优化施肥和疾病管理。

Method: 使用多光谱成像和带Transformer注意力头的增强YOLOv5模型，处理九通道输入并捕捉细微症状。

Result: 模型在Dice分数和IoU上比基线YOLOv5提升约12%，尤其擅长检测叶绿素缺失和色素积累。

Conclusion: 结合多光谱成像和光谱-空间特征学习，有望推动植物表型和精准农业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate detection of nutrient deficiency in plant leaves is essential for
precision agriculture, enabling early intervention in fertilization, disease,
and stress management. This study presents a deep learning framework for leaf
anomaly segmentation using multispectral imaging and an enhanced YOLOv5 model
with a transformer-based attention head. The model is tailored for processing
nine-channel multispectral input and uses self-attention mechanisms to better
capture subtle, spatially-distributed symptoms. The plants in the experiments
were grown under controlled nutrient stress conditions for evaluation. We carry
out extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed model against the baseline
YOLOv5. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the baseline YOLOv5, with an average Dice score and IoU
(Intersection over Union) improvement of about 12%. In particular, this model
is effective in detecting challenging symptoms like chlorosis and pigment
accumulation. These results highlight the promise of combining multi-spectral
imaging with spectral-spatial feature learning for advancing plant phenotyping
and precision agriculture.

*Jiarong Ye,Sharon X. Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合情感与视觉内容的方法，通过三个组件（数据集、模型和编辑工具）实现情感驱动的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感驱动的图像编辑在创意产业中潜力巨大，但由于情感的抽象性和多样性，精确操作仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集（8M+图像，带情感标注）；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型，将情感映射为视觉属性；3. 提出Moodifier编辑模型，结合MLLMs实现情感转换。

Result: Moodifier在情感准确性和内容保留上优于现有方法，适用于多领域（如时尚、家居设计）。

Conclusion: 通过将抽象情感与具体视觉变化关联，该方法为情感内容创作提供了新可能。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba的MTR框架通过Mamba结构感知的重要性评分实现无需训练的token压缩，显著降低计算量且性能影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率，发现直接应用ViTs的token压缩技术会导致性能下降，需针对Mamba设计新方法。

Method: 提出Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，并基于此设计无需训练的MTR框架，可即插即用。

Result: 在Vim-B骨干上减少约40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: MTR为Vision Mamba提供高效token压缩方案，适用于多种任务和骨干网络。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Motivation: 探索冻结基础模型在皮肤病分类中的类增量学习潜力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 冻结FM主干，为每个任务训练轻量级MLP；同时探索零训练场景下的原型分类方法。

Result: 方法在性能上优于现有技术，且原型分类变体也表现优异。

Conclusion: 冻结FM在皮肤病持续学习中具有强大潜力，适合实际医疗应用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但收集敏感数据引发隐私问题，研究旨在评估匿名化技术对检测性能的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用四种匿名化技术（模糊、掩码、加密、虚拟人替换），并评估四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）。

Result: 实验表明，匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）甚至能提升AUC性能，具体效果取决于算法设计。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，并强调了隐私保护与检测效用的权衡，为平衡隐私与检测需求提供了基准和见解。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的框架，通过结合连接的重叠图和极线几何，在多视角中鲁棒地关联对象检测，适用于噪声和视觉不可区分的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外观特征或几何约束，但在对象视觉不可区分或噪声干扰时效果不佳，因此需要一种更鲁棒的关联方法。

Method: C-DOG通过连接的重叠图建模和极线几何关联检测，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差剔除不一致观测。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于基于几何的基线方法，在高密度对象、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠等挑战下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于实际场景中的可扩展3D重建，尤其在噪声和视觉不可区分条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专有视觉模型（如DINOv2、CLIP等）性能虽强，但缺乏透明度和开源支持。Franca旨在提供高性能且完全开源的替代方案，同时解决SSL聚类方法的不足。

Method: 使用公开数据（ImageNet-21K和ReLAION-2B子集），采用透明训练流程，引入多头的Matryoshka表示聚类投影器和位置解耦策略。

Result: Franca在多个下游任务中表现优异，证明了干净特征空间的有效性。

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能的视觉模型设立了新标准，推动了可复现和通用基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT是一种基于图的架构，用于优化LLM驱动的交通管理任务，通过并行执行和动态资源分配，显著降低了令牌消耗和响应延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于链的系统（如TrafficGPT）存在顺序任务执行、高令牌使用和扩展性差的问题，无法满足复杂交通场景的需求。

Method: 提出GraphTrafficGPT，将任务及其依赖关系表示为有向图中的节点和边，引入Brain Agent分解查询并协调多个专业代理。

Result: 实验显示，GraphTrafficGPT令牌消耗减少50.2%，响应延迟降低19.0%，多查询执行效率提升23.0%。

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT通过图结构和并行处理，显著提升了LLM在交通管理中的效率和扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

TL;DR: PrefPalette是一个框架，通过分解偏好到属性维度并基于社区价值观预测偏好，优于GPT-4o 46.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好模型将人类判断视为黑箱，缺乏对偏好背后原因的理解。

Method: PrefPalette采用多属性决策原则，包括生成合成数据以隔离属性效果，以及基于注意力的偏好建模。

Result: 在45个Reddit社区中，PrefPalette预测准确率显著优于GPT-4o，并揭示了社区特定的偏好特征。

Conclusion: PrefPalette不仅提升了偏好预测性能，还提供了透明、可解释的洞察，为更可信的个性化应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large

generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the

environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art

computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 当前AI主要建模像素和文字，但世界由实体及其关系构成，应直接建模这些实体。关系学习虽重要，却未广泛应用。

Result: 关系学习仅在少数受限案例中成功，需进一步研究以提升其应用。

Conclusion: 关系学习应成为AI的核心方向，需更多研究以实现其潜力。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别和干预轻度认知障碍（MCI）可延缓AD进展，但诊断AD因多模态数据的选择偏差和变量间复杂关系而具有挑战性。

Method: 结合MRI、fMRI图像和LLM生成的文本数据，通过因果干预消除混杂因素，分类CN/MCI/AD。

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD上表现优异，达到SOTA指标。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决学生在多步任务中合并步骤时导致的组合爆炸问题，提高错误诊断的效率和准确性。

Method: 设计了一种基于最终答案的诊断服务，通过自动完成任务并诊断解决方案来识别错误规则。

Result: 在二次方程求解任务中，该方法能诊断29.4%的未诊断步骤，且与教师诊断结果的一致性达97%。

Conclusion: 该方法为智能辅导系统中的错误诊断提供了有效基础，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型追踪和基于约束建模的方法，用于诊断学生在多步任务中的输入，并在解决二次方程的数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合两种诊断方法的优势，以更灵活地诊断学生输入，即使学生将多个步骤合并为一步。

Method: 通过定义约束作为学生输入与策略步骤的共同属性，设计并评估了一个多步策略诊断系统。

Result: 系统诊断与教师编码在所有140个学生步骤中完全一致。

Conclusion: 该方法在多步任务诊断中具有潜力，能够有效识别学生的策略偏差。

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

Motivation: 现有本体可视化工具无法有效展示本体结构和依赖关系，限制了用户对大型本体的理解。

Method: OntView采用DL推理器，遵循“所见即所得”原则，支持General Concept Inclusions（GCI）的可视化，并提供简化视图功能（如本体摘要、聚焦TBox元素、动态隐藏/显示分支）。

Result: OntView成功实现了直观的本体可视化，并避免了信息过载，已开源供社区使用。

Conclusion: OntView为本体可视化提供了创新解决方案，显著提升了用户对复杂本体结构的理解能力。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.
OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and
summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and
enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

Motivation: 现有时间图神经网络（T-GNNs）因计算开销大而面临可扩展性和效率问题，EAGLE旨在解决这些问题。

Method: EAGLE包含时间感知模块（聚合最近邻信息）和结构感知模块（利用时间个性化PageRank），并通过自适应权重机制平衡两者。

Result: 在七个真实世界时间图上，EAGLE在性能和效率上均优于现有T-GNNs，速度提升超过50倍。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过简化架构和动态调整机制，实现了高效且有效的时间链路预测。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

Conclusion: 因果知识转移框架为多智能体强化学习在非平稳环境中的知识共享提供了有效途径，但其效果依赖于环境与目标的交互。

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary
results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI
collaboration.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric

a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,

limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.

G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into

real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are

eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created

tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型对GPU计算资源的需求激增，亟需自动化CUDA优化策略。

Method: 提出CUDA-L1，一种基于强化学习的框架，通过速度提升奖励信号优化CUDA内核。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100上平均加速17.7倍，峰值达449倍，且在多GPU架构上表现优异。

Conclusion: CUDA-L1展示了强化学习在自动化CUDA优化中的潜力，可显著提升GPU效率。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Conclusion: DyG-RAG 为时间敏感的复杂查询提供了更准确和一致的解决方案，推动了时间感知生成的发展。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can perform recommendation tasks by taking
prompts written in natural language as input. Compared to traditional methods
such as collaborative filtering, LLM-based recommendation offers advantages in
handling cold-start, cross-domain, and zero-shot scenarios, as well as
supporting flexible input formats and generating explanations of user behavior.
In this paper, we focus on a single-user setting, where no information from
other users is used. This setting is practical for privacy-sensitive or
data-limited applications. In such cases, prompt engineering becomes especially
important for controlling the output generated by the LLM. We conduct a
large-scale comparison of 23 prompt types across 8 public datasets and 12 LLMs.
We use statistical tests and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate both
accuracy and inference cost. Our results show that for cost-efficient LLMs,
three types of prompts are especially effective: those that rephrase
instructions, consider background knowledge, and make the reasoning process
easier to follow. For high-performance LLMs, simple prompts often outperform
more complex ones while reducing cost. In contrast, commonly used prompting
styles in natural language processing, such as step-by-step reasoning, or the
use of reasoning models often lead to lower accuracy. Based on these findings,
we provide practical suggestions for selecting prompts and LLMs depending on
the required balance between accuracy and cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出IP2方法，通过分析新闻实体在扫描和标题阅读阶段的作用，改进新闻推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻推荐方法忽视了实体在用户阅读行为中的独特作用，尤其是在扫描和标题阅读阶段。

Method: IP2方法包括：1）基于Transformer的实体编码器聚合新闻标题中的实体；2）签名实体-标题对比预训练；3）双塔用户编码器捕捉跨新闻实体兴趣；4）跨塔注意力链接校准标题阅读兴趣。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，IP2在新闻推荐任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IP2通过显式建模实体在阅读行为中的作用，显著提升了新闻推荐的效果。

Abstract: News recommender systems aim to provide personalized news reading experiences
for users based on their reading history. Behavioral science studies suggest
that screen-based news reading contains three successive steps: scanning, title
reading, and then clicking. Adhering to these steps, we find that intra-news
entity interest dominates the scanning stage, while the inter-news entity
interest guides title reading and influences click decisions. Unfortunately,
current methods overlook the unique utility of entities in news recommendation.
To this end, we propose a novel method called IP2 to probe entity-guided
reading interest at both intra- and inter-news levels. At the intra-news level,
a Transformer-based entity encoder is devised to aggregate mentioned entities
in the news title into one signature entity. Then, a signature entity-title
contrastive pre-training is adopted to initialize entities with proper meanings
using the news story context, which in the meantime facilitates us to probe for
intra-news entity interest. As for the inter-news level, a dual tower user
encoder is presented to capture inter-news reading interest from both the title
meaning and entity sides. In addition to highlighting the contribution of
inter-news entity guidance, a cross-tower attention link is adopted to
calibrate title reading interest using inter-news entity interest, thus further
aligning with real-world behavior. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate that our IP2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in news
recommendation.

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching
tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching
locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and
cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g.,
music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest
significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these
suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several
fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of
the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the
POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The
first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state
of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings
across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation
methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized
benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model
design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system
performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that,
starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future
work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection,
trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种架构（RAG和GraphRAG），将药物副作用知识集成到Llama 3 8B语言模型中，显著提升了药物副作用检索的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物副作用是全球健康问题，现有大语言模型（LLMs）在药物警戒等专业领域存在局限性，如依赖黑盒训练数据、易产生幻觉和缺乏领域知识。

Method: 提出Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)和GraphRAG两种架构，结合药物副作用知识库，对19,520种药物副作用关联进行评估。

Result: GraphRAG在药物副作用检索中达到接近完美的准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为药物警戒应用提供了高精度、可扩展的解决方案，是LLMs在关键领域应用的重要进展。

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced
methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,
including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to
hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability
in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose
two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which
integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language
model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations
(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that
GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This
framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a
significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance
applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过在不同条件下生成SPARQL查询来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识图谱问答（KGQA）中的表现，以揭示训练数据对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在KGQA中的应用存在训练数据不可控的问题，可能导致性能评估失真。研究旨在量化训练数据对LLMs生成SPARQL查询能力的影响。

Method: 设计了三种实验条件：零样本SPARQL生成、知识注入和匿名知识注入，以评估LLMs在不同场景下的表现。

Result: 方法具有可移植性和鲁棒性，适用于任何知识图谱和LLM，能一致地揭示LLMs的真实能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估LLMs在KGQA中的实际能力提供了新工具，有助于识别性能提升是否源于训练数据的记忆效应。

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合神经语言模型和知识图谱的两步方法，用于个性化学术搜索，显著提升了检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化学术搜索模型难以全面捕捉用户的学术兴趣，尤其是引用图中的潜在结构未被充分利用。

Method: 首先训练神经语言模型进行检索，然后将学术图转化为知识图谱，并通过翻译嵌入技术将其与语言模型嵌入共享语义空间。

Result: 在四个学术搜索领域中，该方法在三个领域优于传统模型，MAP@100最高提升10%。

Conclusion: 基于知识图谱的用户模型在提升检索效果方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Academic Search is a search task aimed to manage and retrieve scientific
documents like journal articles and conference papers. Personalization in this
context meets individual researchers' needs by leveraging, through user
profiles, the user related information (e.g. documents authored by a
researcher), to improve search effectiveness and to reduce the information
overload. While citation graphs are a valuable means to support the outcome of
recommender systems, their use in personalized academic search (with, e.g.
nodes as papers and edges as citations) is still under-explored.
  Existing personalized models for academic search often struggle to fully
capture users' academic interests. To address this, we propose a two-step
approach: first, training a neural language model for retrieval, then
converting the academic graph into a knowledge graph and embedding it into a
shared semantic space with the language model using translational embedding
techniques. This allows user models to capture both explicit relationships and
hidden structures in citation graphs and paper content. We evaluate our
approach in four academic search domains, outperforming traditional graph-based
and personalized models in three out of four, with up to a 10\% improvement in
MAP@100 over the second-best model. This highlights the potential of knowledge
graph-based user models to enhance retrieval effectiveness.

Motivation: 现代推荐系统难以捕捉动态和上下文丰富的用户偏好，传统方法在时间模式和语义理解上存在不足。

Method: 结合LSTM的时间建模能力和LLM的语义推理能力，设计DUALRec模型。

Result: 在MovieLens-1M数据集上，DUALRec在HR@k、NDCG@k和类型相似性指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DUALRec填补了时间序列建模与语义推理之间的空白，为智能推荐系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of
modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences.
Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to
capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their
strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently
designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On
the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which
is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user
preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for
comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec
(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that
leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the
temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of
the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users
evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM
variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies
that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that
the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with
comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes
a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling
and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more
intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

Result: 证明了纳什均衡的存在性和唯一性，并验证了模型在智能交通中的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能推广到现有模型（如Receding Horizon和Blotto博弈），并提供了计算纳什均衡的有效方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of multi-stage resource allocation games
that model real-world scenarios in which profitability depends on the balance
between supply and demand, and where higher resource investment leads to
greater returns. Our proposed framework, which incorporates the notion of
profit loss due to insufficient player participation, gives rise to a
Tullock-like functional form of the stage payoff structure when weighted fair
proportional resource allocation is applied. We explore both centralized and
Nash equilibrium strategies, establish sufficient conditions for their
existence and uniqueness, and provide an iterative, semi-decentralized method
to compute the Nash equilibrium in games with arbitrarily many players.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the framework generalizes instances of
several existing models, including Receding Horizon and Blotto games, and
present a semi-analytical method for computing the unique Nash equilibrium
within the Blotto setup. Our findings are validated through a numerical case
study in smart mobility, highlighting the practical relevance and applicability
of the proposed model.

Motivation: 解决在线不可分割杂务分配中的公平性问题，填补现有研究的理论空白。

Method: 通过理论证明和算法设计，提出了一种适用于一般情况的在线分配算法。

Result: 证明了对于固定的n和ε，无法保证(n-ε)-MMS分配；同时提出了一种算法，保证了min{n, O(k), O(log D)}-MMS分配。

Conclusion: 尽管存在理论上的限制，但提出的算法在多种实际场景下表现良好，特别是在个性化双值情况下优化了常数。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of indivisible chores among $n$ agents
in an online setting, where items arrive sequentially and must be allocated
irrevocably upon arrival. The goal is to produce an $\alpha$-MMS allocation at
the end. Several recent works have investigated this model, but have only
succeeded in obtaining non-trivial algorithms under restrictive assumptions,
such as the two-agent bi-valued special case (Wang and Wei, 2025), or by
assuming knowledge of the total disutility of each agent (Zhou, Bai, and Wu,
2023). For the general case, the trivial $n$-MMS guarantee remains the best
known, while the strongest lower bound is still only $2$.
  We close this gap on the negative side by proving that for any fixed $n$ and
$\varepsilon$, no algorithm can guarantee an $(n - \varepsilon)$-MMS
allocation. Notably, this lower bound holds precisely for every $n$, without
hiding constants in big-$O$ notation, thereby exactly matching the trivial
upper bound.
  Despite this strong impossibility result, we also present positive results.
We provide an online algorithm that applies in the general case, guaranteeing a
$\min\{n, O(k), O(\log D)\}$-MMS allocation, where $k$ is the maximum number of
distinct disutilities across all agents and $D$ is the maximum ratio between
the largest and smallest disutilities for any agent. This bound is reasonable
across a broad range of scenarios and, for example, implies that we can achieve
an $O(1)$-MMS allocation whenever $k$ is constant. Moreover, to optimize the
constant in the important personalized bi-valued case, we show that if each
agent has at most two distinct disutilities, our algorithm guarantees a $(2 +
\sqrt{3}) \approx 3.7$-MMS allocation.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，SEER优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SEER通过语义增强和情感推理，显著提升了多模态假新闻检测的性能。

Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application
of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement
effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional
features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to
contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel
Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake
news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic
understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic
enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity
and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that
simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the
authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 物理模型为Transformer架构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

Motivation: 传统归一化方法（如均值标准差或固定范围缩放）在机器学习中常见，但Copula理论中的CDF归一化方法（将数据转换为近似均匀分布）在机器学习中几乎未被探索。论文旨在展示其优势。

Method: 通过将传统归一化替换为CDF归一化，应用于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)，并与Legendre-KAN进行对比。

Result: CDF归一化显著提升了KANs的预测性能。

Conclusion: CDF归一化在机器学习中具有潜力，尤其在KANs中表现优异，同时支持概率分布传播和方向调整。

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a
fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization
to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF
(cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1],
allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems
nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some
its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs), improving predictions from Legendre-KAN by just switching rescaling to
CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons
are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate
also probability distributions, and change propagation direction.

Result: 在六个时域数据集上验证，分类准确率高且训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多源数据的复杂系统，提供高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to
automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on
manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to
input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions
and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.
Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies
either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study
introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates
short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.
Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics
human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance
generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted
using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method
consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning
architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves
particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering
a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in
healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness

*Jiaxiang Yi,Bernardo P. Ferreira,Miguel A. Bessa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种层次化的数据驱动学习方法，能够处理历史依赖的多保真度数据，并量化认知不确定性，同时将其与数据噪声（随机不确定性）分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多保真度数据驱动学习中量化认知不确定性和噪声分离的问题，以提升模型在科学和工程领域的适用性。

Method: 采用层次化方法，从简单的单保真度确定性神经网络扩展到多保真度方差估计贝叶斯循环神经网络。

Result: 方法在多保真度数据驱动建模中表现出色，能准确预测响应、量化模型误差，并发现噪声分布（若存在）。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来科学和工程领域中的不确定性设计和分析提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method
accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also
discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for
future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains;
especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under
uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法Soft-ECM，用于处理复杂数据（如混合数据和时间序列）的聚类问题，克服了现有基于置信函数的聚类算法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于置信函数的聚类算法无法处理复杂数据（如混合数据或非表格数据），因为它们依赖于欧几里得空间的性质。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 重新定义了Evidential C-Means（ECM）问题，提出Soft-ECM算法，仅需半度量即可定位不精确簇的质心。

Result: 实验表明，Soft-ECM在数值数据上的表现与传统模糊聚类方法相当，并能有效处理混合数据和时间序列数据。

Conclusion: Soft-ECM为复杂数据的聚类提供了一种有效的解决方案，扩展了基于置信函数的聚类算法的应用范围。

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的框架，用于实时评估空中交通管制员（ATCO）的任务需求，通过可解释的注意力机制预测未来指令数量，并优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂性指标难以捕捉空中交通管制任务中的细微操作驱动因素，尤其是在拥挤空域中。

Method: 采用基于注意力的图神经网络（GNN）框架，从静态交通场景中预测未来指令数量，并通过系统性地消融飞机来生成可解释的任务需求评分。

Result: 该框架显著优于启发式方法，并比现有基线更可靠地评估场景复杂性，能够将任务需求归因于特定飞机。

Conclusion: 该工具为控制器培训和空域重新设计提供了新的复杂性分析途径。

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种新的离线策略评估（OPE）方法DiPS和DPR，专门针对匹配市场设计，解决了传统方法在双向用户交互中的方差和奖励稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配市场中的双向用户交互和大规模数据导致传统OPE方法不可靠，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 结合直接方法（DM）、逆倾向得分（IPS）和双重稳健（DR）估计器，并引入中间标签（如初始参与信号）来优化偏差-方差控制。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，DiPS和DPR在偏差和方差控制上优于传统方法，并能扩展到离线策略学习。

Conclusion: 新方法在匹配市场的离线评估和学习任务中表现优异，为频繁策略更新提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of
services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating
applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new
policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and
impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays
a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only
offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike
conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature
of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and
exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address
these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel
OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for
matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM),
Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while
incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to
achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we
derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their
advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these
estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for
improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically
evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing
logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the
superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and
learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨模态自监督预训练方法，用于从大规模未标记的IMU-视频数据中学习表示，提高了HAR任务在分布外数据上的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有HAR方法依赖特定标签、泛化性差的问题，特别是在不同环境或人群中的IMU数据。

Method: 采用跨模态自监督预训练方法，结合IMU和视频数据学习通用表示。

Result: 在零样本和少样本评估中，该方法优于当前最先进的IMU-视频预训练和仅IMU预训练方法。

Conclusion: 跨模态预训练是学习动态数据模态（如IMU信号）通用表示的有效工具。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出基于模型的智能体作为模型无关强化学习的替代方案，以提高样本效率、安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型无关强化学习（RL）在复杂系统中存在样本效率低、学习不安全及可解释性差的问题，因此需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 引入基于模型的智能体，利用系统动态、成本和约束的可适应模型进行安全策略学习，并结合模型无关RL弥补模型不匹配的缺陷。

Result: 基于模型的智能体（如模型预测控制）能够通过编码先验知识提高决策的安全性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型和模型无关RL的方法，有望实现样本高效、安全且可解释的决策智能体。

Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty
has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across
fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled
decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system
interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL
has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function
approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's
policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify
the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited
interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces
model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy
approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and
constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system
knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,
while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We
outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --
exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning
approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,
along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been
established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored,
motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient
learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

Result: 竞赛旨在推动解决LLM安全威胁的新方法。

Conclusion: 该竞赛为AI安全领域的研究提供了重要平台，尤其针对LLM的潜在威胁。

Abstract: The "Fake or Real" competition hosted on Kaggle
(\href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt}{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt})
is the second part of a series of follow-up competitions and hackathons related
to the "Assurance for Space Domain AI Applications" project funded by the
European Space Agency
(\href{https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/}{https://assurance-ai.space-codev.org/}).
The competition idea is based on two real-life AI security threats identified
within the project -- data poisoning and overreliance in Large Language Models.
The task is to distinguish between the proper output from LLM and the output
generated under malicious modification of the LLM. As this problem was not
extensively researched, participants are required to develop new techniques to
address this issue or adjust already existing ones to this problem's statement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ICL的机制，解释LLMs如何通过内部化提示的数据生成过程（DGP）结构来超越预训练阶段的学习。

Method: 引入双收敛框架，分析隐藏表示在上下文和层间的收敛过程，证明其对平滑（低频）表示的隐式偏好。

Result: 理论解释了ICL的多个现象，如表示的几何结构、能量衰减及对高频噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL的机制提供了新见解，并为其理论分析奠定了基础，未来可扩展到更广泛的数据分布和设置。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new
behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent
studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in
pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating
process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the
mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we
present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a
unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge
both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to
an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove
analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical
observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured
but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without
vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness
towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results
provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical
foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data
distributions and settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Acoustic Index的新型AI衍生超声心动图参数，用于量化心脏功能障碍，结合了Koopman算子理论和混合神经网络，在736名患者的队列中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声心动图参数（如EF和GLS）在早期检测心脏功能障碍方面存在局限性，需要一种可重复、可解释且操作独立的参数。

Method: 结合Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition（基于Koopman算子理论）和混合神经网络，提取超声心动图序列的时空动态，并通过注意力机制和流形学习融合临床数据。

Result: 在独立测试集中，Acoustic Index的AUC为0.89，交叉验证显示敏感性和特异性均超过0.8。

Conclusion: Acoustic Index是一种物理信息驱动的可解释AI生物标志物，有望成为早期检测和监测心脏功能的工具。

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种指标（谱可预测性评分和最大李雅普诺夫指数）来量化时间序列的可预测性，帮助在模型开发前评估数据的固有特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型评估指标在模型开发后才使用，而这两种指标能在模型开发前评估数据的可预测性，帮助优化资源分配和策略制定。

Method: 使用谱可预测性评分评估时间序列的频率成分强度和规律性，李雅普诺夫指数量化系统的混沌性和稳定性。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据（M5预测竞赛数据集）上验证，这两种指标能准确反映时间序列的固有可预测性，并与实际预测性能强相关。

Conclusion: 通过提前评估时间序列的可预测性，实践者可以优化资源分配，对可预测性强的产品投入更多资源，对可预测性差的产品采取替代策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

TL;DR: SELF-Transformer通过迭代更新注意力权重提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，无需依赖自回归，在测试时根据输入难度调整计算量，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，避免依赖自回归机制，模仿生物大脑的迭代推理方式。

Method: 引入SELF-Transformer，通过迭代更新注意力权重至固定点，动态调整测试时的计算量。

Result: 在编码器基准测试中实现高达20%的准确率提升，参数数量不变。

Conclusion: SELF-Transformer通过输入自适应对齐，显著提升表达能力，同时保持编码器架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that
power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a
3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural
innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and
ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts
PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse
computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality

are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via
responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,
then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional
languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public

TL;DR: PLUS框架通过生成用户偏好摘要，实现个性化LLM响应，优于传统RLHF方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLHF无法捕捉用户多样性，需个性化响应。

Method: 提出PLUS框架，利用文本摘要学习用户偏好，结合强化学习更新奖励模型。

Result: PLUS生成的摘要能有效捕捉用户偏好，适应新用户和多样话题，并可迁移至GPT-4。

Conclusion: PLUS提供透明、可解释的用户控制，提升LLM个性化能力。

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

Motivation: 解决GCN在处理大规模复杂图数据时的过平滑和过压缩问题，以及Graph Transformer在异构图数据上的性能限制。

Method: 提出Tri-GFN框架，整合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer模块，通过三学习机制和特征融合策略优化全局与局部信息。

Result: 在ACM、Reuters和USPS数据集上分别提升0.87%、14.14%和7.58%的准确率，特别适用于新闻分类和主题检索。

Conclusion: Tri-GFN通过多模块融合和三学习机制显著提升了图聚类性能，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made
significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges
such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale
and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.
Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,
its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To
address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework
that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the
Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the
differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a
unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The
framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components
are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes
the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust
clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning
among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to
capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations
for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the
Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding
performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news
classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Result: 在UCI-HAR和MNIST数据集上，FedSkipTwin减少12-15.5%通信量，模型精度提升0.5%。

Conclusion: 预测引导的跳过策略是带宽受限边缘环境中资源感知联邦学习的实用有效方法。

Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning
(FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with
constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel
client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins.
Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical
sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic
uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions,
requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold;
otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth.
Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients
under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin
reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously
improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the
standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided
skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in
bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

Conclusion: GRU-KAN和LSTM-KAN在贷款违约早期预测中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection:
enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three
months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping
financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events
materialize. Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of
accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing
within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their
practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study
introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against
the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms
of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature
window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months

Conclusion: 通过新方法，PI-GNNs在高密度组合优化问题中的性能得到显著改善。

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

Result: EHVI在Pareto前沿覆盖、收敛速度和化学多样性上均优于EI。

Conclusion: Pareto感知的获取策略在分子优化中具有实际优势，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework
for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical
advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a
simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) --
against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement
(EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process
surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization
tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front
coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization
encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our
results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in
low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical
advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization,
especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

Conclusion: AST方法通过结合标记化和注意力机制，实现了高效且可扩展的可变形体交互模拟，并贡献了一个新的大规模数据集。

Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like
material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods
with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical
systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body
interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have
to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical
for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from
geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)
method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the
simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this
structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then
apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,
fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.
Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens
in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and
the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable
simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable
body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations
with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by
computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale
dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support
future research in this area.

Conclusion: 对抗训练在音频分类中具有提升鲁棒性的潜力，适用于数据分布变化和对抗攻击的挑战性场景。

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under
substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different
adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and
adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model
architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an
inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach
is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This
benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training
and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a
common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial
training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the
classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks
designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used
for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses
the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.
Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space
attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative
and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These
findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial
training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution
shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

Conclusion: SamGoG能有效解决图分类任务中的双重不平衡问题，并与多种GNN无缝集成。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a
15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more
advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational
demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained
environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory
usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the
future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by
employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research
introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based
semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to
search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using
the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic
quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for
PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on
the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new
state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining
an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately
70%.

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in
accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown
impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often
ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space.
However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing
more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to
adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore,
the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is
unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow
model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference
procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design,
demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to
baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based
generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for
model design.

Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it
presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently,
goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with
contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable
attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and
existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a
single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to
incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel
Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution
properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution
and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as
a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning,
which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning.
Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature
center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center
optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior
performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from
first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has
become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training
datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a
computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare
events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation
models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular
databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data
necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach
requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can
still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events
and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.
In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely
automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the
model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with
classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying
this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to
assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even
though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In
this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach
based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow
that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified
accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them
at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经因果模型多假设静态因果图，忽略了因果交互的动态性，因此需要一种新理论来动态表示因果结构。

Method: 提出Causal Process框架及其实现Causal Process Model，通过RL代理构建动态因果图假设，类似于Transformer的注意力机制。

Result: 在RL环境中，该方法在因果表示学习和代理性能上优于现有方法，并能恢复动态因果过程的图结构。

Conclusion: Causal Process框架为动态因果结构提供了新理论支持，其实现模型在RL任务中表现出色，具有可解释性。

Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern
trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival
of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural
networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality
assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal
interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel
theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,
we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This
allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer
networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal
processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to
constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested
within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we
employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the
original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in
causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover
graphs of dynamic causal processes.

Conclusion: 图像化表示蛋白质为深度学习在生物分子模拟中的应用开辟了新途径，框架可扩展至其他复杂3D结构。

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Result: 在真实和合成网络中验证，新方法在异常检测中表现优于六种基线模型。

Conclusion: 平均可控性作为额外指标能显著提升图机器学习模型在稀疏和不平衡数据集中的异常检测性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the
need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of
anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have
emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to
uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates
the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning
with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can
significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two
novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based
frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2)
encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on
real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our
proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies,
highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the
performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the
potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to
address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine
learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a
lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for
what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This
variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will
perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such
differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim
to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation
for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained
and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary
texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities
(Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is
ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for
signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are
the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome
(SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for
neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and
generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have
acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging
consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -
such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate
these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or
overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a
site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across
diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a
simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this
framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected
autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a
top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight
prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior
preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as
reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although
the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly
modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world
multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our
results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization
performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly
well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in
large-scale multi-site SC studies.

Motivation: 现有方法在时间序列预测中对长短期依赖赋予等权重并非最优，需动态调整。

Method: 提出ParallelTime Weighter动态计算权重，并结合ParallelTime架构实现高效预测。

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高且参数少。

Conclusion: ParallelTime为时间序列预测中的并行Attention-Mamba架构提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two
architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural
language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window
attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing
long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to
both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to
long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we
propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates
interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token
based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the
ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter
mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.
Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer
parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly
outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for
future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The
implementation is readily available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态规划方法在静态CVaR优化中的失败原因，并探索其根本问题。

Method: 通过将政策评估任务分解为两个最小化问题，分析风险分配一致性约束，并量化CVaR评估误差。

Result: 发现评估误差源于约束集的空交集，并证明对偶CVaR分解无法在所有初始风险级别上找到单一最优策略。

Conclusion: 对偶CVaR分解在寻找全局最优策略时存在根本限制，需进一步研究其他方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding
static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when
based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained
unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization
to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the
static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization
problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency
constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of
the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation
errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then
demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR
DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.
We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the
search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR
decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single
policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for
Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated
GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively
learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents
exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial
behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local
predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global
model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the
cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused
GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of
the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy
improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR.
Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

Conclusion: DONUT为X射线科学中的实时分析提供了高效解决方案，克服了监督学习的局限性。

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the
fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While
advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis
remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational
demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to
spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by
the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To
address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by
Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid
and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a
differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture,
DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time.
Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or
pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine
learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately
extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than

### [162] [Noradrenergic-inspired gain modulation attenuates the stability gap in joint training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14056)
*Alejandro Rodriguez-Garcia,Anindya Ghosh,Srikanth Ramaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了持续学习中的稳定性差距问题，提出了一种基于不确定性调制的增益动态机制来平衡新任务学习和旧任务记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中存在稳定性差距，即在学习新任务时对已掌握任务的性能下降，这与持续学习的目标相矛盾。研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 受生物大脑多时间尺度动态启发，提出不确定性调制增益动态机制，模拟两时间尺度优化器，动态平衡知识整合与旧任务干扰。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR基准测试中，该机制有效减少了稳定性差距。

Conclusion: 不确定性调制增益动态机制不仅解决了稳定性差距问题，还为持续学习提供了新的生物启发方法。

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

*Ni Mu,Yao Luan,Qing-Shan Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于偏好的多目标强化学习方法（Pb-MORL），通过偏好指导策略优化，避免了复杂的奖励设计，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标强化学习依赖预定义的奖励函数，设计复杂且难以平衡冲突目标，偏好作为更灵活的决策指导可以解决这一问题。

Method: Pb-MORL将偏好整合到MORL框架中，构建与偏好一致的多目标奖励模型，并证明优化该模型等价于训练帕累托最优策略。

Result: 在多个基准任务和实际应用（如能源管理和自动驾驶）中，Pb-MORL表现优于使用真实奖励函数的基准方法。

Conclusion: Pb-MORL展示了在复杂现实系统中应用的潜力，提供了一种更直观且有效的多目标优化方法。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for
optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on
pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing
conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as
more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for
complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL
(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL
framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across
the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our
method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given
preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this
reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive
experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,
and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method
performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground
truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications
in complex real-world systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLM）代理难以准确建模复杂的人类心智特征（如领域意图），尤其是在缺乏直接沟通的情况下。

Method: 提出DPMT框架，结合多尺度心智理论（ToM）模块，通过心智特征推理实现稳健的人类伙伴建模。

Result: 实验表明，DPMT显著提升了人类与AI的协作效果，消融研究进一步验证了多尺度ToM在慢系统中的贡献。

Conclusion: DPMT框架为解决人类与AI协作中的心智建模问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet
challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human
behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents
often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as
domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of
mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process
theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) perform well on raw imbalanced data but conflict with conventional imbalance strategies and have high computational costs. MLPs with imbalance techniques match KANs' performance more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate KANs' effectiveness in class-imbalanced classification compared to MLPs and assess their compatibility with standard imbalance strategies.

Method: Empirical evaluation using ten benchmark datasets, comparing KANs and MLPs with and without imbalance techniques.

Result: KANs perform well on raw imbalanced data but degrade with resampling or focal loss. MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve similar performance at lower costs.

Conclusion: KANs are a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data but face performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard techniques, requiring future research.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，数据常为高维且不规则，传统方法难以有效提取因果信息，因此需要一种新框架来处理此类数据。

Method: 提出CaRTeD框架，结合时间因果表示学习与非规则张量分解，提供灵活的规范化设计和下游任务支持。

Result: 理论证明算法收敛到稳定点，实验在合成和真实数据（如MIMIC-III）上表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CaRTeD填补了非规则张量分解的理论空白，提升了因果表示的可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering
complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as
low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.

*Michael Elkin,Chhaya Trehan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的集中式和并行算法，用于解决有向图中的$S \times V$可达性问题，并扩展到近似距离计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有算法在特定参数范围内效率不足的问题，特别是在$\sigma$的某些区间内。

Method: 利用Kogan和Parter的快捷构造技术，开发了基于矩形矩阵乘法指数的集中式算法，并改进了并行算法的工作复杂度。

Result: 新算法在$\tilde \sigma \leq \sigma \leq 0.53$范围内优于现有算法，并在树宽较小的图上表现更优。

Conclusion: 论文显著提升了$S \times V$可达性问题的计算效率，并扩展到其他图族和近似距离计算。

Abstract: Given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge digraph $G = (V,E)$ and a subset $S \subseteq V$
of $|S| = n^{\sigma}$ (for some $0 \le \sigma \le 1$) designated sources, the
$S \times V$ reachability problem is to compute the sets $\mathcal V_s$ of
vertices reachable from $s$, for every $s \in S$. Naive centralized algorithms
run BFS/DFS from each source in $O(m \cdot n^{\sigma})$ time or compute $G$'s
transitive closure in $\hat O(n^{\omega})$ time, where $\omega \le
2.371552\ldots$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Thus, the best known
bound is $\hat O(n^{\min \{ 2 + \sigma, \omega\}})$. Leveraging shortcut
constructions by Kogan and Parter [SODA 2022, ICALP 2022], we develop a
centralized algorithm with running time $\hat O(n^{1 + \frac{2}{3}
\omega(\sigma)})$, where $\omega(\sigma)$ is the rectangular matrix
multiplication exponent. Using current estimates on $\omega(\sigma)$, our
exponent improves upon $\min \{2 + \sigma, \omega \}$ for $\tilde \sigma \leq
\sigma \leq 0.53$, where $1/3 < \tilde \sigma < 0.3336$ is a universal
constant.
  In a classical result, Cohen [Journal of Algorithms, 1996] devised parallel
algorithms for $S \times V$ reachability on graphs admitting balanced recursive
separators of size $n^{\rho}$ for $\rho < 1$, requiring polylogarithmic time
and work $n^{\max \{\omega \rho, 2\rho + \sigma \} + o(1)}$. We significantly
improve, extend, and generalize Cohen's result. First, our parallel algorithm
for graphs with small recursive separators has lower work complexity than
Cohen's in boraod paramater ranges. Second, we generalize our algorithm to
graphs of treewidth at most $n^{\rho}$ ($\rho < 1$) and provide a centralized
algorithm that outperforms existing bounds for $S \times V$ reachability on
such graphs. We also do this for some other graph familes with small
separators. Finally, we extend these results to $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate
distance computation.

Motivation: 研究Manacher数组的结构和重建复杂性，以推进其组合理解并为结构约束下的字符串重建开辟新方向。

Method: 1. 建立组合下界；2. 引入图论框架，将Manacher数组与图关联；3. 分析重建算法。

Result: 证明了组合下界，重建算法实现了全局最小字母表大小，最多使用log2(n-1)+2个符号，并能适应任意字母表。

Conclusion: 研究结果推进了对Manacher数组的理解，并为结构约束下的字符串重建提供了新方向。

Abstract: We investigate the structure and reconstruction complexity of Manacher
arrays. First, we establish a combinatorial lower bound, proving that the
number of rooted tandem repeat trees with $n+1$ genes exceeds the number of
distinct Manacher arrays of length $n$. Second, we introduce a graph-theoretic
framework that associates a graph to each Manacher array, where every proper
vertex coloring yields a string consistent with the array. Finally, we analyze
a reconstruction algorithm by I et al. (SPIRE 2010), showing that it
simultaneously achieves a globally minimal alphabet size, uses at most
$\log_2(n{-}1) + 2$ distinct symbols, and can be adapted to produce
reconstructions over arbitrary alphabets when possible. Our results also
resolve an open problem posed by the original authors. Together, these findings
advance the combinatorial understanding of Manacher arrays and open new
directions for string reconstruction under structural constraints.

Motivation: 研究在数据样本存在相关性时，集中查询框架在自适应数据分析中的局限性，以填补独立样本与非独立样本之间的效用差距。

Method: 通过理论证明和算法简化，验证了集中查询框架在自适应设置下的固有局限性，并提出了一种匹配不可能性结果的简化算法。

Result: 证明了在当前集中查询框架下，效用差距是必然的，同时提出的简化算法与不可能性结果相匹配。

Conclusion: 集中查询框架在自适应设置中存在固有局限性，但通过简化算法可以部分弥补这一差距。

Abstract: Most work on adaptive data analysis assumes that samples in the dataset are
independent. When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can
become intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address
this, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of
concentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries
that are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes
the problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it
remains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework
support significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most
$O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the
independent setting.
  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current
formulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural
conditions on the algorithm. Additionally, we present a simplified version of
the best-known algorithms that match our impossibility result.

Result: 算法能在预期时间内找到长度不超过4k/3倍最短环的环。

Conclusion: 该算法在加权图中显著优于现有方法，尤其在k=1时改进了Roditty和Tov的结果。

Abstract: Let $G = (V,E,\ell)$ be a $n$-node $m$-edge weighted undirected graph, where
$\ell: E \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ is a real \emph{length} function defined on
its edges, and let $g$ denote the girth of $G$, i.e., the length of its
shortest cycle. We present an algorithm that, for any input, integer $k \geq
1$, in $O(kn^{1+1/k}\log{n} + m(k+\log{n}))$ expected time finds a cycle of
length at most $\frac{4k}{3}g$. This algorithm nearly matches a
$O(n^{1+1/k}\log{n})$-time algorithm of \cite{KadriaRSWZ22} which applied to
unweighted graphs of girth $3$. For weighted graphs, this result also improves
upon the previous state-of-the-art algorithm that in $O((n^{1+1/k}\log n+m)\log
(nM))$ time, where $\ell: E \rightarrow [1, M]$ is an integral length function,
finds a cycle of length at most $2kg$~\cite{KadriaRSWZ22}. For $k=1$ this

Motivation: 经典的模式匹配问题及其带通配符的变体已有高效算法，但量子计算领域尚未解决带通配符的亚线性时间问题。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用量子算法设计了一种新的解决方案，重点优化了带通配符的模式匹配问题的时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 本文证明了带通配符的模式匹配问题在量子计算中可以实现亚线性时间解决，扩展了量子算法的应用范围。

Abstract: Pattern matching is one of the fundamental problems in Computer Science. Both
the classic version of the problem as well as the more sophisticated version
where wildcards can also appear in the input can be solved in almost linear
time $\tilde O(n)$ using the KMP algorithm and Fast Fourier Transform,
respectively. In 2000, Ramesh and Vinay~\cite{ramesh2003string} give a quantum
algorithm that solves classic pattern matching in sublinear time and asked
whether the wildcard problem can also be solved in sublinear time? In this
work, we give a quantum algorithm for pattern matching with wildcards that runs
in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{n}\sqrt{k})$ when the number of wildcards is bounded by
$k$ for $k \geq \sqrt{n}$. This leads to an algorithm that runs in sublinear
time as long as the number of wildcards is sublinear.

Conclusion: 推广的拓扑堆排序算法能够高效解决多种限制排序问题，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: The classical comparison-based sorting problem asks us to find the underlying
total order of a given set of elements, where we can only access the elements
via comparisons. In this paper, we study a restricted version, where, as a
hint, a set $T$ of possible total orders is given, usually in some compressed
form.
  Recently, an algorithm called topological heapsort with optimal running time
was found for the case where $T$ is the set of topological orderings of a given
directed acyclic graph, or, equivalently, $T$ is the set of linear extensions
of a given partial order [Haeupler et al. 2024]. We show that a simple
generalization of topological heapsort is applicable to a much broader class of
restricted sorting problems, where $T$ corresponds to a given antimatroid.
  As a consequence, we obtain optimal algorithms for the following restricted
sorting problems, where the allowed total orders are restricted by: a given set
of monotone precedence formulas; the perfect elimination orders of a given
chordal graph; or the possible vertex search orders of a given connected rooted
graph.

Abstract: We initiate the study of approximation algorithms and computational barriers
for constructing sparse $\alpha$-navigable graphs [IX23, DGM+24], a core
primitive underlying recent advances in graph-based nearest neighbor search.
Given an $n$-point dataset $P$ with an associated metric $\mathsf{d}$ and a
parameter $\alpha \geq 1$, the goal is to efficiently build the sparsest graph
$G=(P, E)$ that is $\alpha$-navigable: for every distinct $s, t \in P$, there
exists an edge $(s, u) \in E$ with $\mathsf{d}(u, t) < \mathsf{d}(s,
t)/\alpha$. We consider two natural sparsity objectives: minimizing the maximum
out-degree and minimizing the total size.
  We first show a strong negative result: the slow-preprocessing version of
DiskANN (analyzed in [IX23] for low-doubling metrics) can yield solutions whose
sparsity is $\widetilde{\Omega}(n)$ times larger than optimal, even on
Euclidean instances. We then show a tight approximation-preserving equivalence
between the Sparsest Navigable Graph problem and the classic Set Cover problem,
obtaining an $O(n^3)$-time $(\ln n + 1)$-approximation algorithm, as well as
establishing NP-hardness of achieving an $o(\ln n)$-approximation. Building on
this equivalence, we develop faster $O(\ln n)$-approximation algorithms. The
first runs in $\widetilde{O}(n \cdot \mathrm{OPT})$ time and is thus much
faster when the optimal solution is sparse. The second, based on fast matrix
multiplication, is a bicriteria algorithm that computes an $O(\ln
n)$-approximation to the sparsest $2\alpha$-navigable graph, running in
$\widetilde{O}(n^{\omega})$ time.
  Finally, we complement our upper bounds with a query complexity lower bound,
showing that any $o(n)$-approximation requires examining $\Omega(n^2)$
distances. This result shows that in the regime where $\mathrm{OPT} =
\widetilde{O}(n)$, our $\widetilde{O}(n \cdot \mathrm{OPT})$-time algorithm is
essentially best possible.

Motivation: 解决$k$-means问题在大规模并行计算环境中的高效近似需求，填补现有方法在轮次复杂度上的不足。

Method: 基于Jain和Vazirani的框架，利用设施位置问题的常数因子近似（满足LMP性质），将其转化为$k$-means近似。

Conclusion: 该算法是首个在MPC模型中实现$o(\log n)$轮次的$k$-means常数因子近似方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient massively parallel approximation
algorithm for the $k$-means problem. Specifically, we provide an MPC algorithm
that computes a constant-factor approximation to an arbitrary $k$-means
instance in $O(\log\log n \cdot \log\log\log n)$ rounds. The algorithm uses
$O(n^\sigma)$ bits of memory per machine, where $\sigma > 0$ is a constant that
can be made arbitrarily small. The global memory usage is
$O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ bits for an arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon >
0$, and is thus only slightly superlinear. Recently, Czumaj, Gao, Jiang,
Krauthgamer, and Vesel\'{y} showed that a constant-factor bicriteria
approximation can be computed in $O(1)$ rounds in the MPC model. However, our
algorithm is the first constant-factor approximation for the general $k$-means
problem that runs in $o(\log n)$ rounds in the MPC model.
  Our approach builds upon the foundational framework of Jain and Vazirani. The
core component of our algorithm is a constant-factor approximation for the
related facility location problem. While such an approximation was already
achieved in constant time in the work of Czumaj et al.\ mentioned above, our
version additionally satisfies the so-called Lagrangian Multiplier Preserving
(LMP) property. This property enables the transformation of a facility location
approximation into a comparably good $k$-means approximation.

space, where $M_1$ is either $o\left(N\right)$ or the space bound for a
sequential streaming algorithm. Processors may communicate as needed.
Algorithms are assessed by the number of passes, per-item processing time,
total runtime, space usage, communication cost, and solution quality.
  We design a single-pass algorithm in this model for approximating the maximum
weight matching (MWM) problem. Given $k$ edge streams and a parameter
$\varepsilon > 0$, the algorithm computes a
$\left(2+\epsilon\right)$-approximate MWM. We analyze its performance in a
shared-memory parallel setting: for any constant $\varepsilon > 0$, it runs in
time $\widetilde{O}\left(L_{\max}+n\right)$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices and $L_{\max}$ is the maximum stream length. It supports
$O\left(1\right)$ per-edge processing time using $\widetilde{O}\left(k\cdot
n\right)$ space. We further generalize the design to hierarchical
architectures, in which $k$ processors are partitioned into $r$ groups, each
with its own shared local memory. The total intergroup communication is
$\widetilde{O}\left(r \cdot n\right)$ bits, while all other performance
guarantees are preserved.
  We evaluate the algorithm on a shared-memory system using graphs with
trillions of edges. It achieves substantial speedups as $k$ increases and
produces matchings with weights significantly exceeding the theoretical
guarantee. On our largest test graph, it reduces runtime by nearly two orders
of magnitude and memory usage by five orders of magnitude compared to an
offline algorithm.

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种更自然的证明方法，并改进了现有结果，为交互式通信复杂度研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: There is a close relationship between the communication complexity and
information complexity of communication problems, as demonstrated by results
such as Shannon's noiseless source coding theorem, and the Slepian-Wolf
theorem. Here, we study this relationship in the prior-free and interactive
setting, where we provide an alternate proof for the result of Braverman [SIAM
Review, vol. 59, no. 4, 2017], that the amortized communication complexity of
simulating a prior-free interactive communication protocol, is equal to its
prior-free information cost. While this is a known result, our approach
addresses the need for a more natural proof of it. We also improve on the
result by achieving round preservation, and using a bounded quantity of shared
randomness. We do this by showing that the communicating parties can produce a
reliable estimate of the joint type, or empirical distribution, of their
inputs. This estimate is then used in our protocol for the prior-free reverse
Shannon theorem with side information at the receiver. These results are then
generalized to the interactive setting to obtain our main result.

Result: 结果表明，模型复杂性的方差在损失-复杂度权衡处达到峰值，类似于相变。线性回归和树模型的实验验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 结论是框架成功揭示了模型复杂性、泛化能力和过拟合阈值之间的相互作用，为信息论与统计力学的交叉研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function
$h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We
establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and
statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free
energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the
structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis
kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic
scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is
shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase
transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models
verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay
between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

Result: 成功实现了基于Sidon集的双循环码到Wozencraft码的高效转换，并验证了其解码效率的保持。

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于Sidon集的双循环码可以高效转换为Wozencraft码，而基于循环码的转换则存在限制。

Abstract: We present efficient decoding algorithms from square-root errors for two
known families of double-circulant codes: A construction based on Sidon sets
(Bhargava, Taveres, and Shiva, \emph{IEEE IT 74}; Calderbank, \emph{IEEE IT
83}; Guruswami and Li, \emph{IEEE IT 2025}), and a construction based on cyclic
codes (Chen, Peterson, and Weldon, \emph{Information and Control 1969}). We
further observe that the work of Guruswami and Li implicitly gives a
transformation from double-circulant codes of certain block lengths to
Wozencraft codes which preserves that distance of the codes, and we show that
this transformation also preserves efficiency of decoding. By instantiating
this transformation with the first family of double-circulant codes based on
Sidon sets, we obtain an explicit construction of a Wozencraft code that is
efficiently decodable from square-root errors. We also discuss limitations on
instantiating this transformation with the second family of double-circulant
codes based on cyclic codes.

Abstract: The substring edit error is the operation of replacing a substring $u$ of $x$

substitutions within a window. Codes correcting one substring edit have
redundancy at least $\log n+k$. In this paper, we construct codes correcting
one substring edit with redundancy $\log n+O(\log \log n)$, which is
asymptotically optimal.

Result: 数值结果表明，所提方案在特定内存区域中优于基线方案。

Conclusion: 提出的保密方案在热插拔编码缓存中有效，且在某些情况下性能更优。

Abstract: In this work, we consider a coded caching model called \textit{hotplug coded
caching}, in which some users are offline during the delivery phase. The
concept of Hotplug Placement Delivery Arrays (HpPDAs) for hotplug coded caching
systems has been introduced in the literature, and two classes of HpPDAs are
known. In this paper, we consider a secrecy constraint in hotplug coded caching
setup, where users should not learn anything about any file from their cache
content, and active users should not gain any information about files other
than their demanded file from either their cache content or the server
transmissions. We propose two secretive schemes for the two classes of HpPDAs
and compare them with a baseline scheme, which is a secretive scheme using PDAs
for the classical coded caching setup and can be trivially adapted for the
hotplug coded caching setup. We numerically show that our schemes outperform
the baseline scheme in certain memory regions.

Motivation: 有害组合结构影响解码性能，需找到消除这些结构的条件和方法。

Method: 结合Clique Lovász局部引理和Moser-Tardos算法，分析LLL和M-T分布特性，建立有害结构间的依赖关系。

Result: 给出消除有害结构后剩余结构概率变化的上界，例如消除4-cycles会使6-cycles活跃概率最多增加e^(8/3)倍。

Conclusion: 论文提供了理论条件和构造性方法，有效改善SC码的解码性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Clique Lov\'asz Local Lemma to provide sufficient
conditions on memory and lifting degree for removing certain harmful
combinatorial structures in spatially-coupled (SC) codes that negatively impact
decoding performance. Additionally, we present, for the first time, a
constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures
predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of
LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the
harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on
the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some
of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability
of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的同步错误通常以突发形式出现，因此需要研究分段突发删除信道。

Result: 所提出的编码方法实现了冗余度为O(log b)。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了分段突发删除信道中的纠错问题。

Abstract: We study segmented burst-deletion channels motivated by the observation that
synchronization errors commonly occur in a bursty manner in real-world
settings. In this channel model, transmitted sequences are implicitly divided
into non-overlapping segments, each of which may experience at most one burst
of deletions. In this paper, we develop error correction codes for segmented
burst-deletion channels over arbitrary alphabets under the assumption that each
segment may contain only one burst of t-deletions. The main idea is to encode
the input subsequence corresponding to each segment using existing one-burst
deletion codes, with additional constraints that enable the decoder to identify
segment boundaries during the decoding process from the received sequence. The
resulting codes achieve redundancy that scales as O(log b), where b is the
length of each segment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据准备是机器学习生命周期中基础但复杂的环节，现有强化学习方法效率低下，未能捕捉问题的层次结构。

Method: 提出CogniQ-H框架，采用软层次强化学习，结合LLM的战略先验、LTR模型的质量评分和Q函数的价值估计。

Result: 在18个数据集上，CogniQ-H比现有RL方法提升13.9%的流程质量，收敛速度快2.8倍。

Conclusion: 软层次强化学习框架CogniQ-H为自动化数据准备提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of
the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search
space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers
a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to
capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful
in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored
framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard
hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we
introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical
paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates
action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior,
generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration
probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained
operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a
long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid
architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive,
evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse
datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to
13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence
compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

Method: LLaPipe引入三个创新：LLM策略顾问、经验蒸馏机制和自适应顾问触发策略，结合LLMs的语义分析和历史管道经验。

Result: 在18个数据集上的实验表明，LLaPipe在管道质量和收敛速度上显著优于现有RL方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: LLaPipe通过智能LLM干预，有效提升了数据预处理管道的探索效率和质量。

Abstract: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet
existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient
exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present
LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike
traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind
trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes
dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing
operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful
patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future
exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy
(Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention
is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational
cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple
domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in
pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to
state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency
through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).

Abstract: This study explored the development of a novel self-healing framework for

primary objective was to address the challenges of real-time adaptability and
minimal retraining in dynamic workload environments. The proposed approach
integrated Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with reinforcement learning to
enable anomaly detection and corrective actions that adapted swiftly to
evolving database conditions. Multi-objective optimization was employed to
balance performance, resource utilization, and cost efficiency during the
healing process. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were incorporated to model
interdependencies within database components, ensuring holistic recovery
strategies. Data efficiency was enhanced through synthetic task augmentation
and self-supervised learning, enabling effective training in sparse data
regimes. To promote trust and transparency, explainable AI techniques were
integrated to provide interpretable insights into anomaly detection and healing
actions. Federated meta-learning further enabled privacy-preserving
adaptability in distributed database environments. The framework demonstrated
significant improvements in adaptability, efficiency, and reliability,
contributing to advancements in database management and self-healing systems.

Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are a widespread way to provide high-quality data
for all kinds of data science applications. However, numerous challenges still
remain in the composition and operation of such pipelines. Data engineering
pipelines do not always deliver high-quality data. By default, they are also
not reactive to changes. When new data is coming in which deviates from prior
data, the pipeline could crash or output undesired results. We therefore
envision three levels of next generation data engineering pipelines: optimized
data pipelines, self-aware data pipelines, and self-adapting data pipelines.
Pipeline optimization addresses the composition of operators and their
parametrization in order to achieve the highest possible data quality.
Self-aware data engineering pipelines enable a continuous monitoring of its
current state, notifying data engineers on significant changes. Self-adapting
data engineering pipelines are then even able to automatically react to those
changes. We propose approaches to achieve each of these levels.

Motivation: 旨在统一并简化半环聚合查询、枚举和计数查询的复杂性分析，提供更直观的算法处理方式。

Result: 证明了该方法能够解释现有的查询枚举、计数和半环聚合查询的易处理性结果，并恢复了相关复杂性边界。

Conclusion: 'project-connex'树宽度为半环聚合查询的复杂性分析提供了统一框架，并验证了其与经典树分解算法的关联。

Abstract: We introduce 'project-connex' tree-width as a measure of tractability for
counting and aggregate conjunctive queries over semirings with 'group-by'
projection (also known as 'AJAR' or 'FAQ' queries). This elementary measure
allows to obtain comparable complexity bounds to the ones obtained by previous
structural conditions tailored for efficient evaluation of semiring aggregate
queries, enumeration algorithms of conjunctive queries, and tractability of
counting answers to conjunctive queries.
  Project-connex tree decompositions are defined as the natural extension of
the known notion of 'free-connex' decompositions. They allow for a unified,
simple and intuitive algorithmic manipulation for evaluation of aggregate
queries and explain some existing tractability results on conjunctive query
enumeration, counting conjunctive query evaluation, and evaluation of semiring
aggregate queries. Using this measure we also recover results relating
tractable classes of counting conjunctive queries and bounded free-connex
tree-width, or the constant-time delay enumeration of semiring aggregate
queries over bounded project-connex classes. We further show that
project-connex tree decompositions can be obtained via algorithms for computing
classical tree decompositions.
