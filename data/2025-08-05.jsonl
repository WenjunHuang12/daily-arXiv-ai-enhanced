These\nservices are effectively lightweight databases optimized for low-volume\nmetadata. As the control plane scales in the cloud, this approach faces similar\nlimitations as converged databases did before storage disaggregation:\nscalability bottlenecks, low cost efficiency, and increased operational burden.\n  We propose to disaggregate the cluster coordination to achieve the same\nbenefits that storage disaggregation brought to modern cloud DBMSs. We present\nMarlin, a cloud-native coordination mechanism that fully embraces storage\ndisaggregation. Marlin eliminates the need for external coordination services\nby consolidating coordination functionality into the existing cloud-native\ndatabase it manages. To achieve failover without an external coordination\nservice, Marlin allows cross-node modifications on coordination states. To\nensure data consistency, Marlin employs transactions to manage both\ncoordination and application states and introduces MarlinCommit, an optimized\ncommit protocol that ensures strong transactional guarantees even under\ncross-node modifications. Our evaluations demonstrate that Marlin improves cost\nefficiency by up to 4.4x and reduces reconfiguration duration by up to 4.9x\ncompared to converged coordination solutions."}

However, obtaining multimodal\nrepresentations for items relies on complex pre-trained encoders, which incurs\nunacceptable computation cost to train jointly with downstream ranking models.\nTherefore, it is important to maintain alignment between semantic and behavior\nspace in a lightweight way.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic-Behavior Alignment for\nCold-start Recommendation framework, which mainly focuses on utilizing\nmultimodal representations that align with the user behavior space to predict\nCTR. First, we leverage domain-specific knowledge to train a multimodal encoder\nto generate behavior-aware semantic representations. Second, we use residual\nquantized semantic ID to dynamically bridge the gap between multimodal\nrepresentations and the ranking model, facilitating the continuous\nsemantic-behavior alignment.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a\nbidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical\nqueries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional\nrelevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces\ntwo query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from\nmulti-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate\nstructured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from\nintra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial\nelements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and\nprompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance\nannotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the\ngeneration relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method\nto enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed\na Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k\nChinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and\nrich relevance labels.

One of their prominent applications\nin traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky\ndriving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows\nand static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -\nlimiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world\ndriving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for\nidentifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.\nThe approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to\ndynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing\nsubtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and\nharsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random\nForest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong\ncapability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly\nexcelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk\ndetection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across\ndifferent thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more\nvariability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which\nmay be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway\nemerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh\ndriving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual\nvariation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised\nrisk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring\ndriver support in intelligent transport systems."}

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)\nframework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.\nThe key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning\nprocess by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with\nstronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.\nSpecifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or\nlocal knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we\nemploy Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of\nreasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the\nincorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire\nthe capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long\ncontexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly\nimproves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts\nin long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains."}

Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans.

In this work, we identify a subtler\nfailure mode that arises \\textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all\nagents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of\ntrajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint\ndata distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.\nThis \\textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces\ninaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In\nthis paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through\ncoordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of\npolicy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive\naction sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,\nMulti-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized\nbehavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint\nactions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We\nempirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and\ndemonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently\nthan standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of\nindependent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training\nruns that converge to an optimal joint policy."}

In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware\nSystem (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this\nlimitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major\ninternational stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,\nsignificantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining\ncompetitive returns."}

Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and\ntemporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory\nare present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits\ninformation-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through\ncontrolled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either\nenvironmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).\nSurprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not\nalways prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the\npseudo-Thompson Sampling effect.

We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe\ncompletions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central\nto our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic\ninconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved\ntraining documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary\ninterventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses\ncompletions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a\ncontrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,\nand (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam\nexpansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce\nalignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)\nwhile preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and\nimproved refusal quality.

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware\nfederated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models\nbuilt upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,\npreserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students\non each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the\nstudents in each client based on its local student learning data, and each\nclient uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter\naggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The\nmain idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the\nfirst is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic\nfunction-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;\nthe second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,\ncontaining exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware\naggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness.

We introduce a trainable dynamic mask\nsparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes\ncontent-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key\ninnovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from\nvalue representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical\ninformation adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention\ncomputation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head\nattention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native\nsparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.\nMoreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also\ndemonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.\nCrucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly\noutperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the\nchallenging needle-in-a-haystack task.

Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response\nlength, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the\nreasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it\ninto two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of\nlow-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and\nexternal redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To\nmitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning\nframework.

First, we introduce\nthe Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph\n(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational\ntriples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates\nreal-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven\nextraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured\nand accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a\nTwo-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the\nretrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and\nprecise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG\nachieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs\nby 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting."}

While fusing multiple domains often\npresumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can\nyield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To\nvalidate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and\nrigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for\ntime-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal\n(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,\n2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian\ninference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline\nacross all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming\nthe synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.\nConversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further\nimprovement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational\nredundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.\nThis research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in\nbiomedical signal analysis.

To develop a unified inference algorithm for\nboth automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that\nsubsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata\nlearning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly\nreductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques\nand identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.\nExperimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of\nmagnitude over SOTA baselines."}

To evade\ndetection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes\nvariability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments\non three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,\ncompared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion\nwhile remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are\nmore vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for\nmore robust defenses."}

To predict the risk of large trucks merging into\na mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nneural network is employed.

We present a novel defence method against\ntargeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called\nLinear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as\nclustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious\nnodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a\nlinear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.\nThis method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear\ncombinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out\nredundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established\ndefence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks\nfrom both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments\nconfirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application\nsettings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated\nlearning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to\nbaseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for\nmalicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it\npreserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and\n0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the\nreliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data\npoisoning attacks."}

The proposed MPFT framework\nincludes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,\nwhose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.\nStage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,\nstarting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse\nregions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight\nadjustment method to fill the sparse regions.

Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory\ncomputing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images\nneed to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR\nenergy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system\nwith a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge\ndevices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free\nnear-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization\nissues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The\nexperimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy."}

The\nresulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.\nTo better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines\nthe MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the\nquestion-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA\ndynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both\nthe question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,\nwhich encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal\ndependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning\nprocess. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly\nimproves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our\nexperiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms\nunstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal\nrelationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations\nalone."}

This creates a critical limitation:\nagents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic\nplanners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce\nHealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a\nnovel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own\nhigh-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and\nfailures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and\nfacilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark\nfeaturing complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from\npeer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nHealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nagent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better\ntool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way\nfor more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery."}

Actionability is defined as the ability to\ntransform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We\ndevelop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike\npredecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only\nused to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to\napply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous\ndata, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the\ndata density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced\ninterpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is\nraising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our\nproposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current\nstate-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world\nEnvironmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and\nequitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of\nAmerica counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring\nequity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,\nwater quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the\nsociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables\nrelated to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe\nnegative impact on communities."}

This\nquestion has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,\nby now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of\ninterest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a\nprespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.\n  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity\ntracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity\n(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be\ncompetitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in\nhindsight. Our main contribution is a\n$\\operatorname{polylog}(\\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking\nalgorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on\nPoisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest."}
