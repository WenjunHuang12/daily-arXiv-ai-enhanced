We investigate the existence of allocations satisfying\nthe popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX), and its\nmultiplicative approximations. The existence of $4$-EFX allocations was\nrecently established by Garg, Murhekar, and Qin (2025). We improve this\nguarantee by proving the existence of $2$-EFX allocations for all instances\nwith additive disutilities. This approximation was previously known only for\nrestricted instances such as bivalued disutilities (Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2025))\nor three agents (Afshinmehr, Ansaripour, Danaei, and Mehlhorn (2024)).\n  We obtain our result by providing a general framework for achieving\napproximate-EFX allocations. The approach begins with a suitable initial\nallocation and performs a sequence of local swaps between the bundles of\nenvious and envied agents. For our main result, we begin with an initial\nallocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and\nPareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently\nestablished in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate\nthe strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified\nproofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii)\n2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice\nthe number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances.

In practical deployments,\nthe control of RIS phase states is typically managed using finite codebooks,\nwith configuration indices transmitted over low latency, yet imperfect,\nwireless feedback channels. Even rare feedback bit errors can lead to\nsignificant mismatches between intended and applied RIS states, degrading\nsystem performance. This paper addresses the challenge of robust RIS codebook\nindex assignment by formulating it as a combinatorial optimization problem,\nequivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where codewords are\n\"cities\" and edge weights reflect SNR degradation under codeword confusion.

In the budget minimization version, the goal\nis to minimize the total cost of the removed edges, while achieving a desired\nincrease $\\Delta$ in the weight of the minimum spanning tree. An alternative\nobjective within the same framework is to maximize the profit of interdiction,\nnamely the increase in the weight of the minimum spanning tree, subject to a\nbudget constraint. There are known polynomial time $O(1)$ approximation\nguarantees for a similar objective (maximizing the total cost of the tree,\nrather than the increase). However, the guarantee does not seem to apply to the\nincrease in cost. Moreover, the same techniques do not seem to apply to the\nbudget version.\n  Our approximation guarantees are motivated by studying the question of\nminimizing the cost of increasing the minimum spanning tree by any amount.

However, these documents are often lengthy,\nstructurally diverse, and multimodal, comprising dense text, structured tables,\ncomplex figures, and layout-dependent semantics. Existing AI systems often\nstruggle to perform reliable document-level reasoning in such settings, and no\ndedicated benchmark currently exists in ESG domain. To fill the gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{MMESGBench}, a first-of-its-kind benchmark dataset targeted\nto evaluate multimodal understanding and complex reasoning across structurally\ndiverse and multi-source ESG documents. This dataset is constructed via a\nhuman-AI collaborative, multi-stage pipeline. First, a multimodal LLM generates\ncandidate question-answer (QA) pairs by jointly interpreting rich textual,\ntabular, and visual information from layout-aware document pages. Second, an\nLLM verifies the semantic accuracy, completeness, and reasoning complexity of\neach QA pair. This automated process is followed by an expert-in-the-loop\nvalidation, where domain specialists validate and calibrate QA pairs to ensure\nquality, relevance, and diversity. MMESGBench comprises 933 validated QA pairs\nderived from 45 ESG documents, spanning across seven distinct document types\nand three major ESG source categories. Questions are categorized as\nsingle-page, cross-page, or unanswerable, with each accompanied by fine-grained\nmultimodal evidence.

While Autoregressive\nCompression Models (ACMs) have markedly improved compression efficiency through\nprobabilistic prediction, current approaches remain constrained by two critical\nlimitations: suboptimal compression ratios due to insufficient fine-grained\nfeature extraction during probability modeling, and real-time processing\nbottlenecks caused by high resource consumption and low compression speeds. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Efficient Dual-path Parallel Compression\n(EDPC), a hierarchically optimized compression framework that synergistically\nenhances modeling capability and execution efficiency via coordinated dual-path\noperations. At the modeling level, we introduce the Information Flow Refinement\n(IFR) metric grounded in mutual information theory, and design a Multi-path\nByte Refinement Block (MBRB) to strengthen cross-byte dependency modeling via\nheterogeneous feature propagation. At the system level, we develop a Latent\nTransformation Engine (LTE) for compact high-dimensional feature representation\nand a Decoupled Pipeline Compression Architecture (DPCA) to eliminate\nencoding-decoding latency through pipelined parallelization.

This problem is of central importance to algorithms across scientific\ncomputing and machine learning, with applications to fast multiplication and\ninversion for structured matrices, building preconditioners for first-order\noptimization, and as a model for differential operator learning. Prior work\nfocuses on obtaining query complexity upper and lower bounds for learning\nspecific structured matrix families that commonly arise in applications.\n  We initiate the study of the problem in greater generality, aiming to\nunderstand the query complexity of learning approximations from general matrix\nfamilies. Our main result focuses on finding a near-optimal approximation to\n$A$ from any finite-sized family of matrices, $\\mathcal{F}$. Standard results\nfrom matrix sketching show that $O(\\log|\\mathcal{F}|)$ matvec queries suffice\nin this setting. This bound can also be achieved, and is optimal, for\nvector-matrix-vector queries of the form $x,y\\rightarrow x^TAy$, which have\nbeen widely studied in work on rank-$1$ matrix sensing.\n  Surprisingly, we show that, in the matvec model, it is possible to obtain a\nnearly quadratic improvement in complexity, to\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\log|\\mathcal{F}|})$. Further, we prove that this bound is\ntight up to log-log factors.Via covering number arguments, our result extends\nto well-studied infinite families. As an example, we establish that a\nnear-optimal approximation from any \\emph{linear matrix family} of dimension\n$q$ can be learned with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{q})$ matvec queries, improving on an\n$O(q)$ bound achievable via sketching techniques and vector-matrix-vector\nqueries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u77e5\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u79e9\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5e26\u72b6\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\u4e2d\u63a2\u8ba8\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6838\u5fc3\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5feb\u901f\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u9006\u8fd0\u7b97\u3001\u6784\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u65e0\u9650\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd1\u4e8c\u6b21\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4eceO(log|F|)\u964d\u81f3~O(\u221alog|F|)\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u754c\u9650\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(q)\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3a~O(\u221aq)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u65cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Each DARISA comprises a number of metasurface elements activated\nsimultaneously via a parallel feed network. The proposed system enables rapid\nand intelligent phase response adjustments for each metasurface element within\na single symbol duration, facilitating a dynamic agile adjustment of phase\nresponse (DAAPR) strategy. By analyzing the theoretical degrees of freedom\n(DoF) of the DARISA MIMO system under the DAAPR framework, we derive an\nexplicit relationship between DoF and critical system parameters, including\nagility frequentness (i.e., the number of phase adjustments of metasurface\nelements during one symbol period), cluster angular spread of wireless\nchannels, DARISA array size, and the number of transmit/receive DARISAs. The\nDoF result reveals a significant conclusion: when the number of receive DARISAs\nis smaller than that of transmit DARISAs, the DAAPR strategy of the DARISA MIMO\nenhances the overall system DoF. Furthermore, relying on DoF alone to measure\nchannel capacity is insufficient, so we analyze the effective DoF (EDoF) that\nreflects the impacts of the DoF and channel matrix singular value distribution\non capacity.

Effectively querying this data is essential\nto enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying\nby defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each\naligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on\nindexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide\naccurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,\nstate-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object\ncounts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this\nlimitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for\naccurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing\non accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding\nobject centers to improve counting accuracy.

The corresponding information theoretic model for\nthe uplink (from the wireless users to the CP) is a multiaccess-relay channel\nwith primitive oblivious relays. The relays (RUs) are oblivious, as they are\nagnostic of the users codebooks, and primitive, since the fronthaul links (from\nRUs to CP) are error-free with limited capacity.

This research explores how RL,\nparticularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop\nautonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.\n  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning\nproblem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and\nmulti-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then\naddresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary\napproaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning\n(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the\nlatter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing\nobjectives.\n  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,\na novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This\nmethod allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,\nenabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.\n  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches\nsignificantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across\nvarious performance metrics.

PBiLoss augments traditional\ntraining objectives by penalizing the model's inclination toward popular items,\nthereby encouraging the recommendation of less popular but potentially more\npersonalized content. We introduce two sampling strategies: Popular Positive\n(PopPos) and Popular Negative (PopNeg), which respectively modulate the\ncontribution of the positive and negative popular items during training. We\nfurther explore two methods to distinguish popular items: one based on a fixed\npopularity threshold and another without any threshold, making the approach\nflexible and adaptive.

Motivated by the\nobservation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology\n``un-pruning\" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning.

We\nvalidate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the\nretriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA\ndatasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG\nperformance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,\nwhere the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,\nwhere it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently\nimproves robustness.

While existing research on GNN\nrobustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced\nfaults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress\ntoward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency\ndemands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can\ncause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major\ntechnology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a\ncomprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to\nreveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and\nefficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and\nlightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.\nSpecifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out\noutliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these\nprotective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any\nmessage-passing GNNs.

Accepted as a spotlight poster at ICML 2025", "summary": "The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the \"Fisher diagonal\")\nhas frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,\nthe Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's\nlikelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or\nthousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs.

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse\nfinite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep\nlearning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape\ndirectly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating\nbiophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with\nphysiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and\nfiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts\na graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to\nenable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial\nself-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training\ndatasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV\ngeometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter\naccuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing\ninference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and\nsignificantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation\nstudies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the\ncycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as\nfew as 200 training samples.

Previous ML\nmodels typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a\ntrained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed\nReynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of\nPDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of\nscales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more\nconcretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters\nand the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to\nrepresent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given\ndomain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a\nscale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a\ngiven domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.\nSince neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the\nnatural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of\nneural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the\nscale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,\nHelmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Traditional deep learning models, such\nas long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle\nto generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a\nmore adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce\nKolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes\n(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse\nspline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework\nidentifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,\nenabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs\nKolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate\nprice behaviors while maintaining robustness.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the\nentire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to\nestimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road\nregion. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the\nexisting binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.\nTherefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture\nthat denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask\nrepresentations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.\nWe evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and\nCARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal\nnavigable corridors in the image.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u9a7e\u9a76\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d70\u5eca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eBEV\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff1b\u800c\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d70\u5eca\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u8f66\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ContourDiff\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u8f6e\u5ed3\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u4e8c\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cCARLA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bfc\u822a\u8d70\u5eca\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d70\u5eca\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Conventional\ndesign flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are\nlimited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this\npaper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the\nautomatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically\nmultipliers.\n  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two\nstages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised\nfinetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area\nfrom abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,\nGENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize\npower consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.\nExtensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently\nmore sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards\noptimized designs.

This task is notably challenging due to\nthe absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit\nsimilar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing\nmethods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but\nthey commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require\nlarge amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage\nframework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM\nmodel for word reconstruction to address these challenges.

While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm.

The reservoir network\nis constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data\nsequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid\nexpensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is\ndirectly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.\nWe assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical\nnonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.\nCompared to an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and\ncomparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent\nperformance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff08DyRC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u8fc7\u5927\u7f51\u7edc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u56fe\uff08VG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684VG\u7f51\u7edc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u50a8\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027Duffing\u632f\u8361\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDyRC-VG\u6bd4\u76f8\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi\u56fe\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DyRC-VG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u50a8\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An ideal agnostic biosignature must be\ninterpretable and experimentally measurable.

First, it is interpretable for\nlife detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as\nbuilding blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.\nSecond, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be\nphysically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from\nother approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular\ncomplexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass\nspectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address\nthis, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly\nwith high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.\nSimulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double\nmodel error, emphasizing the need for standardization.

Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video.

This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that\ndeviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement\nand scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we\npropose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to\ndistribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their\ndominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric\nalignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view\nnormal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both\nlocal and global perspectives.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance.

While these parameters are crucial, they only\ncover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored\nonly if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition\nmonitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques\nsuch as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition\nmonitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for\nfault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially\nintroduced faults in laboratory settings.

This study\nevaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches\nYOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image\ndataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained\nconditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)\napproach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To\nconduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each\nof the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.\nThe models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to\n1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by\nvarying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,\nand 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and\ncolour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use\nMVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings\nindicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed\nclassification-only models in make and shape extraction.

Third, and most centrally, we\nprove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive\nlearning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,\nwe show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align\nwith the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a\ngeometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This\ncompositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural\nprinciples underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:\nhttps://github.com/asiresearch/lm-theory", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8303\u7574\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u8d1f\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\uff08NLL\uff09\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f55\u7b80\u5355\u7684NLL\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8303\u7574\uff08MCs\uff09\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6563\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982EAGLE\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5197\u4f59\u5229\u7528\uff0cNLL\u8bad\u7ec3\u9690\u542b\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eNLL\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u5f0f\u8c31\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "NLL\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u76f8\u4f3c\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently\nunify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point\ncloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete\npoint cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

In\nmedical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,\nraising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual\nexplanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by\npresenting hypothetical \"what-if\" scenarios that alter model classifications.\nBy examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns\nthat influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating\nplausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing\nhuman-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we\ninvestigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While\ndeep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit\nsignificant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks\n(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By\nmodeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we\nleverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a\ngiven discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent\nspace counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and\naligned with the target class distribution.

In medicine, these models can admit\nconflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly\nunderstood and insufficiently addressed.\n  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications\nof predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model\narchitectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate\npredictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard\nvalidation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a\nsubstantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model\ndevelopment.

However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms.

An\nadditional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV\nmapping and polar coordinate indexing.

Specifically, many\nreal-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or\nnon-existent, \\eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific\nconditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale\ntraining, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.\nTo address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the\nscarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive\ndata containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions\ndemand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable\nwidespread adoption.

Additionally, the unprecedented success\nof recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that\ntechnology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been\ndeveloped. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the\ntime is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level\nevent forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training\nmethods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three\ndifficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,\nknowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present\nrelated ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,\nutilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward\nsignals.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

Through the lens of these circuits, we\ndiscover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object\ntokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.\nFurthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions\nemerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.\nIn contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we\nreveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional\nlocalization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant\nmechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a\nfoundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5177\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9LVLMs\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7535\u8def\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7535\u8def\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d41\u7535\u8def\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790LVLMs\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u8bb0\uff08\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u8fbe92.6%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6982\u5ff5\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLVLMs\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While universal lesion\nsegmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time\npoints. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model\nin a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and\nfollow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track\nlesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a\nsharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan\nregistration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence\nprocess. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled\nexperiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the\ntrue lesion center.

However, identifying\n3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite\nexplicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud\nbackbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to\nadequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the\ndisparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects.

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u6210\u5206\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6574\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u5934\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u53ef\u8868\u8fbe\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
