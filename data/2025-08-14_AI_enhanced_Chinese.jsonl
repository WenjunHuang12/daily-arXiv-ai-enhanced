In this paper, we\nstudy how carbon pricing can be used to guide traffic towards equilibria that\nrespect given emission budgets. In particular, we consider a general\nmulti-commodity flow model with flow-dependent externalities. These\nexternalities may represent carbon emissions, entering a priced area, or the\ntraversal of paths regulated by tradable credit schemes.\n  We provide a complete characterization of all flows that can be attained as\nWardrop equilibria when assigning a single price to each externality. More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program. In the case of a single externality, we prove that the\ntotal externality caused by the traffic flow is decreasing in the price. For\nincreasing, continuous, and piecewise affine travel time functions with a\nsingle externality, we give an output-polynomial algorithm that computes all\nequilibria implementable by pricing the externality. Even though there are\nnetworks where the output size is exponential in the input size, we show that\nthe minimal price obeying a given budget can be computed in polynomial time.\nThis allows the efficient computation of the market price of tradable credit\nschemes.

In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base.

Existing heuristic-based methods and neural network-based methods\nsuffer from low accuracy problems due to the reliance on handcrafted heuristics\nor specific log patterns in training sets. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have shown great potential in log template generation.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose LLMLog, a multi-round annotation framework with adaptive\nin-context learning.

Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a\nrange of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval\nand recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically\nselected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that\nemulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By\nforegrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI\nBlob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to\narchival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction\nand cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media\nhistoriography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual\nframework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary\nexperimentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI Blob! \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u76ee\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7535\u89c6\u6863\u6848\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u4e49\u6280\u672f\u548cLLMs\u5728\u7535\u89c6\u6863\u6848\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5a92\u4f53\u53f2\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u6863\u6848\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ASR\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7535\u89c6\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6c\u5f55\u3001\u5206\u6bb5\u548c\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u8bbd\u523a\u6027\u5e76\u7f6e\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u8499\u592a\u5947\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6863\u6848\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AI Blob! \u4e3a\u6863\u6848\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53d9\u4e8b\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002"}}

However, effectively exploiting\nmultimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to\nsubstantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation\nremain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal\nFusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential\nrecommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal\nFusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and\nis trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)\ncross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for\nrecommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and\npreventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional\nregularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item\nrepresentations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse\nAttention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences\nvia a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed\nattention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user\ninterests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models\nboth the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block\nvariations, producing robust user and item representations. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world benchmarks show that MUFASA consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

To\nevaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received\nsignal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of\nsurfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a\nposition-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results\ndemonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant\nadvantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two\nconfigurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a\nmultiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics\northogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the\nradiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design\nprocess more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the\nobjective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing\nthe active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients,\nsubject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the\nresulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm\nthat alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active\nbeamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the\nspherical harmonics coefficients.

Such\ndistinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible\nto traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple,\nrecommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects\nhigh-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an\noff-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip\ninto a rich natural-language description (e.g. \"a superhero parody with\nslapstick fights and orchestral stabs\"), bridging the gap between raw content\nand user intent.

To mitigate the resulting\ninterference, we propose a soft iterative detection algorithm and a\nlow-complexity implementation approach that leverages the distribution\ncharacteristics of ICI. {Simulation results demonstrate that 1) in terms of bit\nerror rate (BER), the proposed nAFDM can achieve near identical BER compared to\nconventional AFDM, while outperforms other waveform counterparts; 2) nAFDM is\ncapable of striking higher SE compared to other existing waveforms; and 3) the\nproposed nAFDM achieves an attractive BER vs. SE trade-off, and the proposed\nsoft ID scheme can attain a trade-off between BER and complexity.}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u4eff\u5c04\u9891\u5206\u590d\u7528\uff08nAFDM\uff09\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u7f29\u56e0\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eIDFT\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793anAFDM\u5728BER\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u6b63\u4ea4\u8c03\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u5bbd\u538b\u7f29\u56e0\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u8f7d\u6ce2\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eIDFT\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u8fed\u4ee3\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "nAFDM\u5728BER\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4AFDM\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0BER\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "nAFDM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, SHAP values are usually treated as point\nestimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in\npredictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric\nand epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise\nin the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In\nthis work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values\ninto aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach\nintegrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via\nDirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three\nreal-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight\ninto the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The\nexperimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the\nreliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding\ncan guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the\nrefinement of models in high-stakes applications.

Existing methods either address unobserved\nconfounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback\nbut under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer\neffect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning\nframework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an\ninstrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback\nand unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and\nhigh-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to\ndisentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the\nsimultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct\nvalid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on\nthese IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the\nunobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network\naugmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as\na control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no\nresidual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in\ncapturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances\nthe effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and\nhidden confounders.

Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset\nreveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the\neffectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system\n(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system\nachieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA\nleaderboard.

However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of\nnumerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros\nminimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as\nVariational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\napproaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population\nsynthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range\nof metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and\ndiversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms\nprevious approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and\ndiversity of the synthesized population.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0b\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u6210\u91c7\u6837\u96f6\u70b9\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u96f6\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u53e3\u5408\u6210\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5c5e\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eVAE\u548cGAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, none of the existing\nopen-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of\nsimilar size.

In this way, the vanilla dLLMs\nare refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.\nD2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on\npre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,\nwhich enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy.

Our extensive empirical analyses show that most\ngraph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various\nextents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of\nmitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and\nmethod. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node\nclassification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and\nperformance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes.

Hardware-aware latency\nmodels are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.\nAfter the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ\nmodels to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal\naccuracy drops.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMiCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\uff08MPQ\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4ecePyTorch\u5230\u88f8\u673aC\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MPQ\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0cMiCo\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u641c\u7d22\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "MiCo\u4e3aMPQ\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal\nGraph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack\ndetection in public infrastructure systems.

First, it learns causal\ninvariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under \"Normal\"\nand \"Attack\" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs\nstructural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by\nevaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging\ncausal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in\nnon-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional\nmachine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile\nsensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher\nprecision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving\nresilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift.

We then explore their synergy with foundation models and\ndigital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.\nFinally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient\ntraining, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.\nThis survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for\nrealizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGI\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u57fa\u7840\uff08\u5982\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728EGI\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u534f\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u662fEGI\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Unlike standard approaches that assume\nsigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions\n(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses\nGaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model\nany melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through\nkernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing\nproteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,\nsuch as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,\nwhere conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to\ntheir statistical constraints.

However, existing methods\noften evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the\nexponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative\nmodeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage\narchitecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse\nset of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with\nreinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine\nits selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a\nmulti-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as\nclicks, to the individual creative elements.

In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize\nsmall, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured\nknowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a\nbiologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of\ntask-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller\nchild model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform\nimitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance\nmechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage\nprocess of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional\ncarriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated\ncomponents: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention\n(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,\nensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision\ntasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),\nand semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves\nchild model performance while preserving its compactness.

Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise.

However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a\nsparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make\npredictions, significantly reducing the computation time.
