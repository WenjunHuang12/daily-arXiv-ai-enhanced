Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency\nrefinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of\nknowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and\nCARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied\ninstruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and\ntypes, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal\nsuccess rate and execution efficiency."}

This also\nmeans that spatial diversity can be exploited in an unconventional way.\nHowever, a rigorous framework for error probability analysis of FAS under\nrealistic spatially correlated channels has been lacking. In this paper, we\nfill this gap by deriving a tight, closed-form asymptotic expression for the\nsymbol error rate (SER) that establishes the fundamental scaling law linking\nthe system's SER to the channel's spatial correlation structure. A key insight\nof our analysis is that the achievable diversity gain is governed not by the\nnumber of antenna ports, but by the channel's effective rank. To find this\ncritical parameter, we propose a novel dual-pronged approach. First of all, we\ndevelop a geometry-based algorithm that extracts distinct performance\nthresholds from the channel's eigenvalue spectrum. Second, we theoretically\nprove that the effective rank converges to a fundamental limit dictated solely\nby the antenna's normalized aperture width. We further establish the\nequivalence between the threshold identified by the geometric algorithm and the\nderived theoretical limit, providing rigorous validation for the proposed\nmethod. Our effective rank model achieves higher accuracy than existing\napproaches in the literature. Building on this framework, we offer a complete\ncharacterization of diversity and coding gains.

Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,\nare fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\\&When,\nstate-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\\% accuracy in locating the\nroot-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the\nfirst failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity\ncausal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a\nperformance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance\ndependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with\nShapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal\ndiscovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps\nby tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's\nattribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating\ntargeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual\nsimulations. Evaluations on the Who\\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a\nsignificant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\\% step-level\naccuracy.

To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,\nsecure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to\nenhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a\nuniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a\nproblem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals\nthat is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is\nbound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,\nbut as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due\nto fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can\nsimultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel\nsecure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather\nthan a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's\ndata by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding\naccuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs\nsimilarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect\nprivacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based\nprotocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model\naccuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice."}

We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning\nRepresentation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that\nincorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and\nclinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During\npretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that\nshare similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are\ndissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological\nsimilarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically\nmeaningful representations.

Existing approaches\ntypically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch\nexperts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in\ninference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading\nlatency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system\nwith a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically\ndivided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot\nexperts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,\nthereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic\npredicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top\nsegments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is\nreduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the\nperformance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each\nlayer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio).

Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of\nreal-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log\ncharacteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are\ngenerated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on\nassociational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping\nindividual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated\ncausal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,\nthe first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log\ncharacteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics.

To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to\ntrain LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL.

In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less\nprone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and\nthe ScalingInter-RL approach.
