Traditionally, turbo product decoding passes log likelihood ratios (LLRs) between the component decoders, inherently losing information when bit correlation exists. Such correlation can arise exogenously from sources like intersymbol interference and endogenously during component code decoding. To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u6982\u7387\u7684Turbo\u4e58\u79ef\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6bd4\u7279\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u5916\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u83b7\u5f970.3dB\u548c0.7dB\u7684\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTurbo\u4e58\u79ef\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u95f4\u4f20\u9012\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u65f6\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u6216\u5185\u90e8\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7fa4\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u7801\u66ff\u4ee3\u6bd4\u7279\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236Turbo\u4e58\u79ef\u7801\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b26\u53f7\u7ea7ORBGRAND\u548c\u8f6f\u8f93\u51faGRAND\u6765\u90e8\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u6982\u7387\u7684Turbo\u4e58\u79ef\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u5185\u751f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f970.3dB\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u5916\u751f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f970.7dB\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7fa4\u6982\u7387\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u6bd4\u7279\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347Turbo\u4e58\u79ef\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

First, channel measurement based on vector-network-analyzer (VNA) is conducted under typical V2X scenarios, including with/without human, and window-on/off cases. Then, a digital twin (DT) of the vehicle is constructed from high-resolution point cloud data and a measurement-based material property database.

The DT-empowered simulation results are analyzed and validated with the measurement data, showing strong agreement and validating the feasibility.

In multi-channel multi-tag AmBC, one of major challenges from the aspect of symbol detection is the image channel crosstalk, which is induced by the inevitable in-phase/quadrature (IQ) imbalance. To address this issue, in this paper, we study symbol detection in multi-channel multi-tag AmBC under IQ imbalance. Considering the differential encoding scheme at the BTs, we propose a novel symbol detection model that incorporates IQ imbalance parameters, the presence or absence of both the incident signal and the backscattered signal of the image channel. On this basis, considering an energy difference detector at the AmBC receiver, we derive the closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) as well as the near-optimal detection threshold to minimize BER. However, calculating the near-optimal detection threshold requires prior information, such as the IQ imbalance parameters, the presence probability of the incident signal of the image channel and the backscattered signal of the image channel, the signal power of the ambient RF source, and the noise power, which are typically unknown to the AmBC receiver in practice.

We begin by formally defining the desirable utility signaling mechanism and proving its ability to prevent suboptimal decisions for both participants and facilitate informed data trading. To design a protocol to realize its functionality, we propose leveraging maliciously secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and robustness of signal computation and introduce an MPC-based hash verification scheme to ensure input reliability.

This integration allows users to write declarative queries that combine relational operations with semantic reasoning, enabling them to query both structured and unstructured data effortlessly. However, making semantic operations efficient at production scale poses fundamental challenges. Semantic operations are more expensive than traditional SQL operations, possess distinct latency and throughput characteristics, and their cost and selectivity are unknown during query compilation. Furthermore, existing query engines are not designed to optimize semantic operations. The AISQL query execution engine addresses these challenges through three novel techniques informed by production deployment data from Snowflake customers. First, AI-aware query optimization treats AI inference cost as a first-class optimization objective, reasoning about large language model (LLM) cost directly during query planning to achieve 2-8$\\times$ speedups. Second, adaptive model cascades reduce inference costs by routing most rows through a fast proxy model while escalating uncertain cases to a powerful oracle model, achieving 2-6$\\times$ speedups while maintaining 90-95% of oracle model quality. Third, semantic join query rewriting lowers the quadratic time complexity of join operations to linear through reformulation as multi-label classification tasks, achieving 15-70$\\times$ speedups with often improved prediction quality.

The model leverages the visual and textual encoders of the CLIP architecture to obtain joint latent representations of fashion items, which are then integrated into a unified feature vector and processed by a transformer encoder. For compatibility prediction, an \"outfit token\" is introduced to model the holistic relationships among items, achieving an AUC of 0.95 on the Polyvore dataset.

However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5206\u914dFDD\u9891\u6bb5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u536b\u661f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9891\u6bb5\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe94%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u96c6\u6210\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u536b\u661f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7403\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u96c6\u5de8\u578b\u661f\u5ea7\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u9891\u6bb5\u4e0a\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e25\u91cd\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfFDD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9891\u6bb5\u5206\u914d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5236\u5b9a\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u9891\u6bb5\u5206\u914d\u3001\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u6548\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u51f8\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u52a8\u6001FDD\u9891\u6bb5\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfFDD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe94%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001FDD\u9891\u6bb5\u5206\u914d\u662f\u7ba1\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u536b\u661f\u90e8\u7f72\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This setting applies to many real-world scenarios, including when a school administrator wants to allocate resources (e.g., office spaces and supplies) to staff members in departments and when a city council allocates limited housing units to various families in need across different communities. To ensure fair allocation between agents, we consider the classical envy-freeness (EF) notion. To ensure fairness among the groups, we define the notion of centralized group equitability (CGEQ) to capture the fairness for the groups from the allocator's perspective. Because an EF or CGEQ allocation does not always exist in general, we consider their corresponding natural relaxations of envy-freeness to one item (EF1) and centralized group equitability up to one item (CGEQ1). For different classes of valuation functions of the agents and the centralized allocator, we show that allocations satisfying both EF1 and CGEQ1 always exist and design efficient algorithms to compute these allocations.

As real-world graphs continue to grow beyond the memory capacity of single machines, out-of-core graph processing systems have emerged as a viable solution. Yet, existing systems that rely on strictly synchronous, iteration-by-iteration execution incur significant overheads. In particular, their scheduling mechanisms lead to I/O inefficiencies, stemming from read and work amplification, and induce costly synchronization stalls hindering sustained disk utilization. To overcome these limitations, we present {\\em ACGraph}, a novel asynchronous graph processing system optimized for SSD-based environments with constrained memory resources. ACGraph employs a dynamic, block-centric priority scheduler that adjusts in real time based on workload, along with an online asynchronous worklist that minimizes redundant disk accesses by efficiently reusing active blocks in memory. Moreover, ACGraph unifies asynchronous I/O with computation in a pipelined execution model that maintains sustained I/O activation, and leverages a highly optimized hybrid storage format to expedite access to low-degree vertices. We implement popular graph algorithms, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Weakly Connected Components (WCC), personalized PageRank (PPR), PageRank (PR), and $k$-core on ACGraph and demonstrate that ACGraph substantially outperforms state-of-the-art out-of-core graph processing systems in both runtime and I/O efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACGraph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9SSD\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u7ea7\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u5217\u8868\u548c\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5916\u5b58\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548cI/O\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u5355\u673a\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5916\u5b58\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u540c\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728I/O\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u7ea7\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3001\u5728\u7ebf\u5f02\u6b65\u5de5\u4f5c\u5217\u8868\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6b65I/O\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5b58\u50a8\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728BFS\u3001WCC\u3001PPR\u3001PageRank\u548ck-core\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0cACGraph\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548cI/O\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5916\u5b58\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "ACGraph\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u5b58\u56fe\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684I/O\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Specifically, we model the satellites' spatial positions as a strong ball-regulated point process on the sphere. Under this model, proximal points in space exhibit a locally repulsive property, reflecting the fact that intersatellite links are protected by a safety distance and would not be arbitrarily close. Subsequently, we derive analytical lower bounds on the conditional coverage probabilities under Nakagami-$m$ and Rayleigh fading, respectively. These expressions have a low computational complexity, enabling efficient numerical evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of our theoretical model by contrasting the coverage probability obtained from our analysis with that estimated from a Starlink constellation.

Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries.

Consequently, many efforts have focused on learning disentangled representations through multi-domain joint training to bridge the domain gaps. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches show promise, they still face critical challenges, including: (1) the \\textbf{item ID tokenization dilemma}, which leads to vocabulary explosion and fails to capture high-order collaborative knowledge; and (2) \\textbf{insufficient domain-specific modeling} for the complex evolution of user interests and item semantics. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{GenCDR}, a novel \\textbf{Gen}erative \\textbf{C}ross-\\textbf{D}omain \\textbf{R}ecommendation framework. GenCDR first employs a \\textbf{Domain-adaptive Tokenization} module, which generates disentangled semantic IDs for items by dynamically routing between a universal encoder and domain-specific adapters. Symmetrically, a \\textbf{Cross-domain Autoregressive Recommendation} module models user preferences by fusing universal and domain-specific interests. Finally, a \\textbf{Domain-aware Prefix-tree} enables efficient and accurate generation.

However, in many scenarios, division of resources has a direct impact on the whole group or even society. Therefore, we study fair allocations of indivisible items that, at the same time, maximize social impact. In this model, each agent is associated with two additive functions that define their value and social impact for each item. The goal is to allocate items so that the social impact is maximized while maintaining some fairness criterion. We reveal that the complexity of the problem heavily depends on whether the agents are socially aware, i.e., they take into consideration the social impact functions. For socially unaware agents, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for a variety of fairness notions, and that it is tractable only for very restricted cases, e.g., if, for every agent, the valuation equals social impact and it is binary. On the other hand, social awareness allows for fair allocations that maximize social impact, and such allocations can be computed in polynomial time.

Hard-negative mining typically relies on ranking documents using cross-encoders or static embedding models based on similarity metrics such as cosine distance. Hard negative mining becomes challenging for biomedical and scientific domains due to the difficulty in distinguishing between source and hard negative documents. However, referenced documents naturally share contextual relevance with the source document but are not duplicates, making them well-suited as hard negatives. In this work, we propose BiCA: Biomedical Dense Retrieval with Citation-Aware Hard Negatives, an approach for hard-negative mining by utilizing citation links in 20,000 PubMed articles for improving a domain-specific small dense retriever. We fine-tune the GTE_small and GTE_Base models using these citation-informed negatives and observe consistent improvements in zero-shot dense retrieval using nDCG@10 for both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks on BEIR and outperform baselines on long-tailed topics in LoTTE using Success@5.

An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\u03bc$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\u03bc$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\u03bc$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\u03bc$ is bounded.\n  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\u03bd$ that approximates~$\u03bc$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\u03bd$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\u03bc$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\u03bd$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps. This last fact is key to unlocking our parallel runtime of $\\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a0\u901f\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\uff1a\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u4eceO(n)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(n^{1/2})", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u987a\u5e8f\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981O(n)\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u5e03\u03bd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u03bc\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u800c\u975e\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u6d4b", "result": "\u5c06\u671f\u671b\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u4eceO(n)\u964d\u4f4e\u5230O(n^{1/2})\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684O(n^{2/3})\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u63a8\u6d4b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c"}}

Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals: in equilibrium, the designer may deliberately reward those with lower likelihood ratios or concentrate rewards/penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u6839\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u5219\u5c5e\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5355\u9608\u503c\u548c\u53cc\u622a\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u6545\u610f\u5956\u52b1\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u6216\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1/\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u4e2a\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u6b3a\u9a97\u6216\u5f03\u6743\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u4e0e\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005-\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u9884\u671f\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u8c03\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u89c4\u5219\u5c5e\u4e8e\u5355\u9608\u503c\u548c\u53cc\u622a\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u5956\u52b1\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u6216\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1/\u60e9\u7f5a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u6bd4\u4e2a\u4f53\u6216\u4e2d\u95f4\u533a\u95f4\u6765\u6539\u5584\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Existing GR methods are based on auto-regressive generative models, i.e., the token generation is performed from left to right. However, such auto-regressive methods suffer from: (1) mismatch between DocID generation and natural language generation, e.g., an incorrect DocID token generated in early left steps would lead to totally erroneous retrieval; and (2) failure to balance the trade-off between retrieval efficiency and accuracy dynamically, which is crucial for practical applications. To address these limitations, we propose generative document retrieval with diffusion language models, dubbed DiffuGR. It models DocID generation as a discrete diffusion process: during training, DocIDs are corrupted through a stochastic masking process, and a diffusion language model is learned to recover them under a retrieval-aware objective. For inference, DiffuGR attempts to generate DocID tokens in parallel and refines them through a controllable number of denoising steps. In contrast to conventional left-to-right auto-regressive decoding, DiffuGR provides a novel mechanism to first generate more confident DocID tokens and refine the generation through diffusion-based denoising. Moreover, DiffuGR also offers explicit runtime control over the qualitylatency tradeoff. Extensive experiments on benchmark retrieval datasets show that DiffuGR is competitive with strong auto-regressive generative retrievers, while offering flexible speed and accuracy tradeoffs through variable denoising budgets. Overall, our results indicate that non-autoregressive diffusion models are a practical and effective alternative for generative document retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffuGR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DocID\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(1) DocID\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u9519\u8bef\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b8c\u5168\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff1b(2) \u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DocID\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7834\u574fDocIDs\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u5b83\u4eec\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210DocID tokens\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDiffuGR\u4e0e\u5f3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u53d8\u53bb\u566a\u9884\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5bb9\u5fcd\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

An algorithm proposed by Micali and Vazirani (1980) is well-known to solve the problem in $O(m\\sqrt{n})$ time, which is still one of the fastest algorithms in general. While the MV algorithm itself is not so complicated and is indeed convincing, its correctness proof is extremely challenging, which can be seen from the history: after the first algorithm paper had appeared in 1980, Vazirani has made several attempts to give a complete proof for more than 40 years. It seems, roughly speaking, caused by the nice but highly complex structure of the shortest alternating paths in general graphs that are deeply intertwined with the so-called (nested) blossoms.\n  In this paper, we propose a new structure theorem on the shortest alternating paths in general graphs without taking into the details of blossoms. The high-level idea is to forget the alternation (of matching and non-matching edges) as early as possible. A key ingredient is a notion of alternating base trees (ABTs) introduced by Izumi, Kitamura, and Yamaguchi (2024) to develop a nearly linear-time distributed algorithm. Our structure theorem refines the properties of ABTs exploited in their algorithm, and we also give simpler alternative proofs for them. Based on our structure theorem, we propose a new algorithm, which is slightly slower but more implementable and much easier to confirm its correctness than the MV algorithm.\n  As applications of our framework, we also present new $(1 - \u03b5)$-approximation algorithms in the distributed and semi-streaming settings. Both algorithms are deterministic, and substantially improve the best known upper bounds on the running time. The algorithms are built on the top of a novel framework of amplifying approximation factors of given matchings, which is of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u4ea4\u66ff\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u907f\u5f00\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u82b1\u6735\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5b9a\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6bd4Micali-Vazirani\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u534a\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684(1-\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "Micali-Vazirani\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u6781\u5176\u590d\u6742\uff0c40\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u96be\u4ee5\u7ed9\u51fa\u5b8c\u6574\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u66ff\u57fa\u6811(ABT)\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u6700\u77ed\u4ea4\u66ff\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u82b1\u6735\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6bd4MV\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u548c\u534a\u6d41\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684(1-\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u4ea4\u66ff\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Unlike classical results that address single-input multiple-output systems with complex Gaussian input signals, the developed ZZB in this paper explicitly accounts for a general input covariance matrix, target radar cross-section statistics and multiple snapshot effects, and admits a compact expression that reveals the dependence of the MSE on the number of transmit antennas, number of targets, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulations validate the tightness of the ZZB in the a priori dominated region and show how the increase of the number of transmit antennas compresses the threshold SNR for the transition to the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) while the variation of the number of targets shifts the bound's behavior across SNR regimes. The analytical results and numerical simulations demonstrate that the ZZB is tighter than the CRB, particularly in the low SNR regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5171\u5740MIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2dDoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684Ziv-Zakai\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u76ee\u6807RCS\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u5feb\u7167\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MSE\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u3001SNR\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9002\u7528\u4e8eMIMO\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e14\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\uff09\u7684\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86Ziv-Zakai\u4e0b\u754c\uff08ZZB\uff09\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u96f7\u8fbe\u6563\u5c04\u622a\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5feb\u7167\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ZZB\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u53d1\u5c04\u5929\u7ebf\u6570\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230CRB\u7684\u9608\u503cSNR\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u4e0d\u540cSNR\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002ZZB\u5728\u4f4eSNR\u533a\u57df\u6bd4CRB\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "ZZB\u4e3aMIMO\u96f7\u8fbeDoA\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4CRB\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4eSNR\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We are given multiple agents with hidden values (or quality scores), to whom resources must be allocated by a welfare-maximizing decision-maker. An intermediary with knowledge of the agents' values seeks to influence the outcome of the selection by designing informative signals and providing tie-breaking policies, so that when the receiver maximizes welfare over the resulting posteriors, the expected utilities of the agents (where utility is defined as allocation times value) achieve certain fairness properties. The fairness measure we will use is majorization, which simultaneously approximately maximizes all symmetric, monotone, concave functions of the utilities. We consider the general setting where the allocation to the agents needs to respect arbitrary submodular constraints, as given by the corresponding polymatroid.\n  We present a signaling policy that, under a mild bounded rationality assumption on the receiver, achieves a logarithmically approximate majorized policy in this setting. The approximation ratio is almost best possible, and that significantly outperforms generic results that only yield linear approximations. A key component of our result is a structural characterization showing that the vector of agent utilities for a given signaling policy defines the base polytope of a different polymatroid, a result that may be of independent interest. In addition, we show that an arbitrarily good additive approximation to this vector can be produced in (weakly) polynomial time via the multiplicative weights update method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u529d\u8bf4\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u4e86\u89e3\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u6253\u7834\u5e73\u5c40\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u9009\u62e9\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6548\u7528\uff08\u5206\u914d\u4e58\u4ee5\u4ef7\u503c\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u5b50\u6a21\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u6548\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7684\u57fa\u591a\u9762\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e58\u6027\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4ea7\u751f\u4efb\u610f\u597d\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5316\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u529d\u8bf4\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

On this background, we propose MARC, a multimodal and multi-task cocktail recommender system based on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizing graph database under cold-start conditions. The proposed system generates high-quality, contextually appropriate answers through two core processes: a task recognition router and a reflection process. The graph database was constructed by processing cocktail data from Kaggle, and its effectiveness was evaluated using 200 manually crafted questions. The evaluation used both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluation to demonstrate that answers generated via the graph database outperformed those from a simple vector database in terms of quality.

In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a \"see-saw\" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \\textbf{HID} (\\textbf{H}ybrid \\textbf{I}ntent-based \\textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional \"see-saw\" into \"win-win\" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \\textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \\textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \\textit{diversity} and \\textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "HID\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f1a\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u957f\u5c3e\u7269\u54c1\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53cc\u8d62\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5c3e\u7269\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\"\u8df7\u8df7\u677f\"\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u4f1a\u8bdd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHID\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u6df7\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u91cd\u6784\u7269\u54c1\u5230\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u610f\u56fe\uff1b2) \u610f\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u7269\u54c1\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSBR\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHID\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u5c3e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HID\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\"\u8df7\u8df7\u677f\"\u51b2\u7a81\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\"\u53cc\u8d62\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This paper was accepted to the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 2026. This is a pre-print version", "summary": "Reconfigurable networks are a novel communication paradigm in which the pattern of connectivity between hosts varies rapidly over time. Prior theoretical work explored the inherent tradeoffs between throughput (or, hop-count) and latency, and showed the existence of infinitely many Pareto-optimal designs as the network size tends to infinity. Existing Pareto-optimal designs use a connection schedule which is fine-tuned to the desired hop-count $h$, permitting lower latency as $h$ increases. However, in reality datacenter workloads contain a mix of low-latency and high-latency requests. Using a connection schedule fine-tuned for one request type leads to inefficiencies when serving other types.\n  A more flexible and efficient alternative is a {\\em universal schedule}, a single connection schedule capable of attaining many Pareto-optimal tradeoff points simultaneously, merely by varying the choice of routing paths. In this work we present the first universal schedules for oblivious routing. Our constructions yield universal schedules which are near-optimal for all possible hop-counts $h$. The key technical idea is to specialize to a type of connection schedule based on cyclic permutations and to develop a novel Fourier-analytic method for analyzing randomized routing on these connection schedules. We first show that a uniformly random connection schedule suffices with multiplicative error in throughput, and latency optimal up to a $\\log N$ factor. We then show that a more carefully designed random connection schedule suffices with additive error in throughput, but improved latency optimal up to only constant factors. Finally, we show that our first randomized construction can be made deterministic using a derandomized version of the Lovett-Meka discrepancy minimization algorithm to obtain the same result.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bf7\u6c42\u7c7b\u578b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u8df3\u6570h\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u7f6e\u6362\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u968f\u673a\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u8fde\u63a5\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u968f\u673a\u5316Lovett-Meka\u5dee\u5f02\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6784\u9020\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8df3\u6570h\u90fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u6784\u9020\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u4e58\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u4f18\u5230log N\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6784\u9020\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u52a0\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u4f18\u5230\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u611f\u77e5\u8def\u7531\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
