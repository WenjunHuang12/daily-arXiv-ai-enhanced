To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth. The proposed system has been already deployed at Kuaishou E-shop since 2025.6.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5feb\u624b\u7535\u5546\u63d0\u51faSTCRank\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u540c\u6392\u5e8f\u89e3\u51b3\u5168\u5c4fUI\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6ed1\u529f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9677\u9631\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u65e5\u6d3b\u53cc\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u624b\u7535\u5546\u5728\u4e3b\u9875\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u5916\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c4fUI\u548c\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6ed1\u529f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u3001\u6d4f\u89c8\u3001\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7b49\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u91cd\u53e0\u6216\u51b2\u7a81\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u6392\u5e8f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u69fd\u4f4d\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u9677\u9631\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u540c\u6392\u5e8f\uff08STCRank\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u534f\u540c\uff08MOC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u69fd\u4f4d\u534f\u540c\uff08MSC\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u524d\u77bb\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u5e8f\u5217\u69fd\u4f4d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u65e5\u6d3b\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u589e\u957f\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u4e8e2025\u5e746\u6708\u5728\u5feb\u624b\u7535\u5546\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0a\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "STCRank\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u5c4f\u7535\u5546\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8d2a\u5a6a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5355\u69fd\u4f4d\u5185\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u591a\u69fd\u4f4d\u95f4\uff09\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We identify the lack of {\\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness.

RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking).

STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Multiverse\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u7248\u672c\u548c\u591a\u7248\u672c\u4e8b\u52a1\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u578bSTM\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u652f\u6301\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSTM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\uff08\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u91cf\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u5730\u5740\uff09\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u7248\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f46\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7248\u672c\u5316\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiverse STM\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7248\u672c\u5316\u548c\u65e0\u7248\u672c\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u5e76\u53d1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u65e0\u7248\u672c\u4e8b\u52a1\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdbSTM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u7248\u672c\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0cMultiverse\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0cMultiverse\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709STM\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6STM\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "Multiverse\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u7248\u672c\u548c\u591a\u7248\u672cSTM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u957f\u8fd0\u884c\u8bfb\u53d6\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5e38\u89c4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Current tokenomic models, which predominantly rely on static or threshold-based buyback heuristics, are ill-equipped to handle complex system dynamics and often function pro-cyclically, exacerbating instability during market downturns. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic-Control Buyback Mechanism (DCBM), a formalized control-theoretic framework that utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with strict solvency constraints to regulate the token economy as a dynamical system. Extensive agent-based simulations utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes demonstrate that DCBM fundamentally outperforms static baselines, reducing token price volatility by approximately 66% and lowering operator churn from 19.5% to 8.1% in high-volatility regimes. These findings establish that converting tokenomics from static rules into continuous, structurally constrained control loops is a necessary condition for secure and sustainable decentralized intelligence networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8ePID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56de\u8d2d\u673a\u5236DCBM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u7a33\u5b9a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316AI\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1166%\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316AI\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u957f\u671f\u751f\u5b58\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u5176\u539f\u751f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5c42\u6781\u7aef\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u6216\u9608\u503c\u56de\u8d2d\u7684\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u5f80\u5f80\u5177\u6709\u987a\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u4e0b\u8dcc\u65f6\u52a0\u5267\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u56de\u8d2d\u673a\u5236(DCBM)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u507f\u4ed8\u80fd\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b-\u79ef\u5206-\u5fae\u5206(PID)\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8282\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "DCBM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee3\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u6ce2\u52a8\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea666%\uff0c\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u6d41\u5931\u7387\u4ece19.5%\u964d\u81f38.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4ee3\u5e01\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u89c4\u5219\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u662f\u786e\u4fdd\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

As algorithms are increasingly used in decision-making over datapoints with sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it is becoming crucial to enforce fairness to avoid bias and discrimination. Recent work has addressed the challenge of developing efficient approximation algorithms for fair matroid submodular maximization. However, the best algorithms known so far are only guaranteed to satisfy a relaxed version of the fairness constraints that loses a factor 2, i.e., the problem may ask for $\\ell$ elements with a given attribute, but the algorithm is only guaranteed to find $\\lfloor \\ell/2 \\rfloor$. In particular, there is no provable guarantee when $\\ell=1$, which corresponds to a key special case of perfect matching constraints.\n  In this work, we achieve a new trade-off via an algorithm that gets arbitrarily close to full fairness. Namely, for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, we give a constant-factor approximation to fair monotone matroid submodular maximization that in expectation loses only a factor $(1-\\varepsilon)$ in the lower-bound fairness constraint.

While recent methods achieve high-quality lip synchronization, they often rely on discrete emotion categories, limiting continuous and fine-grained emotional control. We present EditEmoTalk, a controllable speech-driven 3D facial animation framework with continuous emotion editing. The key idea is a boundary-aware semantic embedding that learns the normal directions of inter-emotion decision boundaries, enabling a continuous expression manifold for smooth emotion manipulation. Moreover, we introduce an emotional consistency loss that enforces semantic alignment between the generated motion dynamics and the target emotion embedding through a mapping network, ensuring faithful emotional expression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EditEmoTalk achieves superior controllability, expressiveness, and generalization while maintaining accurate lip synchronization.

This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources.

Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model.

Together, these approaches span the spectrum between static equilibrium consistency and dynamic behavioral realism. We evaluate them on synthetic \"chicken-dare\" games and traffic-interaction scenarios simulated in SUMO, comparing parameter recovery and distributional fit.

For example, it is often used for query evaluation in probabilistic databases. Due to the computational intractability of exact DNF counting, there has been a line of research into a variety of approximation algorithms. These include Monte Carlo approaches such as the classical algorithms of Karp, Luby, and Madras (1989), as well as methods based on hashing (Soos et al. 2023), and heuristic approximations based on Neural Nets (Abboud, Ceylan, and Lukasiewicz 2020).\n  We develop a new Monte Carlo approach with an adaptive stopping rule and short-circuit formula evaluation. We prove it achieves Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning bounds and is asymptotically more efficient than the previous methods. We also show experimentally that it out-performs prior algorithms by orders of magnitude, and can scale to much larger problems with millions of variables.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684DNF\u516c\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u77ed\u8def\u516c\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "DNF\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u5728\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u89e3\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ecKarp-Luby-Madras\u7ecf\u5178\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u54c8\u5e0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u77ed\u8def\u516c\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u91c7\u6837\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u65f6\u63d0\u524d\u505c\u6b62\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u8def\u8bc4\u4f30\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u6e10\u8fd1\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728DNF\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, the perfect OCPC, where the number of bands is unlimited, is an extremely simple continuous-time memoryless channel. It has a capacity 1, zero channel dispersion, and an information spectrum being the degenerate distribution at 1. It is the only known nontrivial (discrete or continuous-time) memoryless channel with a closed-form formula for its optimal non-asymptotic error probability, making it the simplest channel in this sense. A potential application is optical communication with a tunable band rejection filter. Due to its simplicity, we may use it as a basic currency of information that is infinitely divisible, as an alternative to bits which are not infinitely divisible. OCPC with perfect feedback gives a generalization of prefix codes.

The evaluation follows the same test methodology and conditions previously defined for MPEG multilayer video coding assessments, with the LCEVC enhancement layer encoded using version 8.1 of the LCEVC Test Model (LTM). The test compares reconstructed UHD output generated from an HD VVC base layer with LCEVC enhancement against two reference cases: upsampled VVC base layer decoding and multilayer VVC (ML-VVC).

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSDP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u6392\u540d\u53d1\u73b0top-k\u51fd\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u8c03\u4e0a\u754c\u526a\u679d\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684FD\u53d1\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFD\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u5e73\u65b9\u589e\u957f\u3001\u968f\u5c5e\u6027\u6570\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u679c\u96c6\u8fc7\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSDP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u6392\u540d\u53d1\u73b0top-k\u51fd\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u4e0a\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u526a\u679d\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u6309\u5206\u533a\u57fa\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u533a\u57fa\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u6536\u7d27\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f18\u5148\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u572840\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDP\u6bd4\u7a77\u4e3e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u5f97\u591a\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u53d1\u73b0top-k\u51fd\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "SDP\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u51fd\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u6392\u540d\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u3002"}}

Despite the first data structure for this fundamental problem -- the link-cut tree -- being invented 40 years ago, our experiments reveal that they are still the fastest sequential data structure for the problem. However, link-cut trees cannot support parallel batch-dynamic updates and have limitations on the kinds of queries they support.\n  In this paper, we design a new parallel batch-dynamic trees data structure called UFO trees that simultaneously supports a wide range of query functionality, supports work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic updates, and is competitive with link-cut trees when run sequentially. We prove that a key reason for the strong practical performance of both link-cut trees and UFO trees is that they can perform updates and queries in sub-logarithmic time for low-diameter trees. We perform an experimental study of our optimized C++ implementations of UFO trees with ten other dynamic tree implementations, several of which are new, in a broad benchmark of both synthetic and real-world trees of varying diameter and size. Our results show that, in both sequential and parallel settings, UFO trees are the fastest dynamic tree data structure that supports a wide range of queries.

The proposed scheme guarantees correctness and information-theoretic privacy against threshold-bounded, semi-honest colluding agents, under explicit local storage constraints. Our scheme encodes submatrices as evaluations of sparse masking polynomials and combines coefficient alignment with Beaver-style randomness to ensure perfect secrecy. We demonstrate that any colluding set of parties below the security threshold observes uniformly random shares, and that the recovery threshold is optimal, matching existing information-theoretic limits. Building on this framework, we introduce a learning-augmented extension that integrates tensor-decomposition-based local block multiplication, capturing both classical and learned low-rank methods. We demonstrate that the proposed learning-based PSMM preserves privacy and recovery guarantees for MPC, while providing scalable computational efficiency gains (up to $80\\%$) as the matrix dimensions grow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97A\u22a4B\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6062\u590d\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u672c\u5730\u5b58\u50a8\u7ea6\u675f\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e9\u9635\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u63a9\u7801\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5b50\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cfb\u6570\u5bf9\u9f50\u548cBeaver\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u6027\u786e\u4fdd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4fdd\u5bc6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5757\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u534f\u8bae\u5728\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u6709\u754c\u534a\u8bda\u5b9e\u5408\u8c0b\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5408\u8c0b\u65b9\u53ea\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u4efd\u989d\uff1b\u6062\u590d\u9608\u503c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6781\u9650\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7248\u672c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u77e9\u9635\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe80%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u534f\u8bae\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6062\u590d\u9608\u503c\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u5c55\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u77e9\u9635\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u591a\u65b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u8fd0\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In graph-based replication, the system consists of $K$ files replicated across $N$ servers according to a graph with $N$ vertices and $K$ edges. The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes. An extension of our scheme to the case of multigraphs achieves a higher rate than previous schemes for the complete multi-graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u590d\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u661f\u5f62\u56fe\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u590d\u5236\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u534f\u8bae\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1) \u9488\u5bf9\u661f\u5f62\u56fe\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u65b9\u6848\uff1b2) \u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u96c6\u5206\u89e3\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u91cd\u56fe\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u91cd\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4f4d\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u661f\u5f62\u56fe\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u661f\u5f62\u56fe\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u65b9\u6848\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u56fe\u4e0a\u901f\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u3002\u591a\u91cd\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u91cd\u56fe\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u5316\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u901f\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u590d\u5236\u7684PIR\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose a unified probabilistic framework to construct L-PIR-SI schemes where the privacy leakage is quantified by a parameter $\\varepsilon$, consistent with differential privacy standards. We characterize the achievable download costs and show that our results generalize several landmark results in the PIR literature: they recover the capacity of PIR-SI when $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, and reduce to the known bounds for leaky-PIR when side information is absent.

In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold.

Moreover, a rich line of list decoding algorithms was developed for FRS codes. It is then natural to ask if FRS codes can be shown to exhibit an analogous $(\u03b4,\\varepsilon)$-proximity gap, but up to the so-called optimal capacity regime. We answer this question in the affirmative (and the framework naturally applies more generally to suitable subspace-design codes).\n  An additional motivation to understand proximity gaps for FRS codes is the recent results [BCDZ'25] showing that they exhibit properties similar to random linear codes, which were previously shown to be related to properties of RS codes with random evaluation points in [LMS'25], as well as codes over constant-size alphabet based on AEL [JS'25].", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6298\u53e0\u91cc\u5fb7-\u6240\u7f57\u95e8\u7801\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u5bb9\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cRS\u7801\u7684(\u03b4,\u03b5)-\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\u3002", "motivation": "Ben-Sasson\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\u4eff\u5c04\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u96c6\u5408\u5bf9\u4e8eRS\u7801\u5b58\u5728(\u03b4,\u03b5)-\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u9002\u7528\u4e8eJohnson\u754c\u8303\u56f4\u3002FRS\u7801\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u534a\u5f84\u03b4\uff08\u5bb9\u91cf\u533a\u57df\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76FRS\u7801\u662f\u5426\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u5bb9\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3cBen-Sasson\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9FRS\u7801\u7684\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u7136\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528FRS\u7801\u7684\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u80af\u5b9a\u5730\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\uff1aFRS\u7801\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u5bb9\u91cf\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728(\u03b4,\u03b5)-\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86RS\u7801\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "FRS\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86RS\u7801\u7684\u90bb\u8fd1\u95f4\u9699\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3FRS\u7801\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7801\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we study optimal single-error correcting FCCs (SEFCCs) for maximally-unbalanced Boolean functions, where $k$ denotes the message length and $t$ denotes the error-correction capability. We analyze the structure of optimal SEFCC constructions through their associated codeword distance matrices and identify distinct FCC classes based on this structure. We then examine the impact of these structural differences on error performance by evaluating representative FCCs over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using both soft-decision and hard-decision decoding. The results show that FCCs with different distance-matrix structures can exhibit markedly different Data BER and function error behavior, and that the influence of code structure depends strongly on the decoding strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5355\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u7ea0\u6b63\u7801\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u8bef\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51fd\u6570\u7ea0\u6b63\u7801\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u5168\u6062\u590d\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684FCC\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u7801\u5b57\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18SEFCC\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540cFCC\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6f\u5224\u51b3\u548c\u786c\u5224\u51b3\u89e3\u7801\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee3\u8868\u6027FCC\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u77e9\u9635\u7ed3\u6784\u7684FCC\u5728\u6570\u636eBER\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "FCC\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u5176\u9519\u8bef\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u4e0e\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, these new constructions can also offer circulant sizes asymptotically about 25% smaller than the novel bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728GCD\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u955c\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u884c\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee3\u6570\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5217\u91cd\u4e3a7\u548c8\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u6781\u77ed\u3001\u56f4\u957f\u4e3a8\u7684QC-LDPC\u7801\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea620%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5177\u6709\u5927\u56f4\u957f\u7684\u51c6\u5faa\u73afLDPC\u7801\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u800c\u975e\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6784\u9020\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u6700\u77ed\u53ef\u80fd\u957f\u5ea6\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff09\u7684\u6b64\u7c7b\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5148\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u5927\u516c\u7ea6\u6570(GCD)\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u955c\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u884c\u91cd\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u5f0f\u6784\u9020\u5217\u91cd\u4e3a7\u548c8\u3001\u4efb\u610f\u884c\u91cd\u3001\u56f4\u957f\u4e3a8\u7684QC-LDPC\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5217\u91cd7\u548c8\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea620%\u3002\u65b0\u6784\u9020\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u65b0\u4e0b\u754c\u5c0f\u7ea625%\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u5217\u91cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u77ed\u7684QC-LDPC\u7801\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7801\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u610f\u7528\u6237-\u7f13\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u63a5\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MACC\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u7528\u6237-\u7f13\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u51b2\u7a81\u56fe\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u8f93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2) \u6269\u5c55\u4efb\u610f\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u7f16\u7801\u4e0b\u754c\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u591a\u64ad\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b4) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8d2a\u5a6a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4f20\u8f93\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1DSatur\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbf\u95ee\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u62d3\u6251MACC\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While the capacity of the noiseless frequency-based channel has been previously addressed, the effect of identification noise has not been fully characterized. We present a converse bound on the channel capacity that follows from stochastic degradation and the data processing inequality. We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise.

Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eL-half-sum disjoint packing\u7ed3\u6784\u7684MISO\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4(F=K)\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8sum-DoF\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MISO\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927sum-DoF\u65f6\uff0c\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u6570F\u968f\u7528\u6237\u6570K\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8sum-DoF\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62c9\u4e01\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06F=K\u7684MAPDA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aL-half-sum disjoint packing\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6784\u9020\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efaL-HSDP\u6765\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684MISO\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684L-HSDP\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\u6307\u6570\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u727a\u7272sum-DoF\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684sum-DoF\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7L-HSDP\u7ed3\u6784\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4(F=K)\u7684MISO\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548csum-DoF\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent algebraic results express the contribution of individual bit-channels to the multiplicities of minimum and near-minimum weight codewords in closed form. In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity. Numerical results for short and moderate lengths on BPSK-AWGN, implemented via Gaussian approximation and closed-form weight contributions, illustrate the trade-off between pure reliability-based and mixed constructions in terms of minimum distance, multiplicity, and union-bound approximations.

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples.

Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \\textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost.

However, its integration with higher-layer techniques, such as semantic communication, remains underexplored. This paper investigates the energy efficiency maximization problem in a resource-constrained VLC-based probabilistic semantic communication (PSCom) system. In the considered model, light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters perform semantic compression to reduce data size, which incurs additional computation overhead. The compressed semantic information is transmitted to the users for semantic inference using a shared knowledge base that requires periodic updates to ensure synchronization. In the PSCom system, the knowledge base is represented by probabilistic graphs. To enable simultaneous transmission of both knowledge and information data, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed. The optimization problem focuses on maximizing energy efficiency by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming, direct current (DC) bias, common rate allocation, and semantic compression ratio, while accounting for both communication and computation costs. To solve this problem, an alternating optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach method is developed.

The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $\u039b$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\\min\\{L+KM/N, K\\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u591a\u63a5\u5165MISO\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc70-1\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u653e\u7f6e\u4ea4\u4ed8\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "motivation": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u591a\u63a5\u5165MISO\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u653e\u7f6e\u4ea4\u4ed8\u9635\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a0-1\u80cc\u5305\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u7f13\u5b58\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u8fbe\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u5927\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b50\u5206\u7ec4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u591a\u63a5\u5165MISO\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We first generalize the Hotplug Placement Delivery Array (HpPDA) framework to the combinatorial multi-access setting. Based on this generalized framework, we propose a t-design-based coded caching scheme for combinatorial multi-access networks. We characterize a class of design parameters under which every active user has access to a sufficient number of coded subfiles to decode its requested file, and show that appropriate parameter choices allow for the elimination of redundant multicast transmissions. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a family of rate memory trade offs with flexible subpacketization.

The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme.

Further, for testing against independence, we also compute classical random coding exponents and show that truncation, and consequently any linear code, is strictly suboptimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u4e8c\u5143\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u901f\u7387\u5411\u4e2d\u592e\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4f20\u8f93\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u622a\u65ad\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6848\uff1a(1)\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u540c\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f46\u7b26\u53f7\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c(2)\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6216\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u6570\u503c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u622a\u65ad\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u4f55\u7b26\u53f7\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u90fd\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u622a\u65ad\uff08\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4e25\u683c\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u7ebf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u76f8\u5173\u5411\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u901f\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u5982\u622a\u65ad\uff09\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u5173\u4e8c\u5143\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u540c\u901f\u7387\u5411\u4e2d\u592e\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u4f20\u8f93\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u622a\u65ad\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u622a\u65ad\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\u6307\u6570\u7528\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u622a\u65ad\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6848\uff1a(1)\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u540c\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f46\u7b26\u53f7\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c(2)\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u6216\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u3002\u6570\u503c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u622a\u65ad\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u4f55\u7b26\u53f7\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u90fd\u662f\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u663e\u793a\u622a\u65ad\uff08\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u7ebf\u6027\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u4e25\u683c\u52a3\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u622a\u65ad\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u52a3\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8db3\u591f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While existing literature extensively covers link-level designs, the transition toward large-scale deployment necessitates a fundamental understanding of network-level performance. This paper investigates a network ISAC model where a source node communicates with a destination via a relay network, while intermediate nodes concurrently perform cooperative sensing over specific spatial regions. We formulate a novel optimization framework that captures the interplay between multi-node routing and sensing coverage. For a one-dimensional path network, we provide an analytical characterization of the complete sensing-throughput region. Extending this to general network topologies, we establish that the sensing-throughput Pareto boundary is piecewise linear and provide physical interpretations for each segment. Our results reveal the fundamental trade-offs between sensing coverage and communication routing, offering key insights for the design of future 6G heterogeneous networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u533a\u57df\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ISAC\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u94fe\u8def\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7f51\u7edcISAC\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u533a\u57df\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u822c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u7ef4\u8def\u5f84\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u8def\u7531\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u6bb5\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a6G\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u7ea7ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u8def\u7531\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G\u5f02\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ISAC\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts.

At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $\u0394$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $\u0394$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse.

Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers.

However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Chandan\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f31\u79c1\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22(WPIR)\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u7684\u53cd\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "Chandan\u7b49\u4eba\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u65e0\u5408\u8c0b\u548cT-\u5408\u8c0b\u573a\u666f\u7684WPIR\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u901f\u7387-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u672a\u77e5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u5426\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u4f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u8bc1\u660eChandan\u7b49\u4eba\u7684Sun-Jafar\u578b\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u65e0\u5408\u8c0b\u590d\u5236\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u660eBanawan-Ulukus\u578bMDS-WPIR\u548cSun-Jafar\u578bT-\u5408\u8c0bWPIR\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\u6ee1\u8db3\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff1b3) \u5f53\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u901f\u7387\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "1) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Chandan\u7b49\u4eba\u7684Sun-Jafar\u578b\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u65e0\u5408\u8c0b\u590d\u5236\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0cBanawan-Ulukus\u578bMDS-WPIR\u548cSun-Jafar\u578bT-\u5408\u8c0bWPIR\u65b9\u6848\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\uff1b3) \u5f53\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u6210\u7acb\u65f6\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u53cd\u4f8b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u901f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86Chandan\u7b49\u4ebaWPIR\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a\u5728\u65e0\u5408\u8c0b\u590d\u5236\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b8c\u5168\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5728MDS\u7f16\u7801\u548cT-\u5408\u8c0b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u5f53\u9608\u503c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76WPIR\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6781\u9650\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u6b21\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e7f\u64ad\u5230K\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u6e90\u5373\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7801\u672c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7801\u672c\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5206\u7ec4\u5e73\u8861\u7801\u672c\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5171\u4eab\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5e7f\u64ad\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5355\u6b21\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4fe1\u6e90\u88ab\u7f16\u7801\u4e00\u6b21\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u4fe1\u9053\u5e7f\u64ad\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u662f\u81f3\u5c11\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5931\u771f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u4fe1\u6e90\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6062\u590d\u6982\u7387\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7801\u672c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7801\u672c\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5206\u7ec4\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u7801\u672c\u5206\u96c6\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u96c6\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u53ef\u8fbe\u754c\uff1b4) \u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "1) \u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7801\u672c\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\uff1b2) \u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5bf9\u79f0\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u5171\u4eab\u7801\u672c\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u6cca\u677e\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u7406\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53ef\u8fbe\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u8054\u5408\u4fe1\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u5e7f\u64ad\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7801\u672c\u5206\u96c6\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u589e\u76ca\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7801\u672c\u5206\u96c6\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u591a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5e7f\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91cf\u5b50\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u5b58\u50a8-\u5e26\u5bbd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u5982\u4f55\u7a81\u7834\u7ecf\u5178\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5728(n,k,d)\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5e2e\u52a9\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u4fe1\u9053\u5411\u65b0\u8282\u70b9\u4f20\u8f93\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65b0\u8282\u70b9\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u63a5\u6536\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u50a8\u3002\u5206\u6790\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u5bf9\u5b58\u50a8-\u5e26\u5bbd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u7f20\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8-\u5e26\u5bbd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5b58\u50a8\u518d\u751f\u70b9\u3002\u5f53d\u22652k-2\u65f6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u901a\u4fe1\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Deep neural networks are able to capture rich dependencies in data, offering a powerful means of estimating these probabilities and hence an avenue towards more effective compression algorithms. However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data.

Sender privacy is obtained asymptotically via channel polarization combined with privacy amplification. Because the construction deliberately injects randomness on selected bad bit-channels, we derive a relaxed reliability criterion and evaluate finite-blocklength performance.

Comments welcome", "summary": "Nitinawarat and Narayan proposed a perfect secret key generation scheme for the so-called \\emph{pairwise independent network (PIN) model} by exploiting the combinatorial properties of the underlying graph, namely the spanning tree packing rate. This work considers a generalization of the PIN model where the underlying graph is replaced with a hypergraph, and makes progress towards designing similar perfect secret key generation schemes by exploiting the combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.\n  Our contributions are two-fold. We first provide a capacity achieving scheme for a complete $t$-uniform hypergraph on $m$ vertices by leveraging a packing of the complete $t$-uniform hypergraphs by what we refer to as star hypergraphs, and designing a scheme that gives $\\binom{m-2}{t-2}$ bits of perfect secret key per star graph. Our second contribution is a 2-bit perfect secret key generation scheme for 3-uniform star hypergraphs whose projections are cycles. This scheme is then extended to a perfect secret key generation scheme for generic 3-uniform hypergraphs by exploiting star graph packing of 3-uniform hypergraphs and Hamiltonian packings of graphs. The scheme is then shown to be capacity achieving for certain classes of hypergraphs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86PIN\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168t-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u8fbe\u5230\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "Nitinawarat\u548cNarayan\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PIN\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6811\u6253\u5305\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u9488\u5bf9\u5b8c\u5168t-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u661f\u8d85\u56fe\u6253\u5305\u5b8c\u5168t-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u661f\u56fe\u751f\u6210binom(m-2,t-2)\u6bd4\u7279\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bc6\u94a5\u7684\u65b9\u6848\n2. \u9488\u5bf93-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6295\u5f71\u4e3a\u73af\u76843-\u5747\u5300\u661f\u8d85\u56fe\u76842\u6bd4\u7279\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u661f\u56fe\u6253\u5305\u548c\u56fe\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6253\u5305\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e00\u822c3-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe", "result": "1. \u5b8c\u5168t-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u8fbe\u5230\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\n2. 3-\u5747\u5300\u8d85\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u8d85\u56fe\u7c7b\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\n3. \u6210\u529f\u5c06PIN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u56fe", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bc6\u94a5\u751f\u6210\u4ece\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u56fe\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u8fbe\u5230\u5bb9\u91cf\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
