However, game-theoretic\nmodels often fail to distinguish between cooperative behaviour and trust. This\nmakes it difficult to measure trust and determine its effect in different\nsocial dilemmas. We address this here by formalising trust as a cognitive\nshortcut in repeated games. This functions by avoiding checking a partner's\nactions once a threshold level of cooperativeness has been observed. We\nconsider trust-based strategies that implement this heuristic, and\nsystematically analyse their evolution across the space of two-player symmetric\nsocial dilemma games. We find that where it is costly to check whether another\nagent's actions were cooperative, as is the case in many real-world settings,\nthen trust-based strategies can outcompete standard reciprocal strategies such\nas Tit-for-Tat in many social dilemmas. Moreover, the presence of trust\nincreases the overall level of cooperation in the population, especially in\ncases where agents can make unintentional errors in their actions. This occurs\neven in the presence of strategies designed to build and then exploit trust.\nOverall, our results demonstrate the individual adaptive benefit to an agent of\nusing a trust heuristic, and provide a formal theory for how trust can promote\ncooperation in different types of social interaction. We discuss the\nimplications of this for interactions between humans and artificial\nintelligence agents."}

We present a\ngame-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning\nnetworks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and\naccuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by\ndecomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the\nlocal utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global\nutility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the\nCPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time\nto an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability\ncriteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring\nnodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within\ncommunities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these\nobjectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community\ntracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden\nalgorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that\nrobust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities."}

In\npractice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects\nare tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can\nbias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic\nMDPs.

Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model.

In this work, we\nreframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a\ngoal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a\ngenerative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize\nincreasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**\nagents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,\ngoal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,\nconfigurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'\nweaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative\npolicy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates\na self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to\nchallenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively\ninfinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that\nthis framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world\nmodel learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders\nlearning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position\nadversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world\nmodels that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness."}

Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and\npractitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then\nused to align AI behavior with that of humans.

In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero\nagents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the\ncombination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly\nboost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The\ncode is publicly available on GitHub."}

Our upstream models are trained on extensive data\nsources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture\nintricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure\nscalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and\nregularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for\nasynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These\nembeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,\nincluding ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in\nboth offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This\nframework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,\nresulting in significant gains in online metrics."}

External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and\nrecent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an\nopportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving\nbeyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or\nsummaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward\nconcept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution\ntraces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts\nare selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time\ncontinual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies\nfor abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,\npromoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On\nthe challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over\na strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference\ncompute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,\noutscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we\nconfirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an\notherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting\nthe hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to\nmemory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement.
