However, existing methods are typically limited to\nextracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability\nto extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these\nmethods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces\nsignificant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel\n\\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel\nOptimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can\nsimultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual\nentities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features\nfor different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts\nmechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.\nAdditionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential\nencoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,\nwe adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level\nfeatures while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive\nrepresentations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation\nExtraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,\nencompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from\neither text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively\nextracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art\nperformanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets.

ProToM first infers agents'\ngoals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by\nmaximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We\nevaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,\nKeys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that\nstate-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of\ncommunicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -\nleading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM\nprovides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,\nshorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users."}

We argue that first-order\noptimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly\nreshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral\nFusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and\ninformation fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core\nprinciples: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically\nbalances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting\nfrequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or\ntraining pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the\nsecond-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and\nimplement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that\nadaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative\nexponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens\nspectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early\ndecision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains\nhigh. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and\nfixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test\nerror and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches\nbaseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost.

Instead, we\ndemonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted\nsuccessor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few\ninitial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the\nentry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor\nmeasure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation\nand estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral\nrecoverability of the corresponding matrix.

Blind tests show\nthat the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call\nwhile underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these\nshortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design\nlessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and\nautomated evaluation."}

This work proposes an ontology-based approach\nto formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in\nnature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative\ndefinitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into\nan ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to\nthe task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language\nproficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in\ndescription logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled\ntext generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level\ndefinitions, improving transparency in conversational AI."}

In this paper, we study the problem of approximating\nthe $f$-divergence between two Ising models, which is a generalization of\nrecent work on approximating the TV-distance. Given two Ising models $\\nu$ and\n$\\mu$, which are specified by their interaction matrices and external fields,\nthe problem is to approximate the $f$-divergence $D_f(\\nu\\,\\|\\,\\mu)$ within an\narbitrary relative error $\\mathrm{e}^{\\pm \\varepsilon}$. For\n$\\chi^\\alpha$-divergence with a constant integer $\\alpha$, we establish both\nalgorithmic and hardness results. The algorithm works in a parameter regime\nthat matches the hardness result. Our algorithm can be extended to other\n$f$-divergences such as $\\alpha$-divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence,\nR\\'enyi divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and squared Hellinger distance."}

In\ncontrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on\nsuch graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by\nthis disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While\na direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we\novercome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the\nresistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$\nand $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact\nlabelling structures. Based on this, we propose \\treeindex, a novel index\nmethod that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \\cdot\nh_{\\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \\cdot h_{\\mathcal{G}}^2 \\cdot d_{\\max})$ time, where\n$h_{\\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small\nconstants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our\nlabelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\\mathcal{G}})$ time and\nsingle-source queries in $O(n \\cdot h_{\\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive\nexperiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$\nGB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair\nqueries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the\nfirst exact method scalable to such large graphs."}

World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.
