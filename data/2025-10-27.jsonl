In\ncontrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with\ndetailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify\nwhether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a\nmethodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a\ncomprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched\nmetadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full\nversion is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable\nthresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download\nand use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce\nthe full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity\nscores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures\nidentify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses\nin Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity.\nFinally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation\nof POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial\nanalyses and a range of downstream applications."}

Under the\nexchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as\na parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an\ninfinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are\nLipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate\n$\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous\nsetting, we prove the same $\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the\nimportant special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in\ndynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel\napproximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive\nDesign (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated\nequilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting\napproximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful,\nscalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction\nsettings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over\nfirst-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods."}

Specifically, the attention-based model\noutperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both\nshort- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on\nitem co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,\nleading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To\naddress this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal\nattention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal\ndiscovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the\ncausal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee\nthe identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the\ndiscovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing\nbehaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world\ndatasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,\nwith average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized\nDiscounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
