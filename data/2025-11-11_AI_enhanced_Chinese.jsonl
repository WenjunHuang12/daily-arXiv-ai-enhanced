This family of problems consists of games between two players: the leader and the follower. There is a market that is partitioned into two parts: the part of the leader and the part of the leader's competitors. The leader controls one part of the market and can freely set the prices for products. By contrast, the prices of the competitors' products are fixed and known in advance. The follower, then, needs to solve a combinatorial optimization problem in order to satisfy their own demands, while comparing the leader's offers to the offers of the competitors. Therefore, the leader has to hit the intricate balance of making an attractive offer to the follower, while at the same time ensuring that their own profit is maximized.\n  Pferschy, Nicosia, Pacifici, and Schauer considered the Stackelberg pricing game where the follower solves a knapsack problem. They raised the question whether this problem is complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, i.e., $\u03a3^p_2$-complete. The same conjecture was also made by B\u00f6hnlein, Schaudt, and Schauer. In this paper, we positively settle this conjecture. Moreover, we show that this result holds actually in a much broader context: The Stackelberg pricing game is $\u03a3^p_2$-complete for over 50 NP-complete problems, including most classics such as TSP, vertex cover, clique, subset sum, etc. This result falls in line of recent meta-theorems about higher complexity in the polynomial hierarchy by Gr\u00fcne and Wulf.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Stackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\uff08\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e50\u591a\u4e2aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5305\u62ecTSP\u3001\u9876\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u56e2\u3001\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u7b49\uff09\u662f\u03a3^p_2-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Pferschy\u7b49\u4eba\u548cB\u00f6hnlein\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u4e8eStackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u03a3^p_2-\u5b8c\u5168\u7c7b\u7684\u731c\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684NP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793aStackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u8ffd\u968f\u8005\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u79cdNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Stackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fc750\u4e2aNP\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u03a3^p_2-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5305\u62ec\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u9876\u70b9\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u56e2\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u7acb\u4e86Stackelberg\u5b9a\u4ef7\u535a\u5f08\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6027\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e0eGr\u00fcne\u548cWulf\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u66f4\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5143\u5b9a\u7406\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

It finds applications in diverse domains, including computer networks, transportation, and image segmentation. The core idea is to maximise the total flow across the network without violating capacity constraints on edges and ensuring flow conservation at intermediate nodes. The rapid growth of unstructured and semi-structured data has motivated the development of parallel solutions to compute MaxFlow. However, due to the higher computational complexity, computing Maxflow for real-world graphs is time-consuming in practice. In addition, these graphs are dynamic and constantly evolve over time. In this work, we propose two Push-Relabel based algorithms for processing dynamic graphs on GPUs. The key novelty of our algorithms is their ability to efficiently handle both increments and decrements in edge capacities together when they appear in a batch. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithms with a suite of real-world graphs. Overall, we find that for small updates, dynamic recomputation is significantly faster than a static GPU-based Maxflow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePush-Relabel\u7684GPU\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6279\u91cf\u8fb9\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u51cf\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4e14\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u975e\u5e38\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePush-Relabel\u7684GPU\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6279\u91cf\u8fb9\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u51cf\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eGPU\u7684\u9759\u6001\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u8ba1\u7b97\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001GPU\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Realizing this vision faces two challenges. First, physics-based ray tracing (RT), the standard tool for network planning and coverage modeling, becomes computationally prohibitive for multi-band and multi-directional analysis over large areas. Second, current 5G systems rely on inter-frequency measurement gaps for carrier aggregation and beam management, which reduce throughput, increase latency, and scale poorly as bands and beams proliferate. These limitations motivate a data-driven approach to infer high-frequency characteristics from low-frequency observations. This work proposes CommUNext, a unified deep learning framework for cross-band, multi-directional signal strength (SS) prediction. The framework leverages low-frequency coverage data and crowd-aided partial measurements at the target band to generate high-fidelity FR3 predictions. Two complementary architectures are introduced: Full CommUNext, which substitutes costly RT simulations for large-scale offline modeling, and Partial CommUNext, which reconstructs incomplete low-frequency maps to mitigate measurement gaps in real-time operation.

In the weighted Directed Tree Augmentation Problem (WDTAP), we are given an oriented tree $T = (V,A)$ and a set of directed links $L \\subseteq V \\times V$ with positive costs. The goal is to select a minimum cost set of links which enters each fundamental dicut of $T$ (cuts with one leaving and no entering tree arc). WDTAP captures the problem of covering a cross-free set family with directed links. It can also be used to solve weighted multi $2$-TAP, in which we must cover the edges of an undirected tree at least twice. WDTAP can be approximated to within a factor of $2$ using standard techniques. We provide an improved $(1.75+ \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for WDTAP in the case where the links have bounded costs, a setting that has received significant attention for WTAP.

(STOC 2000), captures the task of computing a known function on an unknown input when each input variable can only be revealed by paying an associated cost. The goal is to design a query strategy that determines the function's value while minimizing the total cost incurred. However, all prior work in this model assumes complete advance knowledge of the query costs -- an assumption that fails in many realistic settings.\n  We introduce a variant of the priced query model that explicitly handles *unknown* variable costs. We prove a separation from the traditional priced query model, showing that uncertainty in variable costs imposes an unavoidable overhead for every query strategy. Despite this, we design strategies that essentially match our lower bound and are competitive with the best cost-aware strategies for arbitrary Boolean functions.

This paper presents IMDMR (Intelligent Multi-Dimensional Memory Retrieval), a novel system that addresses these limitations through a multi-dimensional search architecture. Unlike existing memory systems that rely on single-dimensional approaches, IMDMR leverages six distinct memory dimensions-semantic, entity, category, intent, context, and temporal-to provide comprehensive memory retrieval capabilities. Our system incorporates intelligent query processing with dynamic strategy selection, cross-memory entity resolution, and advanced memory integration techniques. Through comprehensive evaluation against five baseline systems including LangChain RAG, LlamaIndex, MemGPT, and spaCy + RAG, IMDMR achieves a 3.8x improvement in overall performance (0.792 vs 0.207 for the best baseline). We present both simulated (0.314) and production (0.792) implementations, demonstrating the importance of real technology integration while maintaining superiority over all baseline systems. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-dimensional search, with the full system outperforming individual dimension approaches by 23.3%. Query-type analysis reveals superior performance across all categories, particularly for preferences/interests (0.630) and goals/aspirations (0.630) queries. Comprehensive visualizations and statistical analysis confirm the significance of these improvements with p < 0.001 across all metrics.

AoI is a key metric for evaluating the freshness of status updates in IoT networks, and its optimization is crucial for ensuring the performance of time-critical applications. To facilitate analysis and gain useful insights, we consider a representative scenario, where an IoT device harvests energy from a base station (BS) equipped with a PA and transmits data packets to it. The IoT device harvests energy via the PA until its capacitor is fully charged, then transmits status updates using all stored energy. We derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI by analyzing the capacitor charging time, transmission success probability, and inter-arrival time of successful updates. To minimize the average AoI, we formulate an optimization problem of PA position, and propose a one-dimensional search to solve it. The simulation results show that the optimal PA position is the one closest to the IoT device, and this conclusion can be extended to the multi-IoT devices frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scenario. The PA-based systems significantly outperform the conventional fixed-antenna systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fd\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u6982\u7387\u89c6\u8ddd\u963b\u585e\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u5e73\u5747AoI\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316AoI\u3002", "motivation": "AoI\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6982\u7387\u89c6\u8ddd\u963b\u585e\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fd\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u6790AoI\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8003\u8651\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u4ece\u914d\u5907\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u57fa\u7ad9\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u91cf\u5e76\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u5305\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u7535\u5bb9\u5145\u7535\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u8fbe\u95f4\u9694\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ef4\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6700\u4f18\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6700\u9760\u8fd1\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u8bbe\u5907FDMA\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u4f9b\u80fd\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5e74\u9f84\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u662f\u5c06\u5929\u7ebf\u9760\u8fd1\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u3002"}}

If the trees $T_i$ are sub-graphs of $G$, the tree cover is called a spanning tree cover. If these trees are HSTs, it is called an HST cover.\n  In a seminal work, Mendel and Naor [2006] showed that for any parameter $k=1,2,...$, there exists an HST cover, and a non-spanning tree cover, with stretch $O(k)$ and with $O(kn^{\\frac{1}{k}})$ trees. Abraham et al. [2020] devised a spanning version of this result, albeit with stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$. For graphs of small treewidth $t$, Gupta et al. [2004] devised an exact spanning tree cover with $O(t\\log n)$ trees, and Chang et al. [2-23] devised a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate non-spanning tree cover with $2^{(t/\u03b5)^{O(t)}}$ trees.\n  We prove a smooth tradeoff between the stretch and the number of trees for graphs with balanced recursive separators of size at most $s(n)$ or treewidth at most $t(n)$. Specifically, for any $k=1,2,...$, we provide tree covers and HST covers with stretch $O(k)$ and $O\\left(\\frac{k^2\\log n}{\\log s(n)}\\cdot s(n)^{\\frac{1}{k}}\\right)$ trees or $O(k\\log n\\cdot t(n)^{\\frac{1}{k}})$ trees, respectively. We also devise spanning tree covers with these parameters and stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$. In addition devise a spanning tree cover for general graphs with stretch $O(k\\log\\log n)$ and average overlap $O(n^{\\frac{1}{k}})$.\n  We use our tree covers to provide improved path-reporting spanners, emulators (including low-hop emulators, known also as low-hop metric spanners), distance labeling schemes and routing schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u6216\u6709\u9650\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8def\u5f84\u62a5\u544a\u7a00\u758f\u5668\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u5728\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u7a00\u758f\u5668\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u8861\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u6216\u6709\u9650\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff09\u56fe\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u5927\u5c0fs(n)\u6216\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6t(n)\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u53c2\u6570k\uff0c\u6784\u9020\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u548cHST\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6\u4e3aO(k)\uff0c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u5206\u522b\u4e3aO(k\u00b2log n/log s(n)\u00b7s(n)^{1/k})\u6216O(k log n\u00b7t(n)^{1/k})\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u9020\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u4f46\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6\u4e3aO(k log log n)\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u8861\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u9694\u7b26\u6216\u6709\u9650\u6811\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610fk\uff0c\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6O(k)\u7684\u6811\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e0es(n)^{1/k}\u6216t(n)^{1/k}\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6O(k log log n)\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6O(n^{1/k})\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6811\u8986\u76d6\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62c9\u4f38\u5ea6\u548c\u6811\u6570\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6784\u9020\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u8def\u5f84\u62a5\u544a\u7a00\u758f\u5668\u3001\u4f4e\u8df3\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u5668\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\u7b49\u56fe\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Every agent must receive exactly one resource. We study algorithmic approaches towards ensuring fairness in such settings. Minimizing the number of envious agents is known to be NP-complete (Kamiyama et al. 2021). We present two tractable approaches to deal with the computational hardness. When the agents are presented with an initial allocation of houses, we aim to refine this allocation by reallocating a bounded number of houses to reduce the number of envious agents. We show an efficient algorithm when the agents express preference for a bounded number of houses.

The information-theoretic upper bound on the download efficiency of these PIR schemes has been proved in previous studies.

For this problem, two recoloring rules have been widely studied: \\emph{single-vertex recoloring} and \\emph{Kempe chain recoloring}. In this paper, we introduce a new rule, called \\emph{color swapping}, where two adjacent vertices may exchange their colors, so that the resulting coloring remains proper, and study the computational complexity of the problem under this rule. We first establish a complexity dichotomy with respect to $k$: the problem is solvable in polynomial time for $k \\leq 2$, and is PSPACE-complete for $k \\geq 3$. We further show that the problem remains PSPACE-complete even on restricted graph classes, including bipartite graphs, split graphs, and planar graphs of bounded degree.

We study, for general (possibly non-monotone) valuations, a popular relaxation of equitability known as equitability up to one item (EQ1). An EQ1 allocation may fail to exist even with additive non-monotone valuations; for instance, when there are two agents, one valuing every item positively and the other negatively. This motivates a mild and natural assumption: all agents agree on the sign of their value for the grand bundle. Under this assumption, we prove the existence and provide an efficient algorithm for computing EQ1 allocations for two agents with general valuations. When there are more than two agents, we show the existence and polynomial-time computability of EQ1 allocations for valuation classes beyond additivity and monotonicity, in particular for (1) doubly monotone valuations and (2) submodular (resp. supermodular) valuations where the value for the grand bundle is nonnegative (resp. nonpositive) for all agents. Furthermore, we settle an open question of Bil`o et al. by showing that an EQ1 allocation always exists for nonnegative(resp. nonpositive) valuations, i.e., when every agent values each subset of items nonnegatively (resp. nonpositively). Finally, we complete the picture by showing that for general valuations with more than two agents, EQ1 allocations may not exist even when agents agree on the sign of the grand bundle, and that deciding the existence of an EQ1 allocation is computationally intractable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684EQ1\uff08equitability up to one item\uff09\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u5bf9\u603b\u7269\u54c1\u675f\u4ef7\u503c\u7b26\u53f7\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86EQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "EQ1\u662f\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u677e\u5f1b\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4f30\u503c\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0bEQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u53cc\u5355\u8c03\u3001\u5b50\u6a21/\u8d85\u6a21\u3001\u975e\u8d1f/\u975e\u6b63\u4f30\u503c\uff09\u5206\u522b\u7814\u7a76EQ1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u540c\u610f\u603b\u7269\u54c1\u675f\u4ef7\u503c\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4f30\u503c\u5b58\u5728EQ1\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u5355\u8c03\u3001\u5b50\u6a21/\u8d85\u6a21\u7b49\u7279\u5b9a\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728EQ1\u5206\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "EQ1\u5206\u914d\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4f30\u503c\u7c7b\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u4f30\u503c\u548c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0cEQ1\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u5224\u5b9a\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u96be\u89e3\u7684\u3002"}}

We first derive the jointly optimal closed form solutions for the RISs in cascade with SVD water filling (SVD WF) and uniform power allocation (UPA) precoding strategies. The optimally configured cascaded-RIS with UPA is shown to achieve performance comparable to that with the SVD WF approach, suggesting that cascaded-RISs can also aid in reducing transmitter complexity. Furthermore, the approximate ergodic capacity for UPA is derived, along with its high SNR approximation which provides multiple useful insights into the dimension and deployment of cascaded RISs.

Since its introduction in 2020, twin-width has received increasing attention and has driven research leading to notable advances in algorithmic fields, including graph theory and combinatorics. The 2023 edition of the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments (PACE) Challenge aimed to fulfill the need for a diverse and consistent public benchmark encompassing various graph structures, while also collecting state-of-the-art heuristic and exact approaches to the problem. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for efficiently computing the twin-width of graphs with arbitrary structures, comprising one exact and one heuristic approach. The proposed solutions performed strongly in the competition, with the exact algorithm achieving the best student result and ranking fourth overall.

Stage I employs contextual clustering with confidence-based exploration to learn effective configurations with logarithmic regret. Stage II adopts interval-based price selection with local Taylor approximation to estimate buyer responses and achieve sublinear regret.

While conventional OAC methods rely on analog amplitude modulation, their performance is often limited by noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, motivating the use of digital modulation schemes. This paper proposes a novel digital modulation framework optimized for computation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. The design is formulated as an additive mapping problem to determine the optimal constellation that minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) under a transmit power constraint.

The algorithm was originally introduced by Karp, Vazirani, and Vazirani [STOC 1990] for the online bipartite matching problem with one-sided vertex arrivals, where it achieves a tight approximation ratio of 1 - 1/e. It was later extended to general graphs by Goel and Tripathi [FOCS 2012]. The Ranking algorithm for general graphs is as follows: a permutation $\u03c3$ over the vertices is chosen uniformly at random. The vertices are then processed sequentially according to this order, with each vertex being matched to the first available neighbor (if any) according to the same permutation $\u03c3$.\n  While the algorithm is quite well-understood for bipartite graphs-with the approximation ratio lying between 0.696 and 0.727, its approximation ratio for general graphs remains less well characterized despite extensive efforts. Prior to this work, the best known lower bound for general graphs was 0.526 by Chan et al. [TALG 2018], improving on the approximation ratio of 0.523 by Chan et al. [SICOMP 2018]. The upper bound, however, remains the same as that for bipartite graphs.\n  In this work, we improve the approximation ratio of \\textsc{Ranking} for general graphs to 0.5469, up from 0.526. This also surpasses the best-known approximation ratio of $0.531$ by Tang et al. [JACM 2023] for the oblivious matching problem. Our approach builds on the standard primal-dual analysis. The novelty of our work lies in proving new structural properties of Ranking by introducing the notion of the backup for vertices matched by the algorithm. For a fixed permutation, a vertex's backup is its potential match if its current match is removed. This concept helps characterize the rank distribution of the match of each vertex, enabling us to eliminate certain bad events that constrained previous work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ece0.526\u63d0\u5347\u52300.5469\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u5df2\u6709\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76(0.696-0.727)\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u4ecd\u4e0d\u591f\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u4e0b\u754c\u4ec5\u4e3a0.526\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9876\u70b9\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9876\u70b9\u5339\u914d\u7684\u79e9\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u9650\u5236\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u63d0\u5347\u52300.5469\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86Tang\u7b49\u4eba0.531\u7684\u65e0\u610f\u8bc6\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5907\u4efd\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86Ranking\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u56fe\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u7a7a\u65f6\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5730\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f8\u4f4d\u5931\u51c6\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5dee\u5206\u7a7a\u65f6\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u4f20\u8f93\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u5f62\u5f0f", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DSTBC\u65b9\u6848\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u5931\u51c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e", "conclusion": "DSTBC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u540c\u6b65\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6"}}

A switch with $n$ output ports receives a stream of incoming packets. When an incoming packet is accepted by the switch, it is stored in a shared buffer of capacity $B$ common to all packets and awaits its transmission through its corresponding output port determined by its destination. Each output port transmits one packet per time unit. The problem is to find an algorithm for the switch to accept or reject a packet upon its arrival in order to maximize the total number of transmitted packets.\n  Building on the work of Kesselman et al. (STOC 2001) on split buffer sharing, Kesselman and Mansour (TCS 2004) considered the problem of online buffer sharing which models most deployed internet switches. In their work, they presented the Harmonic policy and proved that it is $(2 + \\ln n)$-competitive, which is the best known competitive ratio for this problem. The Harmonic policy unfortunately saw less practical relevance as it performs $n$ threshold checks per packets which is deemed costly in practice, especially on network switches processing multiple terabits of packets per second. While the Harmonic policy is elegant, the original proof is also rather complex and involves a lengthy matching routine along with multiple intermediary results.\n  This note presents a simplified Harmonic policy, both in terms of implementation and proof.

This work explores whether it is possible to predict Oscar nominations for screenplays using modern language models. Since no suitable dataset was available, a new one called Movie-O-Label was created by combining the MovieSum collection of movie scripts with curated Oscar records. Each screenplay was represented by its title, Wikipedia summary, and full script. Long scripts were split into overlapping text chunks and encoded with the E5 sentence em bedding model. Then, the screenplay embed dings were classified using a logistic regression model. The best results were achieved when three feature inputs related to screenplays (script, summary, and title) were combined. The best-performing model reached a macro F1 score of 0.66, a precision recall AP of 0.445 with baseline 0.19 and a ROC-AUC of 0.79.

To do so, they iteratively perform queries to an oracle, each about a chosen vertex $v$. After each such call, the oracle responds whether the target was found and if not, the searcher receives as a reply the connected component in $G-v$ which contains $x$. Additionally, each vertex $v$ may have a different query cost $c(v)$ and a different weight $w(v)$. The goal is to find the optimal querying strategy which minimizes the weighted average-case cost required to find $x$. The problem is NP-hard even for uniform weights and query costs. Inspired by the progress on the edge query variant of the problem [SODA '17], we establish a connection between searching and vertex separation.

To address this failing, we introduce a training-free representation sharpening framework that augments a document's representation with information that helps differentiate it from similar documents in the corpus. On over twenty datasets spanning multiple languages, the representation sharpening framework proves consistently superior to traditional retrieval, setting a new state-of-the-art on the BRIGHT benchmark. We show that representation sharpening is compatible with prior approaches to zero-shot dense retrieval and consistently improves their performance.

However, existing methods lack in-depth modeling when dealing with interactions that generate only auxiliary behaviors without triggering the target behavior. In fact, these weak signals contain rich latent information and can be categorized into two types: (1) positive weak signals-items that have not triggered the target behavior but exhibit frequent auxiliary interactions, reflecting users' hesitation tendencies toward these items; and (2) negative weak signals-auxiliary behaviors that result from misoperations or interaction noise, which deviate from true preferences and may cause negative transfer effects. To more effectively identify and utilize these weak signals, we propose a recommendation framework focused on weak signal learning, termed HNT. Specifically, HNT models weak signal features from two dimensions: positive and negative effects. By learning the characteristics of auxiliary behaviors that lead to target behaviors, HNT identifies similar auxiliary behaviors that did not trigger the target behavior and constructs a hesitation set of related items as weak positive samples to enhance preference modeling, thereby capturing users' latent hesitation intentions. Meanwhile, during auxiliary feature fusion, HNT incorporates latent negative transfer effect modeling to distinguish and suppress interference caused by negative representations through item similarity learning. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HNT improves HR@10 and NDCG@10 by 12.57% and 14.37%, respectively, compared to the best baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHNT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u72b9\u8c6b\u503e\u5411\u548c\u8d1f\u9762\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u8f85\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u672a\u89e6\u53d1\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5305\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u5206\u4e3a\u72b9\u8c6b\u503e\u5411\u7684\u6b63\u9762\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "HNT\u4ece\u6b63\u8d1f\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8f85\u52a9\u884c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u72b9\u8c6b\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f31\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u6291\u5236\u8d1f\u9762\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cHNT\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06HR@10\u548cNDCG@10\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e8612.57%\u548c14.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "HNT\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

A straightforward and widely studied approach to this problem is the Bottom-Left Heuristic. It consists of iteratively placing each rectangle in the given order at the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, at the leftmost of those. Due to its simplicity and good empirical performance, this heuristic is widely used in practical applications. The most efficient implementation of this heuristic was proposed by Chazelle in 1983, requiring $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n)$ space to place $n$ rectangles. However, although Chazelle's original description was largely correct, it omitted several formal details. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a critical flaw in the original runtime analysis, which, in certain cases, results in $\u03a9(n^3)$ running time. Motivated by this finding, this paper provides a rigorous and corrected presentation of the implementation, addressing the imprecise arguments and resolving the identified flaw.

Our results suggest that the \"Lost in the Middle\" effect is not present for simple factoid Q\\&A in Gemini 2.5 Flash, indicating substantial improvements in long-context retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "Gemini 2.5 Flash \u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u51fa\u73b0'\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4'\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u56de\u7b54\u9488\u5728\u5e72\u8349\u5806\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u6587\u6863\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5982\u4f55\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684'\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4'\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9488\u5728\u5e72\u8349\u5806\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30Gemini 2.5 Flash\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u6863\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "Gemini 2.5 Flash\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56de\u7b54\u9488\u5728\u5e72\u8349\u5806\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6587\u6863\u63a5\u8fd1\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u51fa\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "Gemini 2.5 Flash\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c'\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4'\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that near-field beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation.

While the variant where the paths need to be pairwise vertex-disjoint, which we call PATH PARTITION, is extensively studied, surprisingly little is known about PATH COVER. We start filling this gap by designing a linear-time algorithm for PATH COVER on trees.\n  We show that PATH COVER can be solved in polynomial time on graphs of bounded treewidth using a dynamic programming scheme. It runs in XP time $n^{t^{O(t)}}$ (where $n$ is the number of vertices and $t$ the treewidth of the input graph) or $\u03ba^{t^{O(t)}}n$ if there is an upper-bound $\u03ba$ on the solution size. A similar algorithm gives an FPT $2^{O(t\\log t)}n$ algorithm for PATH PARTITION, which can be improved to (randomized) $2^{O(t)}n$ using the Cut\\&Count technique.

This deficiency limits its evolution into a predictable engineering science. To address this, we establish a complete theoretical axiomatic basis for this problem. We propose four axioms and rigorously prove that the family of pairwise rank-Copulas is the minimal sufficient representation for minimal structural semantics. Based on this, we construct a semantic distortion metric, centered on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We then establish the core theoretical boundaries of the framework: sample complexity bounds; rate-distortion bounds; an end-to-end Service Level Agreements theorem; and a semantic source-channel separation theorem, which provides a provable Quality of Service guarantee. Finally, we validate our framework through decoupled experiments, empirically demonstrating that our core metric strictly adheres to our foundational axioms while standard perceptual metrics fail to do so.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86pairwise rank-Copulas\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eJensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7387\u5931\u771f\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aefSLA\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7d27\u6025\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f20\u8f93\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660epairwise rank-Copulas\u65cf\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eJensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7387\u5931\u771f\u8fb9\u754c\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aefSLA\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u5206\u79bb\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u6838\u5fc3\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u57fa\u7840\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u611f\u77e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u516c\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u5411\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u7a0b\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Therefore, this paper initially incorporates the FD-RIS into the CC systems and proposes the corresponding CC transmission scheme. Specifically, we first develop the signal processing model of the FD-RIS, which considers effective control of harmonic signals by leveraging the time-delay techniques. The joint distance-angle beamforming capability is then validated through its normalized beampattern. Based on this model, we then construct an FD-RIS-assisted CC system under a multi-warden scenario and derive an approximate closed-form expression for the covert constraints by considering the worst-case eavesdropping conditions and utilizing the logarithmic moment-generating function. An optimization problem is formulated which aims at maximizing the covert user's achievable rate under covert constrains by jointly designing the time delays and modulation frequencies. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iterative algorithm with assured convergence is proposed to effectively solve the time-delay and modulation frequency variables. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider three communication scenarios with varying spatial correlations between the covert user and wardens.

This long-standing question was recently resolved by Gupta et al. (2021), who gave an algorithm that achieved an $O(\\log mn)$-competitive ratio.

In particular, we show how additive/multiplicative regret bounds for the latter translate into competitiveness for the former.

A key step for CTR prediction is to learn accurate user representation to capture their interests. Generally, the interest expressed by a user is time-variant, i.e., a user activates different interests at different time. However, most previous CTR prediction methods overlook the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, resulting in what they actually learn is the mixture of the interests expressed by the user at all time, rather than the real-time interest at the certain prediction time. To capture the correlation between the activated interest and the occurrence time, in this paper we investigate users' interest evolution from the perspective of the whole time line and develop two regular patterns: periodic pattern and time-point pattern. Based on the two patterns, we propose a novel time-aware long- and short-term user interest modeling method to model users' dynamic interests at different time. Extensive experiments on public datasets as well as an industrial dataset verify the effectiveness of exploiting the two patterns and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared with other state-of-the-art ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfCTR\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCTR\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u662f\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347CTR\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Ideally, one would like to achieve low worst-case bounds on both update time and recourse.\n  One can achieve approximation $(1+\u03b5)\\ln n$ (greedy-based) or $(1+\u03b5)f$ (primal-dual-based) with worst-case update time $O(f\\log n)$ (ignoring $\u03b5$ dependencies).

While effective, existing autoregressive models face two intrinsic limitations: (1) unidirectional constraints, where causal attention restricts each token to attend only to its predecessors, hindering global semantic modeling; and (2) error accumulation, where the fixed left-to-right generation order causes prediction errors in early tokens to propagate to the predictions of subsequent token. To address these issues, we propose LLaDA-Rec, a discrete diffusion framework that reformulates recommendation as parallel semantic ID generation. By combining bidirectional attention with the adaptive generation order, the approach models inter-item and intra-item dependencies more effectively and alleviates error accumulation. Specifically, our approach comprises three key designs: (1) a parallel tokenization scheme that produces semantic IDs for bidirectional modeling, addressing the mismatch between residual quantization and bidirectional architectures; (2) two masking mechanisms at the user-history and next-item levels to capture both inter-item sequential dependencies and intra-item semantic relationships; and (3) an adapted beam search strategy for adaptive-order discrete diffusion decoding, resolving the incompatibility of standard beam search with diffusion-based generation.

While recent advances leverage Large Language Model (LLM) for sequential modeling, existing LLM-based approaches face two key limitations: (i) strong reliance on the contextual completeness of user histories, resulting in poor performance on out-of-history (OOH) scenarios; (ii) limited scalability, due to the restricted context window of LLMs, which limits their ability to access and process a large number of candidate POIs. To address these challenges, we propose Tool4POI, a novel tool-augmented framework that enables LLMs to perform open-set POI recommendation through external retrieval and reasoning. Tool4POI consists of three key modules: preference extraction module, multi-turn candidate retrieval module, and reranking module, which together summarize long-term user interests, interact with external tools to retrieve relevant POIs, and refine final recommendations based on recent behaviors. Unlike existing methods, Tool4POI requires no task-specific fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf LLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that Tool4POI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 40% accuracy on challenging OOH scenarios where existing methods fail, and delivering average improvements of 20% and 30% on Acc@5 and Acc@10, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Tool4POI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3a\u7684LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3POI\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684POI\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a(1) \u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u5916\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff1b(2) \u53d7\u9650\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u5019\u9009POI\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u504f\u597d\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u603b\u7ed3\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5019\u9009\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173POI\uff0c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd1\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTool4POI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5386\u53f2\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523040%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728Acc@5\u548cAcc@10\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534720%\u548c30%\u3002", "conclusion": "Tool4POI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728POI\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u63a8\u8350\u573a\u666f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Click data has been widely used as a low-cost alternative, and with recent advances in large language models (LLMs), LLM-based relevance annotation has emerged as another promising annotation. This paper investigates whether LLM annotations can replace click data for learning to rank (LTR) by conducting a comprehensive comparison across multiple dimensions. Experiments on both a public dataset, TianGong-ST, and an industrial dataset, Baidu-Click, show that click-supervised models perform better on high-frequency queries, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective on medium- and low-frequency queries. Further analysis shows that click-supervised models are better at capturing document-level signals such as authority or quality, while LLM annotation-supervised models are more effective at modeling semantic matching between queries and documents and at distinguishing relevant from non-relevant documents. Motivated by these observations, we explore two training strategies -- data scheduling and frequency-aware multi-objective learning -- that integrate both supervision signals. Both approaches enhance ranking performance across queries at all frequency levels, with the latter being more effective.

This work investigates the performance of five LLMs in generating RAG-based responses to medicine-related queries. Our contributions are three-fold: i) the creation of a benchmark dataset using consumer medicine information documents from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), where headings are repurposed as natural language questions, ii) the retrieval of PubMed abstracts using TGA headings, stratified across multiple publication years, to enable controlled temporal evaluation of outdated evidence, and iii) a comparative analysis of the frequency and impact of outdated or contradictory content on model-generated responses, assessing how LLMs integrate and reconcile temporally inconsistent information. Our findings show that contradictions between highly similar abstracts do, in fact, degrade performance, leading to inconsistencies and reduced factual accuracy in model answers.

Existing recommendation unlearning methods, while capable of removing target data influence, suffer from inefficient unlearning speed and degraded performance, failing to meet real-time unlearning demands. Considering the ranking-oriented nature of recommendation systems, we present unranking, the process of reducing the ranking positions of target items while ensuring the formal guarantees of recommendation unlearning. To achieve efficient unranking, we propose Learning to Fast Unrank in Collaborative Filtering Recommendation (L2UnRank), which operates through three key stages: (a) identifying the influenced scope via interaction-based p-hop propagation, (b) computing structural and semantic influences for entities within this scope, and (c) performing efficient, ranking-aware parameter updates guided by influence information. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate L2UnRank's model-agnostic nature, achieving state-of-the-art unranking effectiveness and maintaining recommendation quality comparable to retraining, while also delivering a 50x speedup over existing methods.

However, training such models from scratch is both computationally expensive and yields diminishing returns once convergence is reached. To remedy these challenges, we propose ReFiT, a new framework that integrates Reinforcement learning (RL)-based Fine-Tuning into diffusion-based recommender systems. In contrast to prior RL approaches for diffusion models depending on external reward models, ReFiT adopts a task-aligned design: it formulates the denoising trajectory as a Markov decision process (MDP) and incorporates a collaborative signal-aware reward function that directly reflects recommendation quality. By tightly coupling the MDP structure with this reward signal, ReFiT empowers the RL agent to exploit high-order connectivity for fine-grained optimization, while avoiding the noisy or uninformative feedback common in naive reward designs. Leveraging policy gradient optimization, ReFiT maximizes exact log-likelihood of observed interactions, thereby enabling effective post hoc fine-tuning of diffusion recommenders. Comprehensive experiments on wide-ranging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed ReFiT framework (a) exhibits substantial performance gains over strong competitors (up to 36.3% on sequential recommendation), (b) demonstrates strong efficiency with linear complexity in the number of users or items, and (c) generalizes well across multiple diffusion-based recommendation scenarios.

Previous studies have attempted to identify noisy samples through their diverged data patterns, such as higher loss values, and mitigate their influence through sample dropping or reweighting. However, we observed that noisy samples and hard samples display similar patterns, leading to hard-noisy confusion issue. Such confusion is problematic as hard samples are vital for modeling user preferences. To solve this problem, we propose LLMHNI framework, leveraging two auxiliary user-item relevance signals generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to differentiate hard and noisy samples. LLMHNI obtains user-item semantic relevance from LLM-encoded embeddings, which is used in negative sampling to select hard negatives while filtering out noisy false negatives. An objective alignment strategy is proposed to project LLM-encoded embeddings, originally for general language tasks, into a representation space optimized for user-item relevance modeling. LLMHNI also exploits LLM-inferred logical relevance within user-item interactions to identify hard and noisy samples. These LLM-inferred interactions are integrated into the interaction graph and guide denoising with cross-graph contrastive alignment. To eliminate the impact of unreliable interactions induced by LLM hallucination, we propose a graph contrastive learning strategy that aligns representations from randomly edge-dropped views to suppress unreliable edges. Empirical results demonstrate that LLMHNI significantly improves denoising and recommendation performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u533a\u5206\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9690\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u9762\u4e34\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u548c\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u786c\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5c06LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7528\u6237-\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5229\u7528LLM\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8fb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eLLMHNI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMHNI\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u786c\u566a\u58f0\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Each memory is a time-semantic-relational entity-a structure that simultaneously encodes when an event occurred, what it means, and how it connects to other events. Built initially atop PostgreSQL with pgvector extensions, MemoriesDB combines the properties of a time-series datastore, a vector database, and a graph system within a single append-only schema. Each memory is represented as a vertex uniquely labeled by its microsecond timestamp and accompanied by low- and high-dimensional normalized embeddings that capture semantic context. Directed edges between memories form labeled relations with per-edge metadata, enabling multiple contextual links between the same vertices. Together these constructs form a time-indexed stack of temporal-semantic surfaces, where edges project as directional arrows in a 1+1-dimensional similarity field, tracing the evolution of meaning through time while maintaining cross-temporal coherence. This formulation supports efficient time-bounded retrieval, hybrid semantic search, and lightweight structural reasoning in a single query path. A working prototype demonstrates scalable recall and contextual reinforcement using standard relational infrastructure, and we discuss extensions toward a columnar backend, distributed clustering, and emergent topic modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemoriesDB\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6570\u636e\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u907f\u514d\u957f\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4-\u8bed\u4e49-\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u53bb\u76f8\u5e72\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePostgreSQL\u548cpgvector\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ec5\u8ffd\u52a0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5e26\u5fae\u79d2\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u7684\u9876\u70b9\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f4e\u7ef4\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u5411\u8fb9\u5f62\u6210\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u539f\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u754c\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MemoriesDB\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5411\u5217\u5f0f\u540e\u7aef\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u4e3b\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
