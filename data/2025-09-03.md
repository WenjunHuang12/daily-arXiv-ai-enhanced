### [1] [Efficient Computation of Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor Queries (Full Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00173)
*Shahiduz Zaman,Tanzima Hashem,Sukarna Barua*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN)查询，在用户现有行程中寻找最佳聚会POI，通过三种剪枝技术优化搜索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人日程繁忙，需要在日常行程中安排聚会活动，但传统方法无法有效结合用户现有行程路径来寻找最佳聚会地点

Method: 提出T-GNN查询类型，定义行程开销距离概念，开发三种剪枝技术减少POI搜索空间，设计实时处理算法

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法的高效性能，能够快速找到最优聚会POI和绕行位置

Conclusion: T-GNN查询有效解决了在用户现有行程中安排聚会的问题，提出的优化技术显著提高了查询处理效率

Abstract: In recent years, organizing group meetups for entertainment or other
necessities has gained significant importance, especially given the busy nature
of daily schedules. People often combine multiple activities, such as dropping
kids off at school, commuting to work, and grocery shopping, while seeking
opportunities to meet others. To address this need, we propose a novel query
type, the Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN) query, which identifies the
optimal meetup Point of Interest (POI) that aligns with users' existing trips.
An individual trip consists of a sequence of locations, allowing users the
flexibility to detour to the meetup POI at any location within the sequence,
known as a detour location. Given a set of trips for the users, the query
identifies the optimal meetup POI (e.g., restaurants or movie theaters) and
detour locations from each user's trip that minimize the total trip overhead
distance. The trip overhead distance refers to the additional distance a user
must travel to visit the meetup POI before returning to the next location in
their trip. The sum of these overhead distances for all users constitutes the
total trip overhead distance. The computation time for processing T-GNN queries
increases with the number of POIs. To address this, we introduce three
techniques to prune the POIs that cannot contribute to the optimal solution,
and thus refine the search space. We also develop an efficient approach for
processing T-GNN queries in real-time. Extensive experiments validate the
performance of the proposed algorithm.

### [2] [SABER: A SQL-Compatible Semantic Document Processing System Based on Extended Relational Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00277)
*Changjae Lee,Zhuoyue Zhao,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了SABER语义代数，为基于大语言模型的语义数据处理系统提供统一的代数基础，支持逻辑计划构建、优化和形式化正确性保证，并兼容SQL语法实现结构化/非结构化混合数据处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义数据处理系统缺乏统一的代数基础，导致查询难以组合、推理和优化，需要建立标准化的语义代数框架。

Method: 提出SABER语义代数，基于扩展关系代数，支持语义操作的逻辑计划构建和优化，并通过SQL兼容语法实现混合数据处理。

Result: SABER能够为现有语义数据处理系统提供统一接口，有效混合匹配不同系统的语义兼容算子实现，增强社区贡献的适用性。

Conclusion: SABER语义代数为解决语义数据处理系统的代数基础问题提供了可行方案，支持统一的逻辑计划构建和优化，具有重要的理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The emergence of large-language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of
semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against
unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified
algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and
optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on
Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations'
logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We
further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it
natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we
showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so
that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator
implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for
community contributions.

### [3] [Illuminating Patterns of Divergence: DataDios SmartDiff for Large-Scale Data Difference Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00293)
*Aryan Poduri,Yashwant Tailor*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SmartDiff是一个统一的数据差异比较系统，通过模式感知映射、类型特定比较器和并行执行，能够处理模式漂移和异构数据类型，在准确性和效率上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据差异比较工具在处理模式漂移、异构类型和可解释性方面存在不足，无法满足数据工程工作流对可靠差异比较的需求。

Method: 结合模式感知映射、类型特定比较器和并行执行，采用LLM辅助的标注流水线生成确定性、模式有效的多标签解释，使用检索增强和约束解码技术。

Result: 在百万行数据集上达到95%以上的精确率和召回率，运行速度快30-40%，内存使用减少30-50%，用户研究中根因分析时间从10小时缩短至12分钟。

Conclusion: SmartDiff在迁移验证、回归测试、合规审计和持续数据质量监控方面具有重要应用价值，展示了在数据差异比较领域的实用性。

Abstract: Data engineering workflows require reliable differencing across files,
databases, and query outputs, yet existing tools falter under schema drift,
heterogeneous types, and limited explainability. SmartDiff is a unified system
that combines schema-aware mapping, type-specific comparators, and parallel
execution. It aligns evolving schemas, compares structured and semi-structured
data (strings, numbers, dates, JSON/XML), and clusters results with labels that
explain how and why differences occur. On multi-million-row datasets, SmartDiff
achieves over 95 percent precision and recall, runs 30 to 40 percent faster,
and uses 30 to 50 percent less memory than baselines; in user studies, it
reduces root-cause analysis time from 10 hours to 12 minutes. An LLM-assisted
labeling pipeline produces deterministic, schema-valid multilabel explanations
using retrieval augmentation and constrained decoding; ablations show further
gains in label accuracy and time to diagnosis over rules-only baselines. These
results indicate SmartDiff's utility for migration validation, regression
testing, compliance auditing, and continuous data quality monitoring. Index
Terms: data differencing, schema evolution, data quality, parallel processing,
clustering, explainable validation, big data

*Fuheng Zhao,Jiayue Chen,Yiming Pan,Tahseen Rabbani,Divyakant Agrawal,Amr El Abbadi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了LLM ORDER BY操作符作为逻辑抽象，并在统一评估框架下研究其物理实现。实验表明没有单一最优方法，效果取决于查询特性和数据。作者引入了三种新设计：基于一致性的批处理大小策略、用于成对排序的多数投票机制，以及适配LLM的双向外部分并排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在数据处理系统中的广泛应用，需要研究如何有效地利用LLM实现排序操作，但目前缺乏系统性的评估框架和优化的实现方法。

Method: 提出了三种新的物理实现方法：1）基于一致性的批处理大小确定策略；2）多数投票机制来增强成对比较的准确性；3）适配LLM的双向外部分并排序算法。建立了统一的评估框架进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明：基于一致性的方法能有效确定值基方法的批处理大小；多数投票机制在GPT-4o上持续增强成对比较性能；外部分并排序在多个数据集和模型上实现了高精度-效率权衡。发现了计算成本与排序质量之间的对数线性缩放关系。

Conclusion: 本研究为LLM驱动的数据系统提供了首个原则性成本模型的基础，证明了不同排序方法的适用性取决于具体场景，为构建高效的LLM数据操作符提供了重要指导。

Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its
physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments
show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness
depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an
agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise
sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive
experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch
size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently
strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves
high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further
observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality,
offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data
systems.

### [5] [CRouting: Reducing Expensive Distance Calls in Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00365)
*Zhenxin Li,Shuibing He,Jiahao Guo,Xuechen Zhang,Xian-He Sun,Gang Chen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: CRouting是一种新的路由策略，通过利用高维向量的角度分布来绕过不必要的距离计算，加速图基近似最近邻搜索算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图基ANNS算法虽然高效准确，但高维空间中的重复距离计算是主要时间成本，需要优化。

Method: 提出CRouting路由策略，作为插件优化现有图基搜索，通过角度分布分析减少不必要的距离计算。

Result: 实验显示CRouting减少距离计算达41.5%，在HNSW和NSG上提升查询速度1.48倍。

Conclusion: CRouting能有效加速图基ANNS算法，代码已开源，可作为现有方法的优化插件。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is a crucial problem in
information retrieval and AI applications. Recently, there has been a surge of
interest in graph-based ANNS algorithms due to their superior efficiency and
accuracy. However, the repeated computation of distances in high-dimensional
spaces constitutes the primary time cost of graph-based methods. To accelerate
the search, we propose a novel routing strategy named CRouting, which bypasses
unnecessary distance computations by exploiting the angle distributions of
high-dimensional vectors. CRouting is designed as a plugin to optimize existing
graph-based search with minimal code modifications. Our experiments show that
CRouting reduces the number of distance computations by up to 41.5% and boosts
queries per second by up to 1.48$\times$ on two predominant graph indexes, HNSW
and NSG. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/ISCS-ZJU/CRouting.

### [6] [BPI: A Novel Efficient and Reliable Search Structure for Hybrid Storage Blockchain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00480)
*Xinkui Zhao,Rengrong Xiong,Guanjie Cheng,Xinhao Jin,Shawn Shi,Xiubo Liang,Gongsheng Yuan,Xiaoye Miao,Jianwei Yin,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: BPI是一个轻量级框架，通过"Articulated Search"查询模式和验证模型，解决混合存储区块链中关键词查询的正确性和效率问题，显著提升搜索性能并降低更新成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合存储解决方案虽然缓解了区块链数据存储瓶颈，但依赖中心化存储服务提供商(SPs)存在查询正确性问题。现有认证数据结构(ADS)只能验证单个查询结果的存在性，无法防止SPs遗漏有效结果。

Method: 提出BPI轻量级框架，采用专门为区块链环境设计的"Articulated Search"查询模式，结合一套验证模型来确保搜索结果包含所有有效内容，同时保持低开销。

Result: 实验评估表明，BPI框架在区块链关键词搜索中表现出卓越的可扩展性和性能，超越了EthMB+和主流混合存储区块链中常用的最先进搜索数据库。

Conclusion: BPI通过创新的查询模式和验证机制，有效解决了混合存储区块链中的查询完整性问题，在保证低开销的同时显著提升了搜索效率和正确性。

Abstract: Hybrid storage solutions have emerged as potent strategies to alleviate the
data storage bottlenecks prevalent in blockchain systems. These solutions
harness off-chain Storage Services Providers (SPs) in conjunction with
Authenticated Data Structures (ADS) to ensure data integrity and accuracy.
Despite these advancements, the reliance on centralized SPs raises concerns
about query correctness. Although ADS can verify the existence of individual
query results, they fall short of preventing SPs from omitting valid results.
  In this paper, we delineate the fundamental distinctions between data search
in blockchains and traditional database systems. Drawing upon these insights,
we introduce BPI, a lightweight framework that enables efficient keyword
queries and maintenance with low overhead. We propose "Articulated Search", a
query pattern specifically designed for blockchain environments that enhances
search efficiency while significantly reducing costs during data user updates.
Furthermore, BPI employs a suite of validation models to ensure the inclusion
of all valid content in search results while maintaining low overhead.
  Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BPI framework
achieves outstanding scalability and performance in keyword searches within
blockchain, surpassing EthMB+ and state of the art search databases commonly
used in mainstream hybrid storage blockchains (HSB).

*Saumya Chaturvedi,Aman Chadha,Laurent Bindschaedler*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SQL-of-Thought是一个多智能体框架，通过思维链和上下文学习将自然语言查询转换为SQL查询，在Spider数据集上取得了最先进的结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言到SQL查询转换的挑战，提高数据库和大规模应用的可访问性，探索如何利用上下文学习和思维链来开发强大的文本到SQL系统

Method: 提出多智能体框架SQL-of-Thought，将Text2SQL任务分解为模式链接、子问题识别、查询计划生成、SQL生成和引导式修正循环，引入基于上下文学习的分类法引导动态错误修正

Result: 在Spider数据集及其变体上取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: SQL-of-Thought通过结合引导式错误分类和基于推理的查询规划，为文本到SQL转换提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Converting natural language queries into SQL queries is a crucial challenge
in both industry and academia, aiming to increase access to databases and
large-scale applications. This work examines how in-context learning and
chain-of-thought can be utilized to develop a robust solution for text-to-SQL
systems. We propose SQL-of-Thought: a multi-agent framework that decomposes the
Text2SQL task into schema linking, subproblem identification, query plan
generation, SQL generation, and a guided correction loop. Unlike prior systems
that rely only on execution-based static correction, we introduce
taxonomy-guided dynamic error modification informed by in-context learning.
SQL-of-Thought achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider dataset and its
variants, combining guided error taxonomy with reasoning-based query planning.

### [8] [Near-Duplicate Text Alignment under Weighted Jaccard Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00627)
*Yuheng Zhang,Miao Qiao,Zhencan Peng,Dong Deng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: MONO是一种基于一致性加权采样的近重复文本对齐方法，支持加权Jaccard相似度，在索引构建时间、索引大小和查询延迟方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法缺乏准确性保证且需要大量难以调优的参数，现有min-hash方法无法处理带权重的token（如TF-IDF），限制了在实际场景中的应用

Method: 采用一致性加权采样技术，通过将子序列按其min-hash分组，为每个查询找到与其草图相似的所有草图，支持加权Jaccard相似度计算

Result: MONO在索引构建时间上比现有技术快26倍，索引大小减少30%，查询延迟提高3倍，且具有良好的可扩展性

Conclusion: MONO在哈希框架内达到最优性能，解决了加权token场景下的近重复文本对齐问题，为实际应用提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Near-duplicate text alignment is the task of identifying, among the texts in
a corpus, all the subsequences (substrings) that are similar to a given query.
Traditional approaches rely on seeding-extension-filtering heuristics, which
lack accuracy guarantees and require many hard-to-tune parameters. Recent
methods leverage min-hash techniques under a hash-based framework: group
subsequences by their min-hash, and for any query, find all sketches similar to
the query's sketch. These methods guarantee to report all subsequences whose
estimated unweighted Jaccard similarity with the query exceeds a user-provided
threshold and are efficient. However, they fail to account for token importance
or frequency, which limits their use in real scenarios where tokens carry
weights, such as TF-IDF. To address this, we propose MONO, an approach that
supports weighted Jaccard similarity using consistent weighted sampling. MONO
achieves optimality within the hash-based framework. For example, when token
weights are proportional to frequencies, MONO generates O(n + n log f) groups
in expectation for a text of length n, where f is the maximum token frequency.
Each group takes O(1) space and represents a few subsequences sharing the same
sampling. We prove this bound is tight: any algorithm must produce Omega(n + n
log f) groups in expectation in the worst case. Experiments show that MONO
outperforms the state of the art by up to 26x in index construction time,
reduces index size by up to 30 percent, and improves query latency by up to 3x,
while scaling well.

### [9] [Diverse Unionable Tuple Search: Novelty-Driven Discovery in Data Lakes [Technical Report]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01012)
*Aamod Khatiwada,Roee Shraga,Renée J. Miller*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出了DUST算法，通过聚类方法解决数据湖中联合表的多样性问题，避免返回与查询表过于相似的冗余结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联合表搜索方法可能返回与查询表几乎相同的冗余表，缺乏新信息。需要寻找既联合又多样化的表来提供更多价值。

Method: 提出了基于聚类的DUST算法，使用新颖的嵌入模型来表示可联合元组，该模型在表示可联合元组时比其他模型性能提升至少15%。

Result: DUST算法比最高效的多样化基线快6倍以上，在多样化可联合元组方面比现有算法更有效。

Conclusion: DUST算法有效解决了数据湖中联合表搜索的多样性问题，提供了更高效和有效的多样化解决方案。

Abstract: Unionable table search techniques input a query table from a user and search
for data lake tables that can contribute additional rows to the query table.
The definition of unionability is generally based on similarity measures which
may include similarity between columns (e.g., value overlap or semantic
similarity of the values in the columns) or tables (e.g., similarity of table
embeddings). Due to this and the large redundancy in many data lakes (which can
contain many copies and versions of the same table), the most unionable tables
may be identical or nearly identical to the query table and may contain little
new information. Hence, we introduce the problem of identifying unionable
tuples from a data lake that are diverse with respect to the tuples already
present in a query table. We perform an extensive experimental analysis of
well-known diversity algorithms applied to this novel problem and identify a
gap that we address with a novel, clustering-based tuple diversity algorithm
called DUST. DUST uses a novel embedding model to represent unionable tuples
that outperforms other tuple representation models by at least 15 % when
representing unionable tuples. Using real data lake benchmarks, we show that
our diversification algorithm is more than six times faster than the most
efficient diversification baseline. We also show that it is more effective in
diversifying unionable tuples than existing diversification algorithms.

### [10] [Disentangling the schema turn: Restoring the information base to conceptual modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01617)
*Chris Partridge,Andrew Mitchell,Sergio de Cesare,Oscar Xiberta Soto*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文批判了计算机科学概念建模中过度关注概念模式而忽视信息基础的"模式转向"现象，提出了包含模式和基础的综合建模方法，展示了更广泛的概念建模实践可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流概念建模实践过度偏向概念模式而完全忽视信息基础，这种"模式转向"限制了建模实践的多样性和自动化程度，需要重新审视这种偏见的形成并探索更全面的建模方法。

Method: 通过分析概念建模的历史演变，展示模式转向并非根本性选择；利用现代技术实现包含模式和基础的综合建模方法；以bCLEARer为例说明基于流水线的新建模技术。

Result: 证明了模式转向只是暂时的进化弯路，现代技术支持更全面的概念建模方法；展示了概念建模实践空间比当前假设的更广泛；提出了基于流水线的新建模技术实现路径。

Conclusion: 概念建模不应局限于模式中心的单一方法，而应采用包含信息基础的综合方法，这能实现更自动化和经验驱动的建模实践，模式转向的完全排除信息基础做法可能只是暂时的进化偏差。

Abstract: If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual
modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema
completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is
often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are
crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost
universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this
paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual
modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is
not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an
inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables
more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more
generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than
currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the
implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new
pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the
schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a
temporary evolutionary detour.

*Soon Hwang,Junhyeok Park,Junghyun Ryu,Seonghoon Ahn,Jeoungahn Park,Jeongjin Lee,Soonyeal Yang,Jungki Noh,Woosuk Chung,Hoshik Kim,Youngjae Kim*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: OASIS是一个新型计算对象存储系统，解决了现有COS系统在输出格式灵活性、操作符支持和存储层次优化方面的局限性，在Spark框架中实现了32.7%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算对象存储系统(COS)存在三个主要问题：输出格式限制、操作符支持有限、缺乏深度存储层次优化设计，限制了其在HPC环境中复杂分析任务的有效性。

Method: 提出OASIS系统，具有：(1)灵活的输出格式支持(包括Arrow列式布局)；(2)支持复杂操作符(聚合、排序等)和数组感知表达式；(3)基于操作符特性和数据移动成本的动态执行路径选择。

Result: 在Spark框架中集成OASIS原型，使用真实科学查询进行评估，相比现有COS系统配置的Spark实现了最高32.7%的性能提升。

Conclusion: OASIS通过解决现有COS系统的核心限制，为HPC环境中的大规模数据分析提供了更高效、灵活的计算存储解决方案。

Abstract: Computation-Enabled Object Storage (COS) systems, such as MinIO and Ceph,
have recently emerged as promising storage solutions for post hoc, SQL-based
analysis on large-scale datasets in High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments. By supporting object-granular layouts, COS facilitates
column-oriented access and supports in-storage execution of data reduction
operators, such as filters, close to where the data resides. Despite growing
interest and adoption, existing COS systems exhibit several fundamental
limitations that hinder their effectiveness. First, they impose rigid
constraints on output data formats, limiting flexibility and interoperability.
Second, they support offloading for only a narrow set of operators and
expressions, restricting their applicability to more complex analytical tasks.
Third--and perhaps most critically--they fail to incorporate design strategies
that enable compute offloading optimized for the characteristics of deep
storage hierarchies. To address these challenges, this paper proposes OASIS, a
novel COS system that features: (i) flexible and interoperable output delivery
through diverse formats, including columnar layouts such as Arrow; (ii) broad
support for complex operators (e.g., aggregate, sort) and array-aware
expressions, including element-wise predicates over array structures; and (iii)
dynamic selection of optimal execution paths across internal storage layers,
guided by operator characteristics and data movement costs. We implemented a
prototype of OASIS and integrated it into the Spark analytics framework.
Through extensive evaluation using real-world scientific queries from HPC
workflows, OASIS achieves up to a 32.7% performance improvement over Spark
configured with existing COS-based storage systems.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GeoLayer是一个地理分布式图存储框架，通过分层图架构、重叠感知的副本放置和分层路由策略，优化图副本放置和模式请求路由，显著提升响应时间和分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据的固有连通性和依赖性，以及其独特的拓扑驱动访问模式，对传统地理分布式云存储系统的数据复制和请求路由策略提出了根本性挑战。

Method: 1) 构建延迟感知的分层图架构来分解图拓扑；2) 引入重叠中心的副本放置方案；3) 使用定向热扩散模型指导数据分配；4) 开发逐步分层路由策略进行渐进式扩展检索。

Result: 相比最先进的副本放置和路由方案，GeoLayer在线图模式请求的响应时间提升了1.34-3.67倍，离线图分析性能加速了1.28-3.56倍。

Conclusion: GeoLayer通过联合优化图副本放置和模式请求路由，有效解决了地理分布式环境中图数据存储和访问的挑战，显著提升了系统性能。

Abstract: The inherent connectivity and dependency of graph-structured data, combined
with its unique topology-driven access patterns, pose fundamental challenges to
conventional data replication and request routing strategies in geo-distributed
cloud storage systems. In this paper, we propose GeoLayer, a geo-distributed
graph storage framework that jointly optimizes graph replica placement and
pattern request routing. We first construct a latency-aware layered graph
architecture that decomposes the graph topology into multiple layers, aiming to
reduce the decision space and computational complexity of the optimization
problem, while mitigating the impact of network heterogeneity in
geo-distributed environments. Building on the layered graph, we introduce an
overlap-centric replica placement scheme to accommodate the diversity of graph
pattern accesses, along with a directed heat diffusion model that captures heat
conduction and superposition effects to guide data allocation. For request
routing, we develop a stepwise layered routing strategy that performs
progressive expansion over the layered graph to efficiently retrieve the
required data. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art
replica placement and routing schemes, GeoLayer achieves a 1.34x - 3.67x
improvement in response times for online graph pattern requests and a 1.28x -
3.56x speedup in offline graph analysis performance.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Halo是一个针对多智能体LLM工作流的批处理优化系统，通过查询计划DAG表示、计算共享和运行时优化，显著提升GPU利用率和处理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务引擎只优化单个调用，多智能体框架缺乏系统级性能规划，导致重复提示、上下文重叠和并发执行造成大量冗余和GPU利用率低下

Method: 将工作流表示为结构化查询计划DAG，构建批处理查询的合并图以暴露共享计算，基于成本模型进行计划级优化，运行时集成自适应批处理、KV缓存共享和迁移等技术

Result: 在六个基准测试中，Halo实现了批量推理18.6倍加速和在线服务4.7倍吞吐量提升，可扩展到数万个查询和复杂图的工作负载，且不损害输出质量

Conclusion: 通过统一查询优化与LLM服务，Halo实现了数据分析与决策应用中高效的多智能体工作流

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic workflows combine multi-step
reasoning, tool use, and collaboration across multiple specialized agents.
Existing LLM serving engines optimize indi- vidual calls in isolation, while
multi-agent frameworks focus on orchestration without system-level performance
planning. As a result, repeated prompts, overlapping contexts, and concurrent
ex- ecutions create substantial redundancy and poor GPU utilization, especially
in batch analytics scenarios. We introduce Halo, a system that brings batch
query processing and optimization into agentic LLM workflows. Halo represents
each workflow as a structured query plan DAG and constructs a consoli- dated
graph for batched queries that exposes shared computation. Guided by a cost
model that jointly considers prefill and decode costs, cache reuse, and GPU
placement, Halo performs plan-level op- timization to minimize redundant
execution. Its runtime integrates adaptive batching, KV-cache sharing and
migration, along with compute-communication overlap to maximize hardware
efficiency. Evaluation across six benchmarks shows that Halo achieves up to
18.6x speedup for batch inference and 4.7x throughput im- provement under
online serving, scaling to workloads of tens of thousands of queries and
complex graphs. These gains are achieved without compromising output quality.
By unifying query optimiza- tion with LLM serving, Halo enables efficient
agentic workflows in data analytics and decision-making applications.

Abstract: The growing demand for data-driven decision-making has created an urgent need
for data agents that can integrate structured and unstructured data for
analysis. While data agents show promise for enabling users to perform complex
analytics tasks, this field still suffers from three critical limitations:
first, comprehensive data agent benchmarks remain absent due to the difficulty
of designing test cases that evaluate agents' abilities across multi-source
analytical tasks; second, constructing reliable test cases that combine
structured and unstructured data remains costly and prohibitively complex;
third, existing benchmarks exhibit limited adaptability and generalizability,
resulting in narrow evaluation scope.
  To address these challenges, we present FDABench, the first data agent
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating agents in multi-source data
analytical scenarios. Our contributions include: (i) we construct a
standardized benchmark with 2,007 diverse tasks across different data sources,
domains, difficulty levels, and task types to comprehensively evaluate data
agent performance; (ii) we design an agent-expert collaboration framework
ensuring reliable and efficient benchmark construction over heterogeneous data;
(iii) we equip FDABench with robust generalization capabilities across diverse
target systems and frameworks. We use FDABench to evaluate various data agent
systems, revealing that each system exhibits distinct advantages and
limitations regarding response quality, accuracy, latency, and token cost.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨传统机器学习和大型语言模型（如Llama 3.1）如何基于行为模式评估精神病患者，特别是在急救情况下提供诊断评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神障碍患者由于缺乏明显症状而经常被误判和诊断不足，在急救情况下识别精神问题具有挑战性但至关重要。

Method: 从德国救援站收集急诊精神病患者数据，使用包括Llama 3.1在内的多种机器学习模型分析患者行为模式。

Result: 研究评估了这些模型的预测能力是否能作为识别精神障碍患者的有效工具。

Conclusion: 机器学习和大语言模型有望成为急救情况下精神障碍诊断的辅助工具。

Abstract: Mental disorders are clinically significant patterns of behavior that are
associated with stress and/or impairment in social, occupational, or family
activities. People suffering from such disorders are often misjudged and poorly
diagnosed due to a lack of visible symptoms compared to other health
complications. During emergency situations, identifying psychiatric issues is
that's why challenging but highly required to save patients. In this paper, we
have conducted research on how traditional machine learning and large language
models (LLM) can assess these psychiatric patients based on their behavioral
patterns to provide a diagnostic assessment. Data from emergency psychiatric
patients were collected from a rescue station in Germany. Various machine
learning models, including Llama 3.1, were used with rescue patient data to
assess if the predictive capabilities of the models can serve as an efficient
tool for identifying patients with unhealthy mental disorders, especially in
rescue cases.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过在模型导出时使用衰减分层学习率进行微调来扰动模型参数的方法，有效破坏数据嵌入攻击同时保持任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖训练模型存在严重的隐私风险，攻击者可以通过模型参数嵌入或多任务学习窃取敏感医疗数据，需要有效的防御措施

Method: 在模型导出时使用衰减分层学习率进行微调，扰动模型参数以破坏嵌入的数据表示，同时保持原始任务的性能

Result: 在DermaMNIST、ChestMNIST和MIMIC-CXR数据集上验证，方法能保持任务性能，有效破坏最先进的窃取攻击，优于现有防御方法

Conclusion: 该方法为数据湖训练模型和集中式联邦学习提供了实用的数据泄露防御方案，但自适应攻击仍面临挑战

Abstract: Data lakes enable the training of powerful machine learning models on
sensitive, high-value medical datasets, but also introduce serious privacy
risks due to potential leakage of protected health information. Recent studies
show adversaries can exfiltrate training data by embedding latent
representations into model parameters or inducing memorization via multi-task
learning. These attacks disguise themselves as benign utility models while
enabling reconstruction of high-fidelity medical images, posing severe privacy
threats with legal and ethical implications. In this work, we propose a simple
yet effective mitigation strategy that perturbs model parameters at export time
through fine-tuning with a decaying layer-wise learning rate to corrupt
embedded data without degrading task performance. Evaluations on DermaMNIST,
ChestMNIST, and MIMIC-CXR show that our approach maintains utility task
performance, effectively disrupts state-of-the-art exfiltration attacks,
outperforms prior defenses, and renders exfiltrated data unusable for training.
Ablations and discussions on adaptive attacks highlight challenges and future
directions. Our findings offer a practical defense against data leakage in data
lake-trained models and centralized federated learning.

Motivation: 现有的低位后训练量化方法存在精度下降问题，而量化感知训练虽然提供理论解决方案但计算成本过高，需要一种既高效又能保持精度的量化方法。

Method: 采用零阶优化框架，利用前向梯度估计替代反向传播，联合学习量化权重、权重裁剪阈值和等效变换来减少量化误差和处理激活异常值。

Result: 实验证明ZeroQAT实现了后训练量化的效率，同时保持了量化感知训练的精度，为LLMs的高质量低位量化提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: ZeroQAT通过消除反向传播需求，在计算效率和量化精度之间取得了良好平衡，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了可行的量化方案。

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large
language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely
studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer
from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces
cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction
objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT)
provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs
prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address
these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT
framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the
need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory
overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover,
ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and
equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation
outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ
while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for
high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Steel casting processes are vulnerable to financial losses due to slag flow
contamination, making accurate slag flow condition detection essential. This
study introduces a novel cross-domain diagnostic method using vibration data
collected from an industrial steel foundry to identify various stages of slag
flow. A hybrid deep learning model combining one-dimensional convolutional
neural networks and long short-term memory layers is implemented, tested, and
benchmarked against a standard one-dimensional convolutional neural network.
The proposed method processes raw time-domain vibration signals from
accelerometers and evaluates performance across 16 distinct domains using a
realistic cross-domain dataset split. Results show that the hybrid
convolutional neural network and long short-term memory architecture, when
combined with root mean square preprocessing and a selective embedding data
loading strategy, achieves robust classification accuracy, outperforming
traditional models and loading techniques. The highest test accuracy of 99.10
+/- 0.30 demonstrates the method's capability for generalization and industrial
relevance. This work presents a practical and scalable solution for real-time
slag flow monitoring, contributing to improved reliability and operational
efficiency in steel manufacturing.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy
efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing
minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology
nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship

novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the
16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced

derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained
characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the
5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: A-FloPS是一种无需训练的高效扩散模型采样框架，通过重新参数化采样轨迹和自适应速度分解，在极低函数评估次数下显著提升生成质量和效率


<details>

Result: 在条件图像生成和文本到图像合成任务中，A-FloPS在样本质量和效率方面始终优于最先进的训练免费采样器。仅用5次函数评估即可实现显著更低的FID，生成更清晰、更连贯的图像

Conclusion: A-FloPS为高质量、低延迟生成建模提供了一个通用有效的解决方案，其自适应机制还能改进基于流的原生生成模型，展示了良好的通用性

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across
diverse modalities but remain computationally expensive due to their inherently
iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods
typically improve numerical solvers for the reverse-time ODE, yet their
effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their
characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on.
Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of
large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations
between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies
the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness.
Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between
weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract
Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the
self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the
matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of
singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the
probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is
found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law
distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance
calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative
method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different
models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution
characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian
process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate
the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics.
Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data
generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for
training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model
structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in
the performance of LoRA training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出UDI方法解决多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，通过顺序训练和无监督损失替代传统联合损失，实现更好的模态交互和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态联合学习会导致模态不平衡，强模态压制弱模态，限制了各模态信息和模态间交互信息的充分利用

Method: UDI（单向动态交互）策略：先训练锚定模态至收敛，然后用其学习表示通过无监督损失指导其他模态训练，动态调整模态交互

Result: 实验结果表明UDI在处理模态不平衡方面优于现有方法，在多模态学习任务中实现了性能提升

Conclusion: UDI通过放弃传统联合损失、采用顺序训练方案，有效解决了模态不平衡问题，促进了跨模态特征学习

Abstract: Multimodal learning typically utilizes multimodal joint loss to integrate
different modalities and enhance model performance. However, this joint
learning strategy can induce modality imbalance, where strong modalities
overwhelm weaker ones and limit exploitation of individual information from
each modality and the inter-modality interaction information.Existing
strategies such as dynamic loss weighting, auxiliary objectives and gradient
modulation mitigate modality imbalance based on joint loss. These methods
remain fundamentally reactive, detecting and correcting imbalance after it
arises, while leaving the competitive nature of the joint loss untouched. This
limitation drives us to explore a new strategy for multimodal imbalance
learning that does not rely on the joint loss, enabling more effective
interactions between modalities and better utilization of information from
individual modalities and their interactions. In this paper, we introduce
Unidirectional Dynamic Interaction (UDI), a novel strategy that abandons the
conventional joint loss in favor of a proactive, sequential training scheme.
UDI first trains the anchor modality to convergence, then uses its learned
representations to guide the other modality via unsupervised loss. Furthermore,
the dynamic adjustment of modality interactions allows the model to adapt to
the task at hand, ensuring that each modality contributes optimally. By
decoupling modality optimization and enabling directed information flow, UDI
prevents domination by any single modality and fosters effective cross-modal
feature learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that UDI outperforms
existing methods in handling modality imbalance, leading to performance
improvement in multimodal learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类大脑记忆巩固机制的启发，研究内部回放机制在缓解人工神经网络持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，重点关注该机制作为大脑启发框架中最有影响力的组件。

Method: 在CIFAR-100数据集上进行类增量设置实验，评估内部回放机制单独使用以及与突触智能(SI)结合的效果，使用对数似然分布、重构误差、轮廓系数和UMAP投影等分析方法。

Result: 内部回放显著减轻了遗忘现象，特别是与SI结合时效果更好，但代价是降低了初始任务准确率。分析表明内部回放增加了潜在空间中的表征重叠，可能限制了任务特异性区分。

Conclusion: 当前大脑启发方法存在局限性，需要在持续学习系统中平衡记忆保持和适应能力，为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual
learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously
learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in
the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed
by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of
prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the
most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their
framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using
the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the
effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with
Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay
significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the
cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory
stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood
distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections
reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space,
potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore
the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions
for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于物理信息神经网络(PINN)的模型，用于预测氢气在泥岩、项岩和煤矿中的吸附性能，在保持物理一致性的同时实现了高精度预测(R2=0.979)。


<details>

Conclusion: 该适应性物理信息框架通过结合物理知识和深度学习，显著提高了氢气吸附预测的准确性和可靠性，为地下氢气存储和相关应用提供了有力技术支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of hydrogen sorption in clays, shales, and coals is vital
for advancing underground hydrogen storage, natural hydrogen exploration, and
radioactive waste containment. Traditional experimental methods, while
foundational, are time-consuming, error-prone, and limited in capturing
geological heterogeneity. This study introduces an adaptive physics-informed
neural network (PINN) framework with multi-category feature engineering to
enhance hydrogen sorption prediction. The framework integrates classical
isotherm models with thermodynamic constraints to ensure physical consistency
while leveraging deep learning flexibility. A comprehensive dataset consisting
of 155 samples, which includes 50 clays, 60 shales, and 45 coals, was employed,
incorporating diverse compositional properties and experimental conditions.
Multi-category feature engineering across seven categories captured complex
sorption dynamics. The PINN employs deep residual networks with multi-head
attention, optimized via adaptive loss functions and Monte Carlo dropout for
uncertainty quantification. K-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter
optimization achieve significant accuracy (R2 = 0.979, RMSE = 0.045 mol per kg)
with 67% faster convergence despite 15-fold increased complexity. The framework
demonstrates robust lithology-specific performance across clay minerals (R2 =
0.981), shales (R2 = 0.971), and coals (R2 = 0.978), maintaining 85-91%
reliability scores. Interpretability analysis via SHAP, accumulated local
effects, and Friedman's H-statistics reveal that hydrogen adsorption capacity
dominates predictions, while 86.7% of feature pairs exhibit strong
interactions, validating the necessity of non-linear modeling approaches. This
adaptive physics-informed framework accelerates site screening and enables
risk-informed decision-making through robust uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能够有效检测空间物体的异常行为模式，为军事冲突预警提供可靠的技术手段，特别是在可解释性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity
of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and
assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and
warnings (I&W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through
analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and
procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically
significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior
(PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research
looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity.
The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional
autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network
(KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is
used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data
sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up
to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO
activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion
date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on
reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and
unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each
observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability
and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed
for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing
the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not
only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also
details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习中概率预测的普及，如何正确解释和评估预测概率的校准性成为了重要问题。校准旨在解决在只能观察到离散结果的世界中，如何评估假设连续概率的预测器。

Method: 采用统一视角，将校准视为预测器假设的世界与真实世界（由自然或贝叶斯最优预测器控制）之间的一种不可区分性。各种校准度量量化了这两类世界被特定区分器或统计度量区分开来的程度。

Result: 提出了校准作为不可区分性的统一理论框架，系统梳理了不同校准度量的定义和测量方法，为理解概率预测的质量提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 校准误差的度量本质上反映了预测假设世界与真实世界之间的可区分程度，这一统一视角有助于更好地理解和应用概率预测模型在下游决策中的价值。

Abstract: Calibration is a classical notion from the forecasting literature which aims
to address the question: how should predicted probabilities be interpreted? In
a world where we only get to observe (discrete) outcomes, how should we
evaluate a predictor that hypothesizes (continuous) probabilities over possible
outcomes? The study of calibration has seen a surge of recent interest, given
the ubiquity of probabilistic predictions in machine learning. This survey
describes recent work on the foundational questions of how to define and
measure calibration error, and what these measures mean for downstream decision
makers who wish to use the predictions to make decisions. A unifying viewpoint
that emerges is that of calibration as a form of indistinguishability, between
the world hypothesized by the predictor and the real world (governed by nature
or the Bayes optimal predictor). In this view, various calibration measures
quantify the extent to which the two worlds can be told apart by certain
classes of distinguishers or statistical measures.

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个针对合成表格数据检测的有效方法，使用datum-wise transformer架构，在AUC和准确率上比现有基线提升7个百分点，通过表格自适应组件进一步提升了7个准确率点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的兴起引发了数据真实性的担忧，但表格数据的检测一直被忽视。表格数据具有异构结构和测试时未知格式的特点，使得检测合成表格数据特别具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的datum-wise transformer架构，并加入了表格自适应组件，专门用于处理具有变量和未知模式结构的表格数据。

Result: 模型显著优于先前唯一的基线方法，AUC和准确率均提升7个百分点。表格自适应组件进一步带来了7个准确率点的提升，证明了模型的鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次提供了强有力的证据，表明在真实世界条件下检测合成表格数据不仅是可行的，而且可以以高可靠性实现。

Abstract: The rise of powerful generative models has sparked concerns over data
authenticity. While detection methods have been extensively developed for
images and text, the case of tabular data, despite its ubiquity, has been
largely overlooked. Yet, detecting synthetic tabular data is especially
challenging due to its heterogeneous structure and unseen formats at test time.
We address the underexplored task of detecting synthetic tabular data in the
wild, where tables have variable and previously unseen schemas. We introduce a
novel datum-wise transformer architecture that significantly outperforms the
only previously published baseline, improving both AUC and accuracy by 7
points. By incorporating a table-adaptation component, our model gains an
additional 7 accuracy points, demonstrating enhanced robustness. This work
provides the first strong evidence that detecting synthetic tabular data in
real-world conditions is not only feasible, but can be done with high
reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将联邦学习建模为战略系统而非单纯优化任务，提出了分析框架来区分真正提升性能的行为与仅针对指标的行为，并提供了实用检查表和算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的成功依赖于参与者在视野之外的行为，需要从战略系统角度分析规则和激励机制，以识别真正改善性能的行为与仅针对指标的行为之间的差异。

Method: 引入两个指标分别量化行为激励和集体性能损失，基于此分析操作选择的影响；总结阈值、自动切换规则和预警信号为实用检查表；提供有限审计资源分配算法和性能保证。

Result: 在不同环境下的模拟验证了框架预测的模式，所有程序可完全复现；结合定期重新校准、随机化和基于连接的警报可在实际操作变异性下稳健应用。

Conclusion: 提出了降低指标博弈激励同时维持和扩展稳定合作的设计原则和操作指南，在多个假设下运行最强，但通过技术组合可实现实际应用的稳健性。

Abstract: The success of Federated Learning depends on the actions that participants
take out of sight. We model Federated Learning not as a mere optimization task
but as a strategic system entangled with rules and incentives. From this
perspective, we present an analytical framework that makes it possible to
clearly identify where behaviors that genuinely improve performance diverge
from those that merely target metrics. We introduce two indices that
respectively quantify behavioral incentives and collective performance loss,
and we use them as the basis for consistently interpreting the impact of
operational choices such as rule design, the level of information disclosure,
evaluation methods, and aggregator switching. We further summarize thresholds,
auto-switch rules, and early warning signals into a checklist that can be
applied directly in practice, and we provide both a practical algorithm for
allocating limited audit resources and a performance guarantee. Simulations
conducted across diverse environments consistently validate the patterns
predicted by our framework, and we release all procedures for full
reproducibility. While our approach operates most strongly under several
assumptions, combining periodic recalibration, randomization, and
connectivity-based alarms enables robust application under the variability of
real-world operations. We present both design principles and operational
guidelines that lower the incentives for metric gaming while sustaining and
expanding stable cooperation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MLP改进的T-MLP架构，通过添加多个输出分支实现多尺度信号表示，在多种信号处理任务中优于现有神经LoD基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多层感知机(MLP)只能在单一尺度上操作，缺乏对层次细节(LoD)表示的原生支持，而LoD表示对于高效建模和传输信号至关重要。

Method: 设计了带尾部的多层感知机(T-MLP)，在隐藏层附加多个输出分支（尾部），通过直接监督多个深度层次来实现多尺度建模。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，T-MLP在各种信号表示任务中都优于其他神经LoD基线方法。

Conclusion: T-MLP架构成功扩展了MLP的能力，使其能够有效支持多尺度信号表示，为层次细节建模提供了有效的神经网络解决方案。

Abstract: Level-of-detail (LoD) representation is critical for efficiently modeling and
transmitting various types of signals, such as images and 3D shapes. In this
work, we present a novel neural architecture that supports LoD signal
representation. Our architecture is based on an elaborate modification of the
widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which inherently operates at a single
scale and therefore lacks native support for LoD. Specifically, we introduce
the Tailed Multi-Layer Perceptron (T-MLP) that extends the MLP by attaching
multiple output branches, also called tails, to its hidden layers, enabling
direct supervision at multiple depths. Our loss formulation and training
strategy allow each hidden layer to effectively learn a target signal at a
specific LoD, thus enabling multi-scale modeling. Extensive experimental
results show that our T-MLP outperforms other neural LoD baselines across a
variety of signal representation tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型部署面临内存管理挑战，特别是基于专家混合架构的模型需要高效管理有限缓存，确保常用专家存储在快速缓存中。

Method: 提出新的专家管理优化分页问题模型，分析确定性/随机算法的竞争比下界，设计针对该问题的分层LRU扩展算法。

Result: 理论分析显示LRU类策略具有良好的竞争性能，实验证明新算法在合成数据集和实际MoE使用轨迹上都优于标准LRU。

Conclusion: 分层LRU扩展算法能有效解决LLM专家缓存管理问题，为实际部署提供了理论保证和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a variety of tasks. One of the main challenges towards the successful
deployment of LLMs is memory management, since they typically involve billions
of parameters. To this end, architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts have been
proposed, which aim to reduce the size of the parameters that are activated
when producing a token. This raises the equally critical issue of efficiently
managing the limited cache of the system, in that frequently used experts
should be stored in the fast cache rather than in the slower secondary memory.
  In this work, we introduce and study a new paging problem that models expert
management optimization. Our formulation captures both the layered architecture
of LLMs and the requirement that experts are cached efficiently. We first
present lower bounds on the competitive ratio of both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, which show that under mild assumptions, LRU-like
policies have good theoretical competitive performance. We then propose a
layer-based extension of LRU that is tailored to the problem at hand.
  Extensive simulations on both synthetic datasets and actual traces of MoE
usage show that our algorithm outperforms policies for the classic paging
problem, such as the standard LRU.

Abstract: Conversational AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful tools
across domains, including cybersecurity, where they help detect threats early
and improve response times. However, challenges such as false positives and
complex model management still limit trust. Although Explainable AI (XAI) aims
to make AI decisions more transparent, many security analysts remain uncertain
about its usefulness. This study presents a framework that detects anomalies
and provides high-quality explanations through visual tools BERTViz and Captum,
combined with natural language reports based on attention outputs. This reduces
manual effort and speeds up remediation. Our comparative analysis showed that
RoBERTa offers high accuracy (99.6 %) and strong anomaly detection,
outperforming Falcon-7B and DeBERTa, as well as exhibiting better flexibility
than large-scale Mistral-7B on the HDFS dataset from LogHub. User feedback
confirms the chatbot's ease of use and improved understanding of anomalies,
demonstrating the ability of the developed framework to strengthen
cybersecurity workflows.

Result: 实验结果表明SynCircuit能够生成更真实的合成电路，并提升下游电路设计任务中机器学习模型的性能。

Conclusion: SynCircuit成功解决了IC设计领域数据稀缺问题，为AI辅助电路设计提供了有效的数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great
potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited,
especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the
primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work,
we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with
valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates
synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a
customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic
Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI
community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit
constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte
Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the
generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit
can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance
in downstream circuit design tasks.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data
landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of
the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical
insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on
the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient
Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The
sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant
challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition,
we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical
efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient
data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language
dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician
workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data
integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability,
maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety,
mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work
represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician
data overload due to combined RPM / EHR data complexities.

Motivation: 核工业对AI/ML应用兴趣增加，但缺乏在运行核反应堆中验证AI/ML工具可行性的研究。需要开发能够区分网络安全事件和操作异常的智能系统。

Method: 采用多层AI/ML架构，整合IT和OT数据流，在普渡大学研究反应堆PUR-1上进行实验，包括14种系统状态和1380多万个多变量数据点，模拟多种网络攻击场景。

Result: AI/ML能够区分正常、异常和网络安全相关事件，即使在拒绝服务攻击等挑战条件下。结合IT和OT数据提高了分类准确性，但在同步和收集方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: AI/ML在核网络安全方面显示出巨大潜力，但需要进一步改进复杂事件区分和多类架构处理能力。

Abstract: There is increased interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning (AI/ML) within the nuclear industry and nuclear engineering community.
Effective implementation of AI/ML could offer benefits to the nuclear domain,
including enhanced identification of anomalies, anticipation of system
failures, and operational schedule optimization. However, limited work has been
done to investigate the feasibility and applicability of AI/ML tools in a
functioning nuclear reactor. Here, we go beyond the development of a single
model and introduce a multi-layered AI/ML architecture that integrates both
information technology and operational technology data streams to identify,
characterize, and differentiate (i) among diverse cybersecurity events and (ii)
between cyber events and other operational anomalies. Leveraging Purdue
Universitys research reactor, PUR-1, we demonstrate this architecture through a
representative use case that includes multiple concurrent false data injections
and denial-of-service attacks of increasing complexity under realistic reactor
conditions. The use case includes 14 system states (1 normal, 13 abnormal) and
over 13.8 million multi-variate operational and information technology data
points. The study demonstrated the capability of AI/ML to distinguish between
normal, abnormal, and cybersecurity-related events, even under challenging
conditions such as denial-of-service attacks. Combining operational and
information technology data improved classification accuracy but posed
challenges related to synchronization and collection during certain cyber
events. While results indicate significant promise for AI/ML in nuclear
cybersecurity, the findings also highlight the need for further refinement in
handling complex event differentiation and multi-class architectures.

TL;DR: GenDataCarto框架通过难度分数和记忆分数对预训练数据进行分类，针对性修剪和权重调整，在仅修剪10%数据的情况下将合成测试样本提取成功率降低40%以上，验证困惑度仅增加0.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生成模型存在过拟合和无意记忆罕见训练样本的风险，这些样本可能被攻击者提取或夸大基准性能，需要数据中心的干预方法来缓解泄露问题。

Method: 提出生成数据制图(GenDataCarto)框架，为每个预训练样本分配难度分数(早期epoch损失)和记忆分数("遗忘事件"频率)，将样本划分为四个象限来指导针对性修剪和上下权重调整。

Result: 经验证明，在仅修剪10%数据的情况下，合成测试样本提取成功率降低40%以上，验证困惑度仅增加不到0.5%。理论证明记忆分数在平滑假设下下界经典影响力，下权重高记忆热点可通过均匀稳定性边界降低泛化差距。

Conclusion: 原则性数据干预可以显著减轻泄露，同时对生成性能影响极小，证明了数据中心方法在生成模型安全中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N和多数投票依赖候选答案质量，当所有候选答案都错误时无法产生正确解，且引入额外模型会增加部署成本。

Method: 提出GSR框架：统一模型并行生成候选答案，然后基于问题和候选答案进行自我精炼合成更优解。设计混合训练管道，联合优化直接解题和精炼候选答案两个互补目标。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中达到最先进性能，学习到的自我精炼技能具有模型无关性，在不同模型规模和分布外推理任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GSR框架有效提升了LLMs解决复杂多步推理问题的能力，通过自我精炼机制实现了无需额外模型的性能提升，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Abstract: In federated learning, communication cost can be significantly reduced by
transmitting the information over the air through physical channels. In this
paper, we propose a new class of adaptive federated stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithms that can be implemented over physical channels, taking into

Conclusion: 联邦学习是一种可行且有效的解决方案，能够在符合巴西数据保护法要求的前提下，构建协作性预测模型。

Abstract: The application of data mining and artificial intelligence in education
offers unprecedented potential for personalizing learning and early
identification of at-risk students. However, the practical use of these
techniques faces a significant barrier in privacy legislation, such as Brazil's
General Data Protection Law (LGPD), which restricts the centralization of
sensitive student data. To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving
computational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the
feasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx
algorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian
Basic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was
trained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its
performance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two
million student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an
accuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of
61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust
privacy guarantee. The results indicate that Federated Learning is a viable and
effective solution for building collaborative predictive models in the
Brazilian educational context, in alignment with the requirements of the LGPD.

Motivation: 现有LSTM模型虽然通过门控机制处理长期信息，但未能最优地关注特定旧索引信息，缺乏权重归一化研究，且门控单元的非线性化程度不足。

Method: 1) 输入重排序方法优先处理特定输入索引；2) 通过监督损失函数选择最佳Lp范数进行权重归一化；3) 使用小型前馈神经网络对门控进行非线性化增强。

Result: 在文本分类任务中，所提出的方法相比简单LSTM模型提高了准确率。

Conclusion: 输入重排序、权重归一化和门非线性化三种方法能有效提升LSTM性能，特别是在处理长期依赖和特定历史信息方面表现更优。

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has
a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating
mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However,
even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or
long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches
to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found
in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right
weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this
paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either
smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs
and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous
inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As
analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to
bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to
peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of
nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's
knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple
LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results
show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Method: CEAT利用子模型间的概率差异自适应分配样本权重，加入校准距离正则化，使预测差异大的样本在其他子模型训练中获得更多关注

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CEAT达到了最先进的性能，优于现有集成对抗训练方法

Conclusion: CEAT是一种模型无关的高效方法，可无缝适配各种集成方法，具有灵活的适用性

Abstract: Ensemble Adversarial Training (EAT) attempts to enhance the robustness of
models against adversarial attacks by leveraging multiple models. However,
current EAT strategies tend to train the sub-models independently, ignoring the
cooperative benefits between sub-models. Through detailed inspections of the
process of EAT, we find that that samples with classification disparities
between sub-models are close to the decision boundary of ensemble, exerting
greater influence on the robustness of ensemble. To this end, we propose a
novel yet efficient Collaborative Ensemble Adversarial Training (CEAT), to
highlight the cooperative learning among sub-models in the ensemble. To be
specific, samples with larger predictive disparities between the sub-models
will receive greater attention during the adversarial training of the other
sub-models. CEAT leverages the probability disparities to adaptively assign
weights to different samples, by incorporating a calibrating distance
regularization. Extensive experiments on widely-adopted datasets show that our
proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance over competitive EAT
methods. It is noteworthy that CEAT is model-agnostic, which can be seamlessly
adapted into various ensemble methods with flexible applicability.

Abstract: Traditional budget allocation models struggle with the stochastic and
nonlinear nature of real-world financial data. This study proposes a hybrid
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for dynamic budget allocation, enhanced
with Dirichlet-inspired stochasticity and quantum mutation-based genetic
optimization. Using Apple Inc. quarterly financial data (2009 to 2025), the RL
agent learns to allocate budgets between Research and Development and Selling,
General and Administrative to maximize profitability while adhering to
historical spending patterns, with L2 penalties discouraging unrealistic
deviations. A Dirichlet distribution governs state evolution to simulate
shifting financial contexts. To escape local minima and improve generalization,
the trained policy is refined using genetic algorithms with quantum mutation
via parameterized qubit rotation circuits. Generation-wise rewards and
penalties are logged to visualize convergence and policy behavior. On unseen
fiscal data, the model achieves high alignment with actual allocations (cosine
similarity 0.9990, KL divergence 0.0023), demonstrating the promise of
combining deep RL, stochastic modeling, and quantum-inspired heuristics for
adaptive enterprise budgeting.

Motivation: 现有LLM剪枝方法虽然能保持下游任务性能，但会破坏模型内部用于谎言检测的关键激活特征，这在实际部署中可能带来安全隐患。

Method: 提出TPLO方法，通过同时关注具有更多激活异常值和更强判别性特征的层来进行剪枝，并引入提示规则来丰富TruthfulQA基准。

Result: 在50%稀疏度下达到88%的幻觉检测准确率，同时提升了在TruthfulQA基准上的性能。

Conclusion: TPLO方法成功解决了剪枝与谎言检测能力之间的权衡问题，为安全部署剪枝后的LLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Abstract: Synthesis procedures play a critical role in materials research, as they
directly affect material properties. With data-driven approaches increasingly
accelerating materials discovery, there is growing interest in extracting
synthesis procedures from scientific literature as structured data. However,
existing studies often rely on rigid, domain-specific schemas with predefined
fields for structuring synthesis procedures or assume that synthesis procedures
are linear sequences of operations, which limits their ability to capture the
structural complexity of real-world procedures. To address these limitations,
we adopt PROV-DM, an international standard for provenance information, which
supports flexible, graph-based modeling of procedures. We present MatPROV, a
dataset of PROV-DM-compliant synthesis procedures extracted from scientific
literature using large language models. MatPROV captures structural
complexities and causal relationships among materials, operations, and
conditions through visually intuitive directed graphs. This representation
enables machine-interpretable synthesis knowledge, opening opportunities for
future research such as automated synthesis planning and optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了PEGE方法替代STE，通过渐进式元素级梯度估计和混合精度替换策略，在量化感知训练中同时最小化任务损失和量化误差，显著提升低比特量化模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的STE方法忽视了连续值与量化值之间的离散化误差，特别是在极低比特宽度下会导致精度下降，需要更好的梯度估计方法来改善量化训练效果。

Method: 提出渐进式元素级梯度估计(PEGE)，采用对数课程驱动的混合精度替换策略，逐步用量化值替代全精度权重和激活值，将QAT建模为同时最小化预测任务损失和量化离散误差的协同优化问题。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上对各种架构(如ResNet、VGG)的广泛实验表明，PEGE始终优于现有的反向传播方法，使低精度模型能够匹配甚至超越全精度对应模型的准确性。

Conclusion: PEGE提供了一个统一且可推广的框架，能够无缝集成到任何前向传播方法中，有效解决了STE忽略离散化误差的问题，显著提升了量化模型的准确性。

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Motivation: 解决量子退火在组合优化问题应用中的两大挑战：人工将问题描述转换为QUBO格式的复杂性，以及当前量子硬件的可扩展性限制

Method: 使用大语言模型解析自然语言生成数学表示，采用混合量子经典Benders分解方法，将组合复杂的主问题编译为紧凑QUBO格式，线性结构子问题委托给经典求解器

Conclusion: 提出了一个连接经典AI和量子计算的协同计算范式，显著降低了使用门槛，为大规模实际优化挑战提供了可行的量子加速器路径

Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely
hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem
descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To
address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,
that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system
leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically
generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware
limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition
method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial
complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly
structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated
QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical
solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the
framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a
synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,
addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.
This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a
viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for
large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.

Motivation: 职业事故报告自动分类对提升工作场所安全和大规模风险分析至关重要，但现实数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题会损害分析模型性能，特别是对于罕见但严重的事故类型。

Method: 提出ABEX-RAT框架：1）ABEX两步流程：使用大语言模型提取核心事故语义，然后用生成模型为少数类创建高质量合成样本；2）RAT对抗训练：在增强数据上训练轻量级分类器，通过随机扰动提升模型泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种协同策略是专门化、不平衡分类任务中强力微调的高效替代方案，验证了该方法的有效性和效率。

Abstract: The automatic classification of occupational accident reports is a critical
research area for enhancing workplace safety and enabling large-scale risk
analysis. However, the severe class imbalance inherent in these real-world
datasets often compromises the performance of analytical models, particularly
for rare but severe incident types, hindering the development of reliable
automated systems. To address this challenge, we propose ABEX-RAT, a novel and
efficient framework that synergizes generative data augmentation with robust
adversarial training. Our approach first employs a twostep
abstractive-expansive (ABEX) pipeline, which leverages a large language model
to distill core incident semantics and then uses a generative model to create
diverse, highquality synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
Subsequently, a lightweight classifier is trained on the augmented data using a
computationally efficient random adversarial training (RAT) protocol, which
stochastically applies perturbations to enhance model generalization and
robustness without significant overhead. Experimental results on the public
OSHA dataset demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, reaching a macro-F1 score of 90.32% and significantly
outperforming previous SOTA and fine-tuned large model baselines. Our work
validates that this synergistic strategy is a highly effective and efficient
alternative to brute-force fine-tuning for specialized, imbalanced
classification tasks. The code is publicly available

Motivation: 当前ECG Transformer模型仅使用最后一层表示，但理论和实证分析表明这不是最优选择，需要充分利用各层表示的多样性

Method: 1D ViT掩码预训练后，在下游任务中使用门控网络选择性融合各层表示；同时扩展至预训练阶段，通过分组平均聚合表示

Result: PMA方法能够有效提升ECG基础模型在下游应用中的性能表现

Conclusion: 充分利用Transformer各层表示的多样性比仅使用最后一层表示能获得更好的下游任务性能

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have
recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications.
However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not
been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the
final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto}
representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks?
Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this
question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the
representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we
introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers
Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise
representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model.
We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision
Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of
relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to
selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers,
thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the
downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the
pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise
averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Method: 使用6个完全枚举的分类反应数据集（768-5684个实验），比较LLM引导优化与贝叶斯优化和随机采样的性能，引入拓扑无关的信息理论框架量化采样多样性

Result: 前沿LLM在5个单目标数据集上持续匹配或超越贝叶斯优化性能，优势随参数复杂性增加和高性能条件稀缺而增强；LLM在所有数据集中保持更高的探索熵

Conclusion: LLM-GO在传统方法困难的复杂分类空间中表现出色，预训练领域知识实现了更有效的化学参数空间导航而非替代结构化探索策略

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search
through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm.
Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684
experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian
optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or
exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages
growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become
scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective
trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a
topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity
throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain
systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while
achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in
solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails
- suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective
navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured
exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community
validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a
no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM
optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our
findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods
struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than
mathematical optimization.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger
models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown
proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a
wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates
principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning
systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints
and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture
design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose
novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying
discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based
training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These
approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,
leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the
context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture
search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore
implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,
revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an
adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via
scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image
classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the
proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and
inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's
performance.

Motivation: 解决多体系统数据驱动建模中的两个主要挑战：高计算成本和有限的长期预测精度。传统神经ODE需要通过ODE求解器进行反向传播，这成为计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出Flow-Matching神经ODE（FNODE）框架，直接从轨迹数据学习加速度向量场。通过监督加速度而非积分状态来重新制定训练目标，使用混合FFT和有限差分方案高效计算加速度目标。

Result: 在单/三质量-弹簧-阻尼系统、双摆、滑块曲柄和车杆等多个基准测试中，FNODE始终优于MBD-NODE、LSTM和FCNN等现有方法，展现出良好的准确性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: FNODE通过直接学习加速度场的方法有效解决了多体系统建模的计算瓶颈问题，为约束多体系统的数据驱动建模提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven modeling of constrained multibody systems faces two persistent
challenges: high computational cost and limited long-term prediction accuracy.
To address these issues, we introduce the Flow-Matching Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (FNODE), a framework that learns acceleration vector
fields directly from trajectory data. By reformulating the training objective
to supervise accelerations rather than integrated states, FNODE eliminates the
need for backpropagation through an ODE solver, which represents a bottleneck
in traditional Neural ODEs. Acceleration targets are computed efficiently using
numerical differentiation techniques, including a hybrid Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and Finite Difference (FD) scheme. We evaluate FNODE on a diverse set of
benchmarks, including the single and triple mass-spring-damper systems, double
pendulum, slider-crank, and cart-pole. Across all cases, FNODE consistently
outperforms existing approaches such as Multi-Body Dynamic Neural ODE
(MBD-NODE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Fully Connected Neural

Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署智能AI代理对隐私和响应性至关重要，但内存限制通常迫使使用推理能力较差的小型LLM。现有的测试时扩展方法在边缘硬件上会产生过高开销。

Method: FlashTTS引入三项优化技术：1)推测性波束扩展以减少不规则推理路径导致的系统延迟；2)非对称多模型内存分配来动态平衡生成和验证的内存使用；3)动态前缀感知调度以最大化KV缓存重用。

Abstract: Deploying agentic AI on edge devices is crucial for privacy and
responsiveness, but memory constraints typically relegate these systems to
smaller Large Language Models (LLMs) with inferior reasoning capabilities.
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) can bridge this reasoning gap by dedicating more
compute during inference, but existing methods incur prohibitive overhead on
edge hardware. To overcome this, we introduce FlashTTS, a serving system that
makes TTS practical for memory-constrained LLM reasoning. FlashTTS introduces
three synergistic optimizations: (i) Speculative Beam Extension to mitigate
system stragglers from irregular reasoning paths; (ii) Asymmetric Multi-Model
Memory Allocation to dynamically balance memory between generation and

higher goodput and reduces latency by 38%-68% compared to a vLLM baseline,
paving the way for democratized, high-performance agentic AI on edge devices.

Method: 基于TLinFormer，采用周期性状态更新机制：k-1步进行恒定时间计算，第k步执行线性时间全局信息同步

Result: 在长文本推理任务中，TConstFormer在速度、内存效率和整体性能方面展现出压倒性优势

Conclusion: 这一突破为高效和鲁棒的流式语言模型应用铺平了道路

Abstract: Although the Transformer has become the cornerstone of modern AI, its
autoregressive inference suffers from a linearly growing KV Cache and a
computational complexity of O(N^2 d), severely hindering its ability to process
ultra-long sequences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces the
TConstFormer architecture, building upon our previous work, TLinFormer.
TConstFormer employs an innovative periodic state update mechanism to achieve a
truly constant-size O(1) KV Cache. The computational complexity of this
mechanism is also O(1) in an amortized sense: it performs purely constant-time
computations for $k-1$ consecutive steps (e.g., $k=256$) and executes a single
linear-time global information synchronization only on the $k$-th step.
Theoretical calculations and experimental results demonstrate that TConstFormer
exhibits an overwhelming advantage over baseline models in terms of speed,
memory efficiency, and overall performance on long-text inference tasks. This
breakthrough paves the way for efficient and robust streaming language model
applications.

Motivation: 现有参数估计方法（如稀疏识别和PINNs）在处理非线性动力学、多物理场相互作用或有限观测时表现不佳，需要一种能够从稀疏测量中准确推断参数场的通用方法。

Method: 采用独立坐标神经网络在物理空间或状态变量中连续表示每个参数场，能够从稀疏系统响应测量中推断参数场。

Conclusion: Neptune通过实现可靠且数据高效的参数推断，在工程、医疗等领域具有广泛的变革性影响，并展现出优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the mathematical
modeling of complex systems in diverse domains, including engineering,
healthcare, and physics. A central challenge in using PDEs for real-world
applications is to accurately infer the parameters, particularly when the
parameters exhibit non-linear and spatiotemporal variations. Existing parameter
estimation methods, such as sparse identification and physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), struggle in such cases, especially with nonlinear dynamics,
multiphysics interactions, or limited observations of the system response. To
address these challenges, we introduce Neptune, a general-purpose method
capable of inferring parameter fields from sparse measurements of system
responses. Neptune employs independent coordinate neural networks to
continuously represent each parameter field in physical space or in state
variables. Across various physical and biomedical problems, where direct
parameter measurements are prohibitively expensive or unattainable, Neptune
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving robust parameter
estimation from as few as 50 observations, reducing parameter estimation errors
by two orders of magnitude and dynamic response prediction errors by a factor
of ten compared to PINNs. Furthermore, Neptune exhibits superior extrapolation
capabilities, enabling accurate predictions in regimes beyond training data
where PINN fail. By facilitating reliable and data-efficient parameter
inference, Neptune promises broad transformative impacts in engineering,
healthcare, and beyond.

fine-grained per-operator sharding dimensions for distributed LLM inference.
Our method employs an attention-based policy over an elite history that learns
from high-performing strategies to efficiently navigate the vast combinatorial
search space. Evaluated on H100 clusters with MoE models up to 1.6T parameters,
Learn to Shard achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over metaheuristic
baselines and 1.06x over Megatron heuristics.

TL;DR: 语音基础模型（HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0）学习到的表征具有领域无关性，在可穿戴传感器时间序列任务中达到最先进性能，特别是在情绪分类、心律失常检测和活动分类任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音和传感器时间序列数据在时域和频域的共性，研究语音基础模型是否能够学习到跨领域的通用表征，以解决数据稀缺的时间序列任务。

Method: 使用HuBERT和wav2vec 2.0语音基础模型提取特征，然后训练简单的探针分类器，应用于可穿戴传感器的时间序列分类任务。

Result: 语音模型提取的特征在多个传感器任务上超越了直接在特定模态数据集上训练的自监督模型，特别是卷积特征编码器在可穿戴传感器任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 语音基础模型学习到的表征具有领域通用性，能够显著提升数据稀缺时间序列任务的性能和鲁棒性，为构建通用的语音和传感器时间序列模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time-
and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show
that speech foundation models learn representations that are domain-independent
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on time series tasks from wearable
sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0
outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on
modality specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and
activity classification tasks. We find a particularly strong relevance of the
convolutional feature encoders from speech models for wearable sensor tasks.
The methods proposed here improve performance and robustness for data-scarce
time series tasks, using simple probing methods. This work is a step towards
generalized time series models for speech and sensor data, a topic for further
exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时序预测中Transformer模型的二次复杂度问题和状态空间模型的不稳定训练动态、初始化敏感性以及多变量预测鲁棒性有限的问题

Method: 结合状态空间动力学和变分量子门，使用参数化量子电路(RY-RX ansatz)的期望值自适应调节记忆更新，替代昂贵的注意力机制

Result: 在ETT、Traffic和Exchange Rate三个基准测试中一致优于LSTM、TCN、Reformer、Transformer-based模型和S-Mamba等强基线方法

Conclusion: 变分量子门机制能够有效解决长程预测中的当前限制，实现准确且鲁棒的多变量预测

Abstract: Long-range time series forecasting remains challenging, as it requires
capturing non-stationary and multi-scale temporal dependencies while
maintaining noise robustness, efficiency, and stability. Transformer-based
architectures such as Autoformer and Informer improve generalization but suffer
from quadratic complexity and degraded performance on very long time horizons.
State space models, notably S-Mamba, provide linear-time updates but often face
unstable training dynamics, sensitivity to initialization, and limited
robustness for multivariate forecasting. To address such challenges, we propose
the Quantum-Optimized Selective State Space Model (Q-SSM), a hybrid
quantum-optimized approach that integrates state space dynamics with a
variational quantum gate. Instead of relying on expensive attention mechanisms,
Q-SSM employs a simple parametrized quantum circuit (RY-RX ansatz) whose
expectation values regulate memory updates adaptively. This quantum gating
mechanism improves convergence stability, enhances the modeling of long-term
dependencies, and provides a lightweight alternative to attention. We
empirically validate Q-SSM on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., ETT, Traffic,
and Exchange Rate. Results show that Q-SSM consistently improves over strong
baselines (LSTM, TCN, Reformer), Transformer-based models, and S-Mamba. These
findings demonstrate that variational quantum gating can address current
limitations in long-range forecasting, leading to accurate and robust
multivariate predictions.

Conclusion: ReLATE框架能够自动适应不规则张量形状和数据分布，生成高效的稀疏张量表示，显著提升张量分解性能。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition (TD) is essential for analyzing high-dimensional sparse
data, yet its irregular computations and memory-access patterns pose major
performance challenges on modern parallel processors. Prior works rely on
expert-designed sparse tensor formats that fail to adapt to irregular tensor
shapes and/or highly variable data distributions. We present the
reinforcement-learned adaptive tensor encoding (ReLATE) framework, a novel
learning-augmented method that automatically constructs efficient sparse tensor
representations without labeled training samples. ReLATE employs an autonomous
agent that discovers optimized tensor encodings through direct interaction with
the TD environment, leveraging a hybrid model-free and model-based algorithm to
learn from both real and imagined actions. Moreover, ReLATE introduces
rule-driven action masking and dynamics-informed action filtering mechanisms
that ensure functionally correct tensor encoding with bounded execution time,
even during early learning stages. By automatically adapting to both irregular
tensor shapes and data distributions, ReLATE generates sparse tensor
representations that consistently outperform expert-designed formats across
diverse sparse tensor data sets, achieving up to 2X speedup compared to the
best sparse format, with a geometric-mean speedup of 1.4-1.46X.

Conclusion: 连续温度滴果样本器通过改善提案分布的探索能力，有效解决了传统方法在疾病性逆变路径上的问题，实现了更好的样本生成性能。

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized
distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities
interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training
phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are
generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a
proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed
Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of
the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration
and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose
continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques
developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal
distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different
temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and
drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate
improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available

Motivation: TabPFN v2在多个表格基准测试中优于基于树的模型，但由于Transformer的二次计算和内存成本，无法处理超过10K上下文tokens。现有方法依赖上下文压缩（如KNN选择代表性样本），需要探索更好的解决方案

Method: 引入tiled-block策略在TabPFN框架内计算注意力，该设计与标准GPU设置兼容，是首个无需预处理即可让TabPFN处理长上下文的方法

Result: 在标准TabArena基准测试中证明了该方法的有效性，能够处理超过10K tokens的长上下文

Conclusion: 提出的tiled-block策略成功解决了TabPFN处理长上下文的限制，为表格数据上的Transformer应用提供了新的可能性

Abstract: TabPFN v2 achieves better results than tree-based models on several tabular
benchmarks, which is notable since tree-based models are usually the strongest
choice for tabular data. However, it cannot handle more than 10K context tokens
because transformers have quadratic computation and memory costs.
  Unlike existing approaches that rely on context compression, such as
selecting representative samples via K-nearest neighbors (KNN), we introduce a
\textbf{tiled-block} strategy to compute attention within the TabPFN framework.
This design is compatible with standard GPU setups and, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first to enable TabPFN to \textbf{process long contexts
without any pre-processing}. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
on the standard TabArena benchmark.

Motivation: 基于隐式反馈的推荐系统存在曝光偏差问题，虽然逆倾向评分(IPS)可以纠正这种偏差，但通常存在高方差和不稳定性。

Method: 整合IPS加权训练与IPS加权的贝叶斯个性化排序(BPR)目标，并加入倾向性正则化(PR)来缓解极端倾向权重带来的方差放大问题。

Result: 在合成数据和MovieLens 100K数据上的实验表明，该方法在无偏曝光下泛化能力更好，相比朴素和标准IPS方法降低了评估方差。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实推荐场景中的反事实学习和评估提供了实用指导，能够有效处理曝光偏差问题并提高模型稳定性。

Abstract: Learning and evaluating recommender systems from logged implicit feedback is
challenging due to exposure bias. While inverse propensity scoring (IPS)
corrects this bias, it often suffers from high variance and instability. In
this paper, we present a simple and effective pipeline that integrates
IPS-weighted training with an IPS-weighted Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)
objective augmented by a Propensity Regularizer (PR). We compare Direct Method
(DM), IPS, and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS) for offline policy evaluation, and
demonstrate how IPS-weighted training improves model robustness under biased
exposure. The proposed PR further mitigates variance amplification from extreme
propensity weights, leading to more stable estimates. Experiments on synthetic
and MovieLens 100K data show that our approach generalizes better under
unbiased exposure while reducing evaluation variance compared to naive and
standard IPS methods, offering practical guidance for counterfactual learning
and evaluation in real-world recommendation settings.

*An B. Vuong,Michael T. McCann,Javier E. Santos,Yen Ting Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩散模型通常被解释为学习噪声数据的对数密度梯度（得分函数），但实际训练的网络违反了保守向量场的约束条件。研究表明扩散训练更适合理解为Wasserstein梯度流的速度场匹配，而非得分学习，这解释了即使神经网络向量场不是真实得分函数时生成采样仍能成功的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上认为扩散模型学习的是得分函数（保守向量场），但实际神经网络架构并不强制这一约束。研究发现训练后的扩散网络违反了真实得分函数的积分和微分约束，这与模型优秀的生成性能形成矛盾，需要新的理论解释。

Method: 通过数值实验证明训练后的扩散网络违反保守向量场约束，提出从Wasserstein梯度流（WGF）视角理解扩散训练，将其视为速度场匹配而非得分学习，分析神经网络近似误差对密度传输的影响。

Result: 实验显示扩散网络学习的向量场不是保守的，但模型仍能成功生成样本。从WGF框架解释，概率流自然产生，无需反向时间SDE理论，非保守误差不一定损害密度传输性能。

Conclusion: WGF视角为理解扩散生成模型提供了更原则性、优雅且理论基础坚实的框架，建议采用这一视角替代传统的得分学习解释，能更好地解释实际观察到的现象。

Abstract: Diffusion models are commonly interpreted as learning the score function,
i.e., the gradient of the log-density of noisy data. However, this assumption
implies that the target of learning is a conservative vector field, which is
not enforced by the neural network architectures used in practice. We present
numerical evidence that trained diffusion networks violate both integral and
differential constraints required of true score functions, demonstrating that
the learned vector fields are not conservative. Despite this, the models
perform remarkably well as generative mechanisms. To explain this apparent
paradox, we advocate a new theoretical perspective: diffusion training is
better understood as flow matching to the velocity field of a Wasserstein
Gradient Flow (WGF), rather than as score learning for a reverse-time
stochastic differential equation. Under this view, the "probability flow"
arises naturally from the WGF framework, eliminating the need to invoke
reverse-time SDE theory and clarifying why generative sampling remains
successful even when the neural vector field is not a true score. We further
show that non-conservative errors from neural approximation do not necessarily
harm density transport. Our results advocate for adopting the WGF perspective
as a principled, elegant, and theoretically grounded framework for
understanding diffusion generative models.

Conclusion: LLMDPD成功解决了离线RL的泛化问题，通过结合文本和轨迹提示，利用LLM的知识和扩散模型的生成能力，为智能体提供了强大的跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making
capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios.
However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of
well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of
generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations
of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often
struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge,
we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances
generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method
incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide
policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based
prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge
base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode
trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral
patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as
conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling
the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental
results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods
on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and
adaptability in diverse settings.

Motivation: 虽然PERL方法在数值实验中被证明具有参数少、收敛快、样本需求低等优势，但这些结果缺乏理论解释，需要从理论层面阐明其优势机理。

Method: 研究具有Lipschitz连续性的问题类别，通过分析损失函数边界与残差学习结构的关系，严格证明了一系列解释PERL优势的定理。

Conclusion: PERL在提高预测性能的同时减少了数据需求，在真实世界自动驾驶应用中具有重要价值，特别是在难以获取极端案例数据的情况下。

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural
networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability.
One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning
(PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model
prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating
such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction
in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence
rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational
precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and
cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical
perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz
continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the
loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a
set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory
prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results
confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently
achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate
the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where
corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves
predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的权重初始化方法（如He、Xavier、正交初始化）在深度ReLU网络中无法有效调节预激活均值和控制激活稀疏性，导致神经元永久失活（dying ReLU）和梯度不稳定问题。

Method: 通过在Stiefel流形上求解优化问题，开发了一种专门针对ReLU优化的正交初始化方法，推导出了闭式解和高效采样方案，从初始化阶段就保持尺度并校准预激活统计量。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法能防止dying ReLU问题、减缓激活方差衰减、缓解梯度消失，在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、表格数据集、少样本设置和ReLU族激活函数上均优于现有初始化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度ReLU网络的训练稳定性和性能，为深度架构中的信号和梯度流提供了有效保障。

Abstract: Stable and efficient training of ReLU networks with large depth is highly
sensitive to weight initialization. Improper initialization can cause permanent
neuron inactivation dying ReLU and exacerbate gradient instability as network
depth increases. Methods such as He, Xavier, and orthogonal initialization
preserve variance or promote approximate isometry. However, they do not
necessarily regulate the pre-activation mean or control activation sparsity,
and their effectiveness often diminishes in very deep architectures. This work
introduces an orthogonal initialization specifically optimized for ReLU by
solving an optimization problem on the Stiefel manifold, thereby preserving
scale and calibrating the pre-activation statistics from the outset. A family
of closed-form solutions and an efficient sampling scheme are derived.
Theoretical analysis at initialization shows that prevention of the dying ReLU
problem, slower decay of activation variance, and mitigation of gradient
vanishing, which together stabilize signal and gradient flow in deep
architectures. Empirically, across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, multiple tabular
datasets, few-shot settings, and ReLU-family activations, our method
outperforms previous initializations and enables stable training in deep
networks.

Conclusion: PerturbEmbedding提供了一个有效的统一对抗训练框架，能够显著增强GNN模型的安全性和泛化性能，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to
adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have
implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the
robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying
perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently
minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the
adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in
enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has
been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we
propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial
perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and
improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation
operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified
framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a
unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and
adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using
different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly
improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs,
outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and
adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's
performance.

Conclusion: CUFL通过课程学习调节个性化过程，有效防止早期过拟合，并通过改进的相似性估计方法提升了联邦学习在子图数据上的聚合效果。

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data
heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation
personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from
clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model
states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid
overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even
collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce
their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available.
To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called
Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the
client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges
for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first
to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder,
client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased
patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization,
the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic
knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves
weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained
structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior
performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at

Motivation: 各向异性参数分布是低比特量化训练的主要障碍，少数主导奇异值导致宽数值范围与块量化偏置冲突，造成训练不稳定和性能下降。

Conclusion: Metis为先进低比特量化下的鲁棒和可扩展LLM训练铺平了道路。

Abstract: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental
barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a
few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with
the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately
preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training
instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training
framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to
efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad
distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning
rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better
capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range
regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range
distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8
training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy
comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under
advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available

Conclusion: 多动作部分可观测躁动老虎机是一个具有挑战性的问题，需要新的算法和方法来处理多动作选择和部分可观测性。拉格朗日边界方法和近似计算策略为解决这类问题提供了有效途径，但Whittle指数策略在多动作情况下存在局限性，需要进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Partially observable restless multi-armed bandits have found numerous
applications including in recommendation systems, communication systems, public
healthcare outreach systems, and in operations research. We study multi-action
partially observable restless multi-armed bandits, it is a generalization of
the classical restless multi-armed bandit problem -- 1) each bandit has finite
states, and the current state is not observable, 2) each bandit has finite
actions. In particular, we assume that more than two actions are available for
each bandit. We motivate our problem with the application of public-health
intervention planning. We describe the model and formulate a long term
discounted optimization problem, where the state of each bandit evolves
according to a Markov process, and this evolution is action dependent. The
state of a bandit is not observable but one of finitely many feedback signals
are observable. Each bandit yields a reward, based on the action taken on that
bandit. The agent is assumed to have a budget constraint. The bandits are
assumed to be independent. However, they are weakly coupled at the agent
through the budget constraint.
  We first analyze the Lagrangian bound method for our partially observable
restless bandits. The computation of optimal value functions for finite-state,
finite-action POMDPs is non-trivial. Hence, the computation of Lagrangian
bounds is also challenging. We describe approximations for the computation of
Lagrangian bounds using point based value iteration (PBVI) and online rollout
policy. We further present various properties of the value functions and
provide theoretical insights on PBVI and online rollout policy. We study
heuristic policies for multi-actions PORMAB. Finally, we discuss present
Whittle index policies and their limitations in our model.

### [71] [Memory Limitations of Prompt Tuning in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00421)
*Maxime Meyer,Mario Michelessa,Caroline Chaux,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过理论分析证明了变换器模型的记忆能力有内在限制，调试提示的记忆信息量不能超过线性增长，并且较长上下文会导致性能氛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然调试提示在实践中表现出良好的适配能力，但其理论分析还很有限。现有理论工作主要关注通用近似性质，而本文要探索变换器的记忆能力这一不同方面。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，提供了两个主要理论贡献：1）证明调试提示的记忆信息量不能超过线性增长；2）形式化证明大语言模型中观察到的较长上下文导致性能氛化的现象。

Result: 理论证明了变换器具有有限的内在记忆能力，无论上下文长度如何，其能够保留的信息量都有限制。这解释了为什么较长的序列会导致性能氛化。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对变换器架构内在限制的基本理解，特别是在处理长序列方面的能力。这为调试提示的理论基础做出了重要贡献，并为理解大语言模型的行为提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of prompt tuning in adapting pretrained
language models to new tasks, theoretical analyses of its capabilities remain
limited. Existing theoretical work primarily addresses universal approximation
properties, demonstrating results comparable to standard weight tuning. In this
paper, we explore a different aspect of the theory of transformers: the
memorization capability of prompt tuning. We provide two principal theoretical
contributions. First, we prove that the amount of information memorized by a
transformer cannot scale faster than linearly with the prompt length. Second,
and more importantly, we present the first formal proof of a phenomenon
empirically observed in large language models: performance degradation in
transformers with extended contexts. We rigorously demonstrate that
transformers inherently have limited memory, constraining the amount of
information they can retain, regardless of the context size. This finding
offers a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic limitations of transformer
architectures, particularly their ability to handle long sequences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用框架来评估稀疏性鲁棒性，并系统研究了现代大语言模型（包括扩散LLM）中FFN层的激活稀疏性现象，揭示了普遍模式并提供了实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 输入相关的激活稀疏性是深度学习模型的重要特性，但在ReLU激活函数的研究方法无法直接迁移到现代大语言模型，当前LLM激活稀疏性研究缺乏统一框架和共识。

Method: 提出了一个评估稀疏性鲁棒性的通用框架，系统研究了现代LLM（含扩散LLM）前馈网络层的激活稀疏性现象。

Result: 发现了LLM中激活稀疏性的普遍模式，为理解这一现象提供了深刻见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为模型设计和加速中利用激活稀疏性提供了实用指南，建立了LLM激活稀疏性研究的统一框架。

Abstract: Input-dependent activation sparsity is a notable property of deep learning
models, which has been extensively studied in networks with ReLU activations
and is associated with efficiency, robustness, and interpretability. However,
the approaches developed for ReLU-based models depend on exact zero activations
and do not transfer directly to modern large language models~(LLMs), which have
abandoned ReLU in favor of other activation functions. As a result, current
work on activation sparsity in LLMs is fragmented, model-specific, and lacks
consensus on which components to target. We propose a general framework to
assess sparsity robustness and present a systematic study of the phenomenon in
the FFN layers of modern LLMs, including diffusion LLMs. Our findings reveal
universal patterns of activation sparsity in LLMs, provide insights into this
phenomenon, and offer practical guidelines for exploiting it in model design
and acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究分析了不同图像自回归模型中的记忆化模式，发现层次化架构早期出现记忆化而标准架构后期集中，通过干预最记忆化组件可显著减少数据泄露风险且不影响生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像自回归模型在生成速度和质量方面达到最先进水平，但也引发了对其训练数据记忆化及其隐私影响的担忧，需要探索记忆化发生的位置和方式

Method: 通过细粒度记忆化测量分析不同图像自回归架构，比较层次化每分辨率架构和标准每token预测架构的记忆化模式差异

Result: 层次化架构的记忆化早期出现并随分辨率加深，标准架构的记忆化集中在后期处理阶段，干预最记忆化组件可显著降低数据提取能力

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图像生成模型的内部行为，为减轻隐私风险提供了实用策略，通过针对性干预可在保持生成质量的同时有效缓解数据泄露问题

Abstract: Image AutoRegressive (IAR) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance
in speed and quality of generated images. However, they also raise concerns
about memorization of their training data and its implications for privacy.
This work explores where and how such memorization occurs within different
image autoregressive architectures by measuring a fine-grained memorization.
The analysis reveals that memorization patterns differ across various
architectures of IARs. In hierarchical per-resolution architectures, it tends
to emerge early and deepen with resolutions, while in IARs with standard
autoregressive per token prediction, it concentrates in later processing
stages. These localization of memorization patterns are further connected to
IARs' ability to memorize and leak training data. By intervening on their most
memorizing components, we significantly reduce the capacity for data extraction
from IARs with minimal impact on the quality of generated images. These
findings offer new insights into the internal behavior of image generative
models and point toward practical strategies for mitigating privacy risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测研究在建模多视角时空相关性方面存在不足，忽视了交通模式与空间相关性的交互融合，且受限于空间异质性，未能充分考虑消息传递过程中的区域异质性。

Method: 提出模式-空间交互融合框架（包含模式和空间模块），采用从全局到局部的感知视角捕获模式与空间相关性；设计基于消息传递的图卷积网络，利用区域特征库重构具有区域感知能力的数据驱动消息传递。

Conclusion: PSIRAGCN通过有效的模式-空间交互融合和区域感知机制，显著提升了交通预测性能，为解决时空相关性建模和区域异质性处理提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is significant for urban traffic management, intelligent
route planning, and real-time flow monitoring. Recent advances in
spatial-temporal models have markedly improved the modeling of intricate
spatial-temporal correlations for traffic forecasting. Unfortunately, most
previous studies have encountered challenges in effectively modeling
spatial-temporal correlations across various perceptual perspectives, which
have neglected the interactive fusion between traffic patterns and spatial
correlations. Additionally, constrained by spatial heterogeneity, most studies
fail to consider distinct regional heterogeneity during message-passing. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a Pattern-Spatial Interactive and
Regional Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (PSIRAGCN) for traffic
forecasting. Specifically, we propose a pattern-spatial interactive fusion
framework composed of pattern and spatial modules. This framework aims to
capture patterns and spatial correlations by adopting a perception perspective
from the global to the local level and facilitating mutual utilization with
positive feedback. In the spatial module, we designed a graph convolutional
network based on message-passing. The network is designed to leverage a
regional characteristics bank to reconstruct data-driven message-passing with
regional awareness. Reconstructed message passing can reveal the regional
heterogeneity between nodes in the traffic network. Extensive experiments on
three real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that PSIRAGCN outperforms the
State-of-the-art baseline while balancing computational costs.

TL;DR: 提出基于图注意力网络（GAT）的基因通路建模框架，相比传统MLP方法在预测通路动态方面MSE降低81%，并能正确发现基因相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型将基因视为无结构标记或忽略通路内部拓扑结构，无法有效利用已知的生物通路信息。

Method: 使用图注意力网络在基因级别建模生物通路，通过边干预编码药物机制，提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在未见治疗条件下预测通路动态时，GAT比MLP的MSE降低81%；成功从原始时间序列mRNA数据中重新发现TP53-MDM2-MDM4反馈环的所有五个基因-基因相互作用。

Conclusion: GAT框架能更好地利用生物通路结构信息，具有从实验数据生成新生物学假设的潜力。

Abstract: Biological pathways map gene-gene interactions that govern all human
processes. Despite their importance, most ML models treat genes as unstructured
tokens, discarding known pathway structure. The latest pathway-informed models
capture pathway-pathway interactions, but still treat each pathway as a "bag of
genes" via MLPs, discarding its topology and gene-gene interactions. We propose
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) framework that models pathways at the gene
level. We show that GATs generalize much better than MLPs, achieving an 81%
reduction in MSE when predicting pathway dynamics under unseen treatment
conditions. We further validate the correctness of our biological prior by
encoding drug mechanisms via edge interventions, boosting model robustness.
Finally, we show that our GAT model is able to correctly rediscover all five
gene-gene interactions in the canonical TP53-MDM2-MDM4 feedback loop from raw
time-series mRNA data, demonstrating potential to generate novel biological
hypotheses directly from experimental data.

TL;DR: 提出FedThief框架，在联邦学习中通过上传篡改内容降低全局模型性能，同时利用分歧感知集成技术提升攻击者私有模型性能，实现自利攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习攻击策略仅破坏全局模型性能，但攻击者自身模型也会受损。现实攻击者追求竞争优势，希望自己的模型优于其他参与者

Method: FedThief框架：上传阶段修改内容降低全局模型性能；使用分歧感知集成技术整合全局更新和本地知识来增强私有模型

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效降低全局模型性能，同时攻击者获得的集成模型显著优于全局模型

Conclusion: 提出了自中心联邦学习攻击新范式，攻击者既能破坏全局模型又能提升自身模型性能，揭示了联邦学习中的新安全威胁

Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be
directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing
attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the
global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private
models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by
self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by
developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to
cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated
Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the
performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own
models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named
FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading
modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the
private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where
"divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that
integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that
our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the
attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global
model.

*Lu Han,Mengyan Li,Jiping Qiang,Zhi Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ASC方法整合财务和文本数据，通过优化权重参数和特征向量选择，在中小企业信用监测中实现比基线方法高18%的轮廓系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构数据（数值财务变量和文本记录）对信用监测带来重大挑战，需要有效整合不同类型数据的方法。

Method: Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC)方法，通过优化权重参数整合财务和文本相似度，采用新颖的特征值-轮廓优化方法选择特征向量。

Result: 在1,428家中小企业数据集上，ASC比单类型数据基线方法轮廓系数高18%；低风险企业中51%包含'社会招聘'术语；招聘导向型中小企业违约风险低30%。

Conclusion: ASC通过将谱聚类理论与异构数据应用相结合，能够识别有意义的集群，支持更有针对性和有效的信用干预措施，并在多种聚类算法中表现出稳健性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Motivation: 传统决策树模型仅依赖数值变量，难以处理高维数据且无法有效整合文本信息，限制了中小企业信用评估的效果

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 矩阵分解将文本数据转为数值矩阵；2) Lasso回归选择重要财务特征；3) 基于基尼指数或熵构建多元分割树，采用最弱链接剪枝控制复杂度

Result: 在1,428家中国中小企业数据集上，IMST达到88.9%准确率，优于基准决策树(87.4%)、逻辑回归和SVM等传统模型

Conclusion: IMST框架不仅提升了准确率，还具有更好的可解释性和计算效率，模型结构更简洁，风险检测能力更强

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Motivation: 边缘计算环境下需要高效的模型压缩和推理速度，但传统MLP难以捕捉GNN学习的复杂邻域依赖关系，限制了在边缘设备上的性能表现。

Method: 提出SA-DSD知识蒸馏框架，改进FR-KAN为FR-KAN+作为学生模型，引入可学习频率基和相位偏移机制，构建基于师生预测一致性的采样概率矩阵和自适应加权损失机制。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上，SA-DSD相比三个GNN教师模型性能提升3.05%-3.62%，相比FR-KAN+提升15.61%，参数减少16.96倍，推理时间降低55.75%。

Conclusion: SA-DSD框架有效解决了GNN到高效模型的知识蒸馏问题，显著提升了边缘环境下的模型性能和效率，为消费电子设备中的深度学习部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is crucial for deploying deep learning models in
resource-constrained edge environments, particularly within the consumer
electronics sector, including smart home devices, wearable technology, and
mobile terminals. These applications place higher demands on model compression
and inference speed, necessitating the transfer of knowledge from Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to more efficient Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. However,
due to their fixed activation functions and fully connected architecture, MLPs
face challenges in rapidly capturing the complex neighborhood dependencies
learned by GNNs, thereby limiting their performance in edge environments. To
address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative from GNNs to
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) knowledge distillation framework-Self
Attention Dynamic Sampling Distillation (SA-DSD). This study improved Fourier
KAN (FR-KAN) and replaced MLP with the improved FR-KAN+ as the student model.
Through the incorporation of learnable frequency bases and phase-shift
mechanisms, along with algorithmic optimization, FR-KAN significantly improves
its nonlinear fitting capability while effectively reducing computational
complexity. Building on this, a margin-level sampling probability matrix, based
on teacher-student prediction consistency, is constructed, and an adaptive
weighted loss mechanism is designed to mitigate performance degradation in the
student model due to the lack of explicit neighborhood aggregation. Extensive
experiments conducted on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SA-DSD
achieves performance improvements of 3.05%-3.62% over three GNN teacher models
and 15.61% over the FR-KAN+ model. Moreover, when compared with key benchmark
models, SA-DSD achieves a 16.96x reduction in parameter count and a 55.75%
decrease in inference time.

Abstract: Quantifying transient causal interactions from non-stationary neural signals
is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Traditional methods are often
inadequate for brief neural events, and advanced, event-specific techniques
have lacked accessible implementations within the Python ecosystem. Here, we
introduce trancit (Transient Causal Interaction Toolbox), an open-source Python
package designed to bridge this gap. TranCIT implements a comprehensive
analysis pipeline, including Granger Causality, Transfer Entropy, and the more
robust Structural Causal Model-based Dynamic Causal Strength (DCS) and relative
Dynamic Causal Strength (rDCS) for accurately detecting event-driven causal
effects. We demonstrate TranCIT's utility by successfully capturing causality
in high-synchrony regimes where traditional methods fail and by identifying the
known transient information flow from hippocampal CA3 to CA1 during sharp-wave
ripple events in real-world data. The package offers a user-friendly, validated
solution for investigating the transient causal dynamics that govern complex
systems.

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific
downstream tasks has become crucial. This drives the need for robust
fine-tuning methods to address challenges such as model overfitting and sparse
labeling. Molecular graph foundation models (MGFMs) face unique difficulties
that complicate fine-tuning. These models are limited by smaller pre-training
datasets and more severe data scarcity for downstream tasks, both of which
require enhanced model generalization. Moreover, MGFMs must accommodate diverse
objectives, including both regression and classification tasks. To better
understand and improve fine-tuning techniques under these conditions, we
classify eight fine-tuning methods into three mechanisms: weight-based,
representation-based, and partial fine-tuning. We benchmark these methods on
downstream regression and classification tasks across supervised and
self-supervised pre-trained models in diverse labeling settings. This extensive
evaluation provides valuable insights and informs the design of a refined
robust fine-tuning method, ROFT-MOL. This approach combines the strengths of
simple post-hoc weight interpolation with more complex weight ensemble
fine-tuning methods, delivering improved performance across both task types
while maintaining the ease of use inherent in post-hoc weight interpolation.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet
accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear
couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron
Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations,
but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global
measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during
strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning
framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion
Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates
heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices,
and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment
strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves
robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as
3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest
predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers
interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational
applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and
community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the
open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

*Mengjie Zhao,Olga Fink*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的层次控制微分方程框架(H-CDE)，用于从传感器数据中推断系统退化过程，解决了运行变化和退化过程混合的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的残差方法在动态响应系统中导致噪声大、可靠性低的退化估计，而神经常微分方程在慢快系统中遇到数值突性和训练困难问题。

Method: 设计了包含慢速(退化)和快速(运行)CDE组件的统一架构，采用多尺度时间积分方案、可学习路径变换和新型激活函数来强制退化的单调性。

Result: 在动态响应(横梁)和稳态(航空发动机)系统上的综合评估显示，H-CDE能够有效分离退化和运行动态，性能超过残差基准方法。

Conclusion: H-CDE框架能够提供更准确、稳健和可解释的退化推断，为系统健康状态监测和预测保养领域带来重要进展。

Abstract: Reliable inference of system degradation from sensor data is fundamental to
condition monitoring and prognostics in engineered systems. Since degradation
is rarely observable and measurable, it must be inferred to enable accurate
health assessment and decision-making. This is particularly challenging because
operational variations dominate system behavior, while degradation introduces
only subtle, long-term changes. Consequently, sensor data mainly reflect
short-term operational variability, making it difficult to disentangle the
underlying degradation process. Residual-based methods are widely employed, but
the residuals remain entangled with operational history, often resulting in
noisy and unreliable degradation estimation, particularly in systems with
dynamic responses. Neural Ordinary Equations (NODEs) offer a promising
framework for inferring latent dynamics, but the time-scale separation in
slow-fast systems introduces numerical stiffness and complicates training,
while degradation disentanglement remains difficult. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Controlled Differential Equation
(H-CDE) framework that incorporates a slow (degradation) and a fast (operation)
CDE component in a unified architecture. It introduces three key innovations: a
multi-scale time integration scheme to mitigate numerical stiffness; a
learnable path transformation that extracts latent degradation drivers to
control degradation evolution; and a novel activation function that enforces
monotonicity on inferred degradation as a regularizer for disentanglement.
Through comprehensive evaluations on both dynamic response (e.g., bridges) and
steady state (e.g., aero-engine) systems, we demonstrate that H-CDE effectively
disentangles degradation from operational dynamics and outperforms
residual-based baselines, yielding more accurate, robust, and interpretable
inference.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

TL;DR: 提出了CAEL-MIPS方法，通过学习上下文-动作嵌入来最小化MIPS估计器的均方误差，解决了传统IPS方法在大动作空间或探索不足时的方差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IPS方法在大动作空间或探索不足的上下文-动作空间存在显著方差问题，现有的MIPS方法虽然利用动作嵌入缓解了这一问题，但未考虑上下文信息且未优化均方误差。

Method: 提出CAEL-MIPS方法，从离线数据中学习上下文-动作嵌入，基于MIPS的偏差和方差理论分析，构建最小化均方误差的目标函数。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验表明，该估计器在均方误差方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CAEL-MIPS通过联合学习上下文-动作嵌入有效降低了MIPS估计器的均方误差，为离线策略评估提供了更准确的估计方法。

Abstract: We consider off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandits with finite
action space. Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting is a widely used method
for OPE due to its unbiased, but it suffers from significant variance when the
action space is large or when some parts of the context-action space are
underexplored. Recently introduced Marginalized IPS (MIPS) estimators mitigate
this issue by leveraging action embeddings. However, these embeddings do not
minimize the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimators and do not consider
context information. To address these limitations, we introduce Context-Action
Embedding Learning for MIPS, or CAEL-MIPS, which learns context-action
embeddings from offline data to minimize the MSE of the MIPS estimator.
Building on the theoretical analysis of bias and variance of MIPS, we present
an MSE-minimizing objective for CAEL-MIPS. In the empirical studies on a
synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our estimator
outperforms baselines in terms of MSE.

Abstract: When working with tabular data, missingness is always one of the most painful
problems. Throughout many years, researchers have continuously explored better
and better ways to impute missing data. Recently, with the rapid development
evolution in machine learning and deep learning, there is a new trend of
leveraging generative models to solve the imputation task. While the imputing
version of famous models such as Variational Autoencoders or Generative
Adversarial Networks were investigated, prior work has overlooked Neural
Cellular Automata (NCA), a powerful computational model. In this paper, we
propose a novel imputation method that is inspired by NCA. We show that, with
some appropriate adaptations, an NCA-based model is able to address the missing
data imputation problem. We also provide several experiments to evidence that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation error and
post-imputation performance.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate
adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine
learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional
forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use
different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and
reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent.
IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution
regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and
probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To
establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across
diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks,
as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives.
While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other
geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model
implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future
development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing
regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有物理信息神经网络和算子学习方法（如DeepONet和Fourier神经算子）在平衡算子损失和物理损失、处理噪声稀疏数据、提供不确定性量化方面存在困难

Method: 集成进化多目标优化自适应平衡损失、副本交换随机梯度Langevin动力学改善参数空间探索、内置贝叶斯不确定性量化

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了现有算子学习方法的关键局限性，为参数化偏微分方程求解提供了更强大的工具

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization for
Replica-Exchange-based Physics-informed Operator learning Network, which is a
novel operator learning network to efficiently solve parametric partial
differential equations. In forward and inverse settings, this operator learning
network only admits minimum requirement of noisy observational data. While
physics-informed neural networks and operator learning approaches such as Deep
Operator Networks and Fourier Neural Operators offer promising alternatives to
traditional numerical solvers, they struggle with balancing operator and
physics losses, maintaining robustness under noisy or sparse data, and
providing uncertainty quantification. The proposed framework addresses these
limitations by integrating: (i) evolutionary multi-objective optimization to
adaptively balance operator and physics-based losses in the Pareto front; (ii)
replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to improve global
parameter-space exploration and accelerate convergence; and (iii) built-in
Bayesian uncertainty quantification from stochastic sampling. The proposed
operator learning method is tested numerically on several different problems
including one-dimensional Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed
diffusion-wave equation. The results indicate that our framework consistently
outperforms the general operator learning methods in accuracy, noise
robustness, and the ability to quantify uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在药物发现中，如何在低数据条件下高效引导生成模型探索药理学相关的化学空间是一个主要挑战。需要开发能够在有限训练数据下生成具有特定性质的新分子的方法。

Method: VECTOR+框架结合了属性引导的对比学习表示和可控分子生成，适用于回归和分类任务。通过属性指导来学习分子表示，然后基于这些表示生成目标性质的分子。

Result: 在PD-L1抑制剂数据集（296个化合物）上，生成的8374个分子中有100个超过对接阈值-15.0 kcal/mol，最佳得分-17.6 kcal/mol优于参考抑制剂（-15.4 kcal/mol）。分子动力学模拟证实结合稳定性（配体RMSD < 2.5埃）。在激酶抑制剂任务中也生成出比brigatinib和sorafenib等现有药物对接分数更好的化合物。

Conclusion: VECTOR+为低数据条件下的属性条件分子设计提供了一个稳健、可扩展的方法，成功桥接了对比学习和生成建模，实现了可重复的AI加速药物发现。

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant
regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery
under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive
Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples
property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation.
VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables
interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We
evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with
experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056
molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates
novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of
8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with
the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor
($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl
pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns)
confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes
to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than
established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE
and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity
highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our
work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design
in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for
reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出DELTA框架，通过两阶段变分解耦生成学习解决隐私保护数据重编程问题，在提升预测性能的同时显著降低隐私泄露风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据常包含敏感属性且受严格监管，现有特征工程主要关注下游任务性能而忽视隐私保护，需要新的方法来平衡效用和隐私

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用策略引导强化学习发现有用特征变换；第二阶段采用变分LSTM编码器-解码器，结合效用-隐私解耦潜在空间设计和对抗-因果解耦正则化

Result: 在8个数据集上实验显示，DELTA将预测性能提升约9.3%，隐私泄露减少约35%

Conclusion: DELTA框架能够有效实现隐私感知的数据转换，在保持高预测性能的同时显著降低隐私推断风险

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or
sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and
requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and
transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing
downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this
learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data
Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target
attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction
accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating
high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large
search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from
utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative
learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to
discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any
regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq
encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and
adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals
during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves
predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%,
demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

Motivation: 传统图神经网络在时空预测中存在频谱纠缠问题，而分解集成方法如VMGCN虽然提高了准确性，但存在计算效率低下和需要手动超参数调优的局限性。

Method: 提出了模式自适应图网络(MAGN)，包含：(1)展开式VMD模块，用固定深度网络替代迭代优化；(2)模式特定的可学习带宽约束，自适应空间异质性并防止频谱重叠。

Result: 在LargeST基准测试(6,902个传感器，2.41亿观测值)上，MAGN比VMGCN减少了85-95%的预测误差，分解时间减少了250倍，优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MAGN通过将传统信号分解方法转换为可训练的神经模块，有效解决了计算效率和参数调优问题，为复杂系统的时空预测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal forecasting is critical for numerous complex systems
but remains challenging due to complex volatility patterns and spectral
entanglement in conventional graph neural networks (GNNs). While
decomposition-integrated approaches like variational mode graph convolutional
network (VMGCN) improve accuracy through signal decomposition, they suffer from
computational inefficiency and manual hyperparameter tuning. To address these
limitations, we propose the mode adaptive graph network (MAGN) that transforms
iterative variational mode decomposition (VMD) into a trainable neural module.
Our key innovations include (1) an unfolded VMD (UVMD) module that replaces
iterative optimization with a fixed-depth network to reduce the decomposition
time (by 250x for the LargeST benchmark), and (2) mode-specific learnable
bandwidth constraints ({\alpha}k ) adapt spatial heterogeneity and eliminate
manual tuning while preventing spectral overlap. Evaluated on the LargeST
benchmark (6,902 sensors, 241M observations), MAGN achieves an 85-95% reduction
in the prediction error over VMGCN and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出BALD-GFlowNet框架，利用生成流网络（GFlowNets）直接按照BALD奖励的比例生成样本，替代传统的池式采集策略，使可扩展性与未标记池的大小无关。

Result: 在虚拟筛选实验中，BALD-GFlowNet实现了与标准BALD基线相当的性能，同时生成了结构更多样化的分子。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效、可扩展的分子发现提供了一个有前景的方向，解决了大规模主动学习的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational
cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly
acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies
such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative
samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries
containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a
generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method
leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in
proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition
with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is
independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening
experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to
that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse
molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular
discovery.

Conclusion: TAAM通过轻量级的任务特定模块有效引导GNN的推理过程，为导航稳定性-可塑性困境开辟了新路径，是一种高效且无需重放的持续图学习解决方案。

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while
retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph
applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The
Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance
between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The
Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on
extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource
burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies
not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically
modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that
lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning
process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive
Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new
path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural
Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to
store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these
modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a
similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it
selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a
frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its
internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.
Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂现实场景中表现出优越的有效性和鲁棒性，为不确定性信息建模提供了更丰富灵活的表示方式。

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) provides a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty and has been widely applied to multi-attribute classification
tasks. However, traditional DST-based attribute fusion-based classifiers suffer
from oversimplified membership function modeling and limited exploitation of
the belief structure brought by basic probability assignment (BPA), reducing
their effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios. This paper presents an
enhanced attribute fusion-based classifier that addresses these limitations
through two key innovations. First, we adopt a selective modeling strategy that
utilizes both single Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for membership
function construction, with model selection guided by cross-validation and a
tailored evaluation metric. Second, we introduce a novel method to transform
the possibility distribution into a BPA by combining simple BPAs derived from
normalized possibility distributions, enabling a much richer and more flexible
representation of uncertain information. Furthermore, we apply the belief
structure-based BPA generation method to the evidential K-Nearest Neighbors
classifier, enhancing its ability to incorporate uncertainty information into
decision-making. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets are conducted
to evaluate the performance of the proposed attribute fusion-based classifier
and the enhanced evidential K-Nearest Neighbors classifier in comparison with
both evidential classifiers and conventional machine learning classifiers. The
results demonstrate that our proposed classifier outperforms the best existing
evidential classifier, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.84%,
while maintaining low variance, thus confirming its superior effectiveness and
robustness.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异质图（heterophilic graphs）中结合边缘方向性和表达能力强的消息传递对节点分类的影响，提出了两种多项式表达能力强的GNN架构，在多个基准数据集上取得了先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在异质图中表现不佳，因为它们依赖于局部同质邻域。先前研究表明建模边缘方向性可以提高有效同质性，而多项式表达能力强的GNN可以捕捉高阶特征交互。本文旨在研究这两者的结合效果。

Method: 提出了两种架构：(1) 多项式表达能力强的GAT基线模型(Poly)，(2) 方向感知变体(Dir-Poly)，分别聚合传入和传出边缘。两种模型都能学习输入特征的置换等变高次多项式，且保持可扩展性。

Result: 在五个基准异质图数据集上的实验表明，Poly模型始终优于现有基线，Dir-Poly在具有固有方向性的图上（如Roman Empire）提供额外增益，达到最先进结果。但在无向图上引入人工方向性并不总是有帮助。

Conclusion: 边缘方向和表达能力强的特征建模在异质图学习中具有互补作用，方向性消息传递的益处是情境依赖的。

Abstract: In heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often belong to different
classes, conventional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) struggle due to their
reliance on local homophilous neighborhoods. Prior studies suggest that
modeling edge directionality in such graphs can increase effective homophily
and improve classification performance. Simultaneously, recent work on
polynomially expressive GNNs shows promise in capturing higher-order
interactions among features. In this work, we study the combined effect of edge
directionality and expressive message passing on node classification in
heterophilic graphs. Specifically, we propose two architectures: (1) a
polynomially expressive GAT baseline (Poly), and (2) a direction-aware variant
(Dir-Poly) that separately aggregates incoming and outgoing edges. Both models
are designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over
input features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.
Experiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model
consistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers
additional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),
achieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,
introducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the
benefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings
highlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature
modeling in heterophilic graph learning.

*Jakob De Moor,Hans Weytjens,Johannes De Smedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProCause是一个新的生成式深度学习方法，用于评估规范性流程监控方法，通过整合多种因果推理架构和时序模型来解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RealCause方法忽略了流程数据中的时序依赖性，且仅依赖单一因果推理模型架构(TARNet)，限制了评估效果。需要开发一个更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出ProCause方法，支持序列模型(如LSTM)和非序列模型，整合多种因果推理架构(S-Learner、T-Learner、TARNet和集成模型)。

Result: 研究表明TARNet并非总是最佳选择，模型集成提供更一致的可靠性，LSTM在处理时序依赖性时能改善评估效果。通过真实数据分析验证了ProCause的实用性。

Conclusion: ProCause为规范性流程监控方法提供了更可靠的评估框架，通过多架构集成和时序建模能力，显著提升了评估的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining
that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on
event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of
ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative
deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has
been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions
to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal
dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture,
TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce
ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and
non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner,
T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known
ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an
ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs
shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are
present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a
real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM
methods.

Abstract: At the intersection of the cutting-edge technologies and privacy concerns,
Federated Learning (FL) with its distributed architecture, stands at the
forefront in a bid to facilitate collaborative model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy. However, the applicability of FL systems
is hindered by fairness concerns arising from numerous sources of heterogeneity
that can result in biases and undermine a system's effectiveness, with skewed
predictions, reduced accuracy, and inefficient model convergence. This survey
thus explores the diverse sources of bias, including but not limited to, data,
client, and model biases, and thoroughly discusses the strengths and
limitations inherited within the array of the state-of-the-art techniques
utilized in the literature to mitigate such disparities in the FL training
process. We delineate a comprehensive overview of the several notions,
theoretical underpinnings, and technical aspects associated with fairness and
their adoption in FL-based multidisciplinary environments. Furthermore, we
examine salient evaluation metrics leveraged to measure fairness
quantitatively. Finally, we envisage exciting open research directions that
have the potential to drive future advancements in achieving fairer FL
frameworks, in turn, offering a strong foundation for future research in this
pivotal area.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in the automotive industry
for applications such as driving style classification, which aims to improve
road safety, efficiency, and personalize user experiences. While deep learning
(DL) models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, excel at this
task, their black-box nature limits interpretability and trust. This paper
proposes a machine learning (ML)-based method that balances high accuracy with
interpretability. We introduce a high-quality dataset, CARLA-Drive, and
leverage ML techniques like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (XGBoost),
and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which are efficient, lightweight, and
interpretable. In addition, we apply the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)
explainability technique to provide personalized recommendations for safer
driving. Achieving an accuracy of 0.92 on a three-class classification task
with both RF and XGBoost classifiers, our approach matches DL models in
performance while offering transparency and practicality for real-world
deployment in intelligent transportation systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为分子组装和晶体结构预测提供了更高效准确的解决方案，展示了简单而有效的设计在复杂任务中的优势

Abstract: Crystalline structure prediction remains an open challenge in materials
design. Despite recent advances in computational materials science, accurately
predicting the three-dimensional crystal structures of organic materials--an
essential first step for designing materials with targeted properties--remains
elusive. In this work, we address the problem of molecular assembly, where a
set $\mathcal{S}$ of identical rigid molecules is packed to form a crystalline
structure. Existing state-of-the-art models typically rely on computationally
expensive, iterative flow-matching approaches. We propose a novel loss function
that correctly captures key geometric molecular properties while maintaining
permutation invariance over $\mathcal{S}$. We achieve this via a differentiable
linear assignment scheme based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Remarkably, we show
that even a simple regression using our method {\em SinkFast} significantly
outperforms more complex flow-matching approaches on the COD-Cluster17
benchmark, a curated subset of the Crystallography Open Database (COD).

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证表明，Causal SHAP能够减少仅与目标相关的特征的重要性评分

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释AI提供了实用的因果感知模型解释框架，特别适用于医疗等需要理解真实因果关系的领域

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models
are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While
SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability,
it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often
misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We
propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships
into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By
combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the
Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal
strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP.
Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are
merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of
Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model
explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as
healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for
informed decision-making.

Method: 使用半监督多模态神经网络（Transformer+LSTM+ANN），基于1041名中学生的离线教育数据，将各类获奖记录聚类为才能类别，并从多样化学习行为中提取特征。

Result: 模型取得了0.908的分类准确率和0.908的ROCAUC值，表现出优秀的预测性能。

Abstract: Talent identification plays a critical role in promoting student development.
However, traditional approaches often rely on manual processes or focus
narrowly on academic achievement, and typically delaying intervention until the
higher education stage. This oversight overlooks diverse non-academic talents
and misses opportunities for early intervention. To address this gap, this
study introduces TalentPredictor, a novel semi-supervised multi-modal neural
network that combines Transformer, LSTM, and ANN architectures. This model is
designed to predict seven different talent types--academic, sport, art,
leadership, service, technology, and others--in secondary school students
within an offline educational setting. Drawing on existing offline educational
data from 1,041 local secondary students, TalentPredictor overcomes the
limitations of traditional talent identification methods. By clustering various
award records into talent categories and extracting features from students'
diverse learning behaviors, it achieves high prediction accuracy (0.908
classification accuracy, 0.908 ROCAUC). This demonstrates the potential of
machine learning to identify diverse talents early in student development.

propose a novel guided reverse process for categorical features based on an
approximation to the Gumbel-softmax distribution. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the temperature $\tau$ and derive a theoretical bound between the
Gumbel-softmax distribution and our proposed approximated distribution. We
perform experiments on several large-scale credit lending and other tabular
datasets, assessing their performance in terms of the quantitative measures of
interpretability, diversity, instability, and validity. These results indicate
that our approach outperforms popular baseline methods, producing robust and
realistic counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community
where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an
important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have
leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper,
we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the
auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting
model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to
overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for
searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm
for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while
searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several
large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods.
The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and

TL;DR: DTRNet是一种改进的Transformer架构，通过动态令牌路由机制，让大多数令牌跳过二次成本的交叉令牌混合，同时保持线性更新，显著降低计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在每个层对每个令牌都应用二次自注意力计算，计算成本高昂。需要一种更高效的架构来减少计算开销，同时保持性能。

Method: 引入动态令牌路由网络(DTRNet)，保留MLP模块，对大多数令牌将注意力成本降低到线性。通过路由机制，只有约10%的令牌在每个层经过完整的注意力计算。

Result: DTRNet在保持与完整Transformer相当性能的同时，显著降低了计算量。在相同FLOPs下，比MoD和D-LLM等基于路由的层跳过方法在准确性和内存方面表现更好。

Conclusion: DTRNet通过将令牌更新与注意力混合解耦，大幅减少了二次计算份额，为Transformer提供了简单、高效且可扩展的替代方案，特别适用于长上下文输入。

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

Motivation: 图神经网络难以解释，因为消息传递混合了信号且内部通道很少与人类概念对齐，需要研究潜在空间中的特征叠加现象

Method: 使用具有明确图概念的受控实验，在图形级别提取类条件质心特征，在节点级别提取线性探测方向特征，并用简单的基不变诊断分析其几何结构

Result: 发现增加宽度会产生重叠的相位模式；拓扑将重叠印记到节点级特征中；更锐利的池化增加轴对齐并减少通道共享；浅层模型可能陷入亚稳态低秩嵌入

Conclusion: 这些结果将表示几何与具体设计选择联系起来，并提出了实现更可解释图神经网络的实际方法

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message
passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts.
We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features,
directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with
unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional
centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node
level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics.
Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in
overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling
partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis
alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into
metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry
with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and
suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种混合架构，通过分段压缩和稀疏注意力机制，在保持Transformer表达能力的同时大幅降低计算和内存成本，实现了长序列建模的高效处理。


<details>

Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次注意力复杂度限制了长序列的可扩展性，而线性模型如Mamba和滑动窗口注意力虽然效率高，但在长序列上可能因无法保留远距离令牌的详细信息而性能下降。

Method: 提出SCOUT架构：1）使用线性局部混合器（Mamba或SWA）在固定大小的段内压缩令牌；2）每个令牌稀疏地关注少量压缩的检查点令牌来总结输入历史；3）只在压缩表示上应用注意力。

Result: 在相同计算预算下，SCOUT在长上下文语言建模和推理任务上优于强基线；在4亿和13亿参数规模上，在语言建模和常识推理任务上匹配全注意力Transformer；相比SOTA模型具有更高的端到端吞吐量。

Conclusion: SCOUT通过混合压缩和注意力机制，在保持性能的同时实现了计算效率的显著提升，为长序列处理提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of
sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits
scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window
attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized
operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However,
these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their
inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT
(Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid
architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and
applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token
embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that
integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens,
each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens
that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity
of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory
cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT
incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate
remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We
analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically
on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba
and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same
computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling
and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT
achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering
comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重采样方法使用固定分布，忽略了类别学习难度的变化，限制了模型性能

Method: ART方法定期基于类别宏F1分数更新训练数据分布，在类别级别进行自适应调整，而非实例级别

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ART始终优于重采样和算法级方法，平均提高宏F1分数2.64个百分点，统计显著

Conclusion: ART是一种可靠的不平衡分类方法，能够一致地提供最强的宏F1性能，优于现有方法

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses
fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority.
These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which
can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that
periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the
class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1
scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to
be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and
outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to
incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that
better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast
dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and
algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
(SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well
as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On
tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests
(p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to
training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average
of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing
methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the
strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model
personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning.
However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated
learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated
learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning,
such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data
distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in
real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine
clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only
when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of
clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients
within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is
possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients'
behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to
achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated
multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency
when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients.
Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the
received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a
trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration.
Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a
Byzantine-free setting.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture

TL;DR: FlexMDM是一种灵活的掩码扩散模型，能够处理可变长度序列生成，解决了传统MDM只能生成固定长度序列的限制，在数学和代码填充任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型(MDMs)虽然支持并行推理且性能强劲，但无法支持token插入操作，只能生成固定长度的序列，这限制了其在需要可变长度生成任务中的应用

Method: 基于随机插值框架扩展，FlexMDM通过在序列中插入掩码token并逐步去掩码的方式来生成可变长度序列，同时保留了MDM的任何顺序推理灵活性

Result: FlexMDM在困惑度上与MDM相当，但在长度统计建模上保真度更高；在迷宫规划任务中成功率比MDM基线提高约60%；将LLaDA-8B微调为FlexMDM后，在数学(GSM8K从58%到67%)和代码填充(从52%到65%)任务上性能显著提升

Conclusion: FlexMDM成功解决了离散扩散模型在可变长度序列生成方面的关键限制，为扩散模型在更广泛序列生成任务中的应用开辟了新途径

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models over discrete domains. MDMs generate
sequences in an any-order, parallel fashion, enabling fast inference and strong
performance on non-causal tasks. However, a crucial limitation is that they do
not support token insertions and are thus limited to fixed-length generations.
To this end, we introduce Flexible Masked Diffusion Models (FlexMDMs), a
discrete diffusion paradigm that simultaneously can model sequences of flexible
length while provably retaining MDMs' flexibility of any-order inference.
Grounded in an extension of the stochastic interpolant framework, FlexMDMs
generate sequences by inserting mask tokens and unmasking them. Empirically, we
show that FlexMDMs match MDMs in perplexity while modeling length statistics
with much higher fidelity. On a synthetic maze planning task, they achieve
$\approx 60 \%$ higher success rate than MDM baselines. Finally, we show
pretrained MDMs can easily be retrofitted into FlexMDMs: on 16 H100s, it takes
only three days to fine-tune LLaDA-8B into a FlexMDM, achieving superior
performance on math (GSM8K, $58\% \to 67\%$) and code infilling performance
($52\% \to 65\%$).

TL;DR: 提出TPRL-DG框架，使用强化学习和Transformer来自动提取用户无关的时序特征，解决可穿戴传感器人体活动识别中的跨用户泛化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法在人体活动识别中容易过拟合到特定用户的模式，现有域泛化方法往往忽略时序依赖或需要不切实际的域标签

Method: 基于强化学习的时序保持域泛化框架，使用Transformer自回归生成器产生时序token，通过多目标奖励函数平衡类别判别和跨用户不变性

Result: 在DSADS和PAMAP2数据集上超越现有最优方法，实现更好的跨用户泛化性能，无需逐用户校准

Conclusion: 通过学习鲁棒的用户无关时序模式，TPRL-DG能够实现可扩展的人体活动识别系统，推动个性化医疗和自适应健身追踪的发展

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for
healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user
variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and
physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings.
Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific
patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain
generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal
dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose
Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a
novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential
decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a
Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that
capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective
reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key
innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2)
autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a
label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations.
Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior
accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant
temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating
advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and
context-aware environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于大腦模型LaBraM的相關性注意力映射方法，利用IMU數據的空間通道關係來識別EEG信號中的運動偽影，相比傳統單模態方法顯著提升運動場景下的魯棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信號易受運動偽影污染，現有方法多為單模態處理（如ASR、ICA），未充分利用IMU等同步記錄的運動信息，限制了腦機接口在真實場景中的部署。

Method: 使用精調的大型腦模型LaBraM，通過相關性注意力映射分析IMU數據的空間通道關係，識別EEG中的運動相關偽影。模型僅需5.9小時EEG-IMU數據訓練（佔基礎模型訓練數據的0.2346%）。

Result: 在不同時間尺度和運動活動下，與ASR-ICA基準相比，引入IMU參考信號顯著提高了多種運動場景下的魯棒性。

Conclusion: 融合IMU運動信息的多模態方法能有效提升EEG運動偽影去除效果，為腦機接口的實際應用提供了更可靠的解決方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring brain
activity with high temporal resolution; however, EEG signals often exhibit low
signal-to-noise ratios because of contamination from physiological and
environmental artifacts. One of the major challenges hindering the real-world
deployment of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) involves the frequent occurrence
of motion-related EEG artifacts. Most prior studies on EEG motion artifact
removal rely on single-modality approaches, such as Artifact Subspace
Reconstruction (ASR) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), without
incorporating simultaneously recorded modalities like inertial measurement
units (IMUs), which directly capture the extent and dynamics of motion. This
work proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation
attention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU
data to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model
contains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU
recordings for training, just 0.2346\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base
model. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across
varying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU
reference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion
scenarios.

Motivation: 小语言模型在生成概率程序时经常产生语法和语义错误，如错误的推断结构。受概率程序员的领域专业知识和调试策略启发，需要一种方法来确保生成的程序包含有效分布和良好参数。

Method: 引入RefineStat框架，强制执行语义约束确保合成程序包含有效分布和良好参数，并在可靠性检查失败时应用诊断感知细化，重新采样先验或似然组件。

Result: 在多个概率编程代码生成任务上评估显示，RefineStat生成的程序既语法正确又统计可靠，性能常常匹配或超过闭源大语言模型（如OpenAI o3）。

Conclusion: RefineStat框架有效解决了小语言模型生成概率程序时的可靠性问题，通过约束和细化机制显著提升了生成程序的质量和统计可靠性。

Abstract: Probabilistic programming offers a powerful framework for modeling
uncertainty, yet statistical model discovery in this domain entails navigating
an immense search space under strict domain-specific constraints. When small
language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they
frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors,
such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers'
domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language
model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized
programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then
applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood
components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple
probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models
(SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and
statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source
large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时间序列异常检测评估指标存在四个主要问题：识别力不足、强超参依赖性、对干扰敏感性和高计算开销。这些限制了模型评估的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出信心一致性评估(CCE)指标，利用贝叶斯估计来量化异常分数的不确定性。通过构建全局和事件级别的信心一致性分数，形成简洁的CCE指标。同时建立RankEval标准化评测流程，用于比较不同评估指标的排名能力。

Conclusion: CCE指标有效解决了现有时间序列异常检测评估指标的四大问题，提供了一种具有严格数学性质和高效计算的评估方法。RankEval标准化评测流程为领域提供了可靠的评估基准。

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model
evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations:
insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency,
sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper
introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric
that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency.
By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores,
we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for
model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and
experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz
robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity
$\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing
the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first
standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective
comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are
fully open-source.

Method: 提出SC-GIR框架，利用自监督学习提取与下游任务无关的不变表征，采用协方差基对比学习技术获取语义密集的潜在表征，并在图像数据集上进行有损压缩测试。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行广泛实验，SC-GIR超过基线方案近了10%，在不同SNR条件下对压缩数据达到超过85%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 证明了SC-GIR框架在学习紧凑且信息丰富的潜在表征方面的有效性，为目标导向语义通信系统提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication
systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current
approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to
redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their
task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for
image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract
an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the
source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed
representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features
for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks,
we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent
representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to
various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations
are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several
datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,,
and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under
different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

Conclusion: MATL-DC框架有效解决了未见目标域的EEG情绪识别问题，通过域-类原型实现了高性能的情绪分类，具有重要的实际应用价值

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is
increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer
Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly
depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical
application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain
Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with
Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature
decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from
domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training
stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature
space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional
EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype
representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning
strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity
problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of
label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen
during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained
domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We
rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and
SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%,
68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better
performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的performative prediction研究主要依赖不可控假设（如梯度有界）且多局限于线性情况，而现实世界数据通常具有复杂的非线性特征，需要更通用的方法。

Method: 采用最大间隔方法构建损失函数，通过核方法扩展到非线性空间，使用预测误差差异量化数据分布偏移，并推导performative稳定性的条件。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将performative prediction推广到非线性情况，保持了关键理论性质，并提供了实用的算法保证，为实际应用提供了更好的理论基础。

Abstract: Performative prediction is an emerging paradigm in machine learning that
addresses scenarios where the model's prediction may induce a shift in the
distribution of the data it aims to predict. Current works in this field often
rely on uncontrollable assumptions, such as bounded gradients of performative
loss, and primarily focus on linear cases in their examples and evaluations to
maintain consistency between theoretical guarantees and empirical validations.
However, such linearity rarely holds in real-world applications, where the data
usually exhibit complex nonlinear characteristics. In this paper, we relax
these out-of-control assumptions and present a novel design that generalizes
performative prediction to nonlinear cases while preserving essential
theoretical properties. Specifically, we formulate the loss function of
performative prediction using a maximum margin approach and extend it to
nonlinear spaces through kernel methods. To quantify the data distribution
shift, we employ the discrepancy between prediction errors on these two
distributions as an indicator, which characterizes the impact of the
performative effect on specific learning tasks. By doing so, we can derive, for
both linear and nonlinear cases, the conditions for performative stability, a
critical and desirable property in performative contexts. Building on these
theoretical insights, we develop an algorithm that guarantees the performative
stability of the predictive model. We validate the effectiveness of our method
through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets with both linear and
nonlinear data distributions, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be highly effective in various
graph learning tasks. A key characteristic of GNNs is their use of a fixed
number of message-passing steps for all nodes in the graph, regardless of each
node's diverse computational needs and characteristics. Through empirical
real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal number of
message-passing layers varies for nodes with different characteristics. This
finding is further supported by experiments conducted on synthetic datasets. To
address this, we propose Adaptive Depth Message Passing GNN (ADMP-GNN), a novel
framework that dynamically adjusts the number of message passing layers for
each node, resulting in improved performance. This approach applies to any
model that follows the message passing scheme. We evaluate ADMP-GNN on the node

Conclusion: StoxLSTM通过将随机性引入xLSTM架构，成功提升了时间序列建模的性能，为复杂动态系统的建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network has attracted widespread
research interest due to its enhanced capability to model complex temporal
dependencies in diverse time series applications. Despite its success, there is
still potential to further improve its representational capacity and
forecasting performance, particularly on challenging real-world datasets with
unknown, intricate, and hierarchical dynamics. In this work, we propose a
stochastic xLSTM, termed StoxLSTM, that improves the original architecture into
a state space modeling framework by incorporating stochastic latent variables
within xLSTM. StoxLSTM models the latent dynamic evolution through specially
designed recurrent blocks, enabling it to effectively capture the underlying
temporal patterns and dependencies. Extensive experiments on publicly available

TL;DR: 提出Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL)损失函数，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵差异来保持向量空间正交性和线性独立性等关键属性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维度降低会扭曲向量空间的正交性和线性独立性等关键属性，这些属性对于跨模态检索、聚类和分类等任务至关重要

Method: 使用关系保持损失(RPL)，通过最小化高维数据和低维嵌入之间的关系矩阵（如Gram矩阵或余弦矩阵）差异来训练神经网络进行非线性投影，并基于矩阵扰动理论推导误差界限

Result: 初步实验表明，RPL在减少嵌入维度的同时，很大程度上保留了在下游任务上的性能，这主要归功于其对关键向量空间属性的保持

Conclusion: RPL不仅可用于维度降低，还可广泛应用于跨域对齐和迁移学习、知识蒸馏、公平性和不变性、去中心化、图和流形学习以及联邦学习等领域，确保分布式嵌入保持几何一致性

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as
orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including
cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a
Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these
properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g.,
Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings.
RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error
bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest
that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on
downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space
properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction,
this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain
alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and
invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning,
where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解学习的物理机制提供了新视角，促进了生物智能与人工智能系统的对齐，同时减少了表征干扰

Abstract: How to balance training accuracy and adversarial robustness has become a
challenge since the birth of deep learning. Here, we introduce a geometry-aware
deep learning framework that leverages layer-wise local training to sculpt the
internal representations of deep neural networks. This framework promotes
intra-class compactness and inter-class separation in feature space, leading to
manifold smoothness and adversarial robustness against white or black box
attacks. The performance can be explained by an energy model with Hebbian
coupling between elements of the hidden representation. Our results thus shed
light on the physics of learning in the direction of alignment between
biological and artificial intelligence systems. Using the current framework,
the deep network can assimilate new information into existing knowledge
structures while reducing representation interference.

### [126] [What Expressivity Theory Misses: Message Passing Complexity for GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01254)
*Niklas Kemper,Tom Wollschläger,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出消息传递复杂度(MPC)作为图神经网络表达能力理论的新框架，认为当前过度追求表达力的研究方向存在误导性，MPC能更好地反映GNN在实际任务中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GNN研究过度关注表达能力理论，但该理论存在两个主要问题：1）大多数实际任务并不需要超越基本WL测试的表达力；2）表达能力理论的二元分类和理想化假设无法准确反映GNN的实际能力。

Method: 提出消息传递复杂度(MPC)这一连续度量方法，量化GNN架构通过消息传递解决特定任务的难度，同时捕捉过压缩等实际限制，并保留表达能力理论中的理论不可能性结果。

Result: 通过在基础GNN任务上的广泛验证，MPC的理论预测与实证性能相关，成功解释了架构的成功和失败案例。

Conclusion: MPC超越了表达能力理论，为理解和改进GNN架构提供了更强大和细致的框架，有效缩小了理论与实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Expressivity theory, characterizing which graphs a GNN can distinguish, has
become the predominant framework for analyzing GNNs, with new models striving
for higher expressivity. However, we argue that this focus is misguided: First,
higher expressivity is not necessary for most real-world tasks as these tasks
rarely require expressivity beyond the basic WL test. Second, expressivity
theory's binary characterization and idealized assumptions fail to reflect
GNNs' practical capabilities. To overcome these limitations, we propose Message
Passing Complexity (MPC): a continuous measure that quantifies the difficulty
for a GNN architecture to solve a given task through message passing. MPC
captures practical limitations like over-squashing while preserving the
theoretical impossibility results from expressivity theory, effectively
narrowing the gap between theory and practice. Through extensive validation on
fundamental GNN tasks, we show that MPC's theoretical predictions correlate
with empirical performance, successfully explaining architectural successes and
failures. Thereby, MPC advances beyond expressivity theory to provide a more
powerful and nuanced framework for understanding and improving GNN
architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过共享约束向量实现隐式协调，解决边缘计算中资源竞争问题，在有限通信条件下优于集中式和独立基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘计算系统中，自主智能体需要在有限可观测性和通信约束下快速做出本地决策并竞争共享资源。现有MARL方法依赖集中式评论家或频繁通信，无法满足这些约束条件。

Method: 每个智能体解决一个约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)，通过共享约束向量进行隐式协调。约束条件防止共享服务器资源过载，约束向量不频繁更新，作为轻量级协调机制。使用安全强化学习使智能体学习满足本地和全局目标的策略。

Result: 在温和假设下建立了理论保证，实验验证表明该方法在性能上优于集中式和独立基线方法，特别是在大规模设置中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 提出的去中心化框架通过共享约束向量实现有效的隐式协调，在有限通信条件下能够同时满足本地决策需求和全局资源使用目标，为边缘计算系统中的多智能体资源竞争问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions
while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to
centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited
observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized
framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process
(CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the
specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared
server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as
a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global
resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe
reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global
goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate
our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and
independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Motivation: LLMs在需要组合规则和处理分布外示例的系统泛化任务中表现不佳，特别是在数学推理方面存在显著挑战。

Method: 采用迭代示例选择策略，逐步构建针对特定任务优化的少样本示例集，并结合显式推理指令来增强模型性能。

Result: 实验表明LLMs在数学任务中能力有限，但通过该方法显著提升了泛化性能，且简单示例比复杂示例效果更好。

Conclusion: 迭代示例选择策略能有效提升LLMs的系统泛化能力，特别是在处理非标准数学规则时，简单示例的选择策略对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: LLMs face significant challenges in systematic generalization, particularly
when dealing with reasoning tasks requiring compositional rules and handling
out-of-distribution examples. To address these challenges, we introduce an
in-context learning methodology that improves the generalization capabilities
of general purpose LLMs. Our approach employs an iterative example selection
strategy, which incrementally constructs a tailored set of few-shot examples
optimized to enhance model's performance on a given task. As a proof of
concept, we apply this methodology to the resolution of algebraic expressions
involving non-standard simplification rules, according to which the priority of
addition and multiplication is changed.
  Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit limited proficiency in these
mathematical tasks. We further demonstrate that LLMs reasoning benefits from
our iterative shot selection prompting strategy integrated with explicit
reasoning instructions. Crucially, our experiments reveal that some LLMs
achieve better generalization performances when prompted with simpler few-shot
examples rather than complex ones following the test data distribution.

Conclusion: 该方法改进了现有技术水平，为在复杂仿真器上应用代理辅助的强化学习策略优化铺平了道路

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a
common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number
of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide
state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to
efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies
trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these
surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or
Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled
datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples
acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the
regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the
best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space
representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the
state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of
surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on
complex simulators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种等变U型神经算子(E-UNO)，用于学习Cahn-Hilliard方程控制的相分离过程，通过结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率架构，实现了对相场变量演化的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高且缺乏灵活性，现有神经算子架构无法有效捕捉多尺度行为且忽略物理对称性，需要开发更高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用等变U型神经算子(E-UNO)，结合全局谱卷积和多分辨率U型架构，通过调节平移等变性来符合底层物理规律，从短历史动态中学习相场演化。

Result: E-UNO在精细尺度和高频结构上优于标准傅里叶神经算子和U型神经算子基线，具有更好的泛化能力、更少的训练数据需求和物理一致的动力学行为。

Conclusion: E-UNO通过编码对称性和尺度层次结构，成为复杂相场系统的高效替代模型，为材料科学和软物质中的界面动力学提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: Phase separation in binary mixtures, governed by the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
plays a central role in interfacial dynamics across materials science and soft
matter. While numerical solvers are accurate, they are often computationally
expensive and lack flexibility across varying initial conditions and
geometries. Neural operators provide a data-driven alternative by learning
solution operators between function spaces, but current architectures often
fail to capture multiscale behavior and neglect underlying physical symmetries.
Here we show that an equivariant U-shaped neural operator (E-UNO) can learn the
evolution of the phase-field variable from short histories of past dynamics,
achieving accurate predictions across space and time. The model combines global
spectral convolution with a multi-resolution U-shaped architecture and
regulates translation equivariance to align with the underlying physics. E-UNO
outperforms standard Fourier neural operator and U-shaped neural operator
baselines, particularly on fine-scale and high-frequency structures. By
encoding symmetry and scale hierarchy, the model generalizes better, requires
less training data, and yields physically consistent dynamics. This establishes
E-UNO as an efficient surrogate for complex phase-field systems.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于重构不确定性估计(RUE)的预测区间方法，用于生命体征预测中的不确定性量化，以提高临床决策的可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生命体征预测中表现出潜力，但由于缺乏可靠的不确定性量化（特别是校准的预测区间），临床医生难以信任和解释模型输出，阻碍了临床决策

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）参数化方法-假设预测误差和不确定性估计服从高斯copula分布，实现闭式预测区间计算；2）非参数化方法-基于K近邻算法，使用相似验证实例经验估计条件误差分布

Result: 在两个大型公共数据集（分钟级和小时级采样）上的实验表明，高斯copula方法在低频数据上持续优于conformal prediction基线，而KNN方法在高频数据上表现最佳

Conclusion: RUE衍生的预测区间方法在提供可解释、不确定性感知的生命体征预测方面具有临床前景

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators
of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and
decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting
these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because
clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable
uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals
(PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a
meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical
decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from
the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure
well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and
support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that
prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula
distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach,
based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional
error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these
methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling,
representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate
that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction
baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on
high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of
RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign
forecasts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模推理模型使用RLVR方法需要大量计算资源和数据集，导致训练成本高、数据效率低，需要更高效的数据选择策略来降低这些成本。

Method: 提出DEPO管道，包含两个阶段：离线阶段基于多样性、影响力和适当难度筛选高质量训练样本子集；在线阶段引入样本级可探索性指标动态过滤低探索潜力样本，并加入回放机制确保充分训练。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，DEPO始终优于现有方法。仅使用20%训练数据，在AIME24上实现1.85倍加速，在AIME25上实现1.66倍加速。

Conclusion: DEPO通过高效的数据选择策略显著提高了RLVR训练的数据效率和计算效率，在减少数据使用的同时保持了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业级电池管理涉及多种任务类型，每个任务使用不同的时间尺度、传感器分辨率和数据通道。构建任务特定方法需要大量数据和工程努力，限制了智能电池管理的可扩展性。

Method: 提出灵活掩码自编码器（FMAE）框架，能够学习缺失电池数据通道的统一表征，捕捉数据片段间的相互关联。

Result: FMAE在5个电池管理任务和11个电池数据集上始终优于所有任务特定方法。在剩余寿命预测任务中，使用50倍少的推理数据仍保持最先进结果。当真实数据缺乏某些信息时，FMAE仍可应用且性能影响很小。

Conclusion: FMAE展示了一条实用的路线，为动态系统的多任务管理提供了一个灵活、数据高效的模型，简化了真实世界的电池管理。

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as
estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs
distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels.
Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering
effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we
present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining
framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture
inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery
representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks
with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently
outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with
eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times
less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when
real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can
still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results
with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a
flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management
of dynamical systems.

Abstract: Modern optimization faces a fundamental challenge: local gradient-based
methods provide no global information about the objective function $L$
landscape, often leading to suboptimal convergence and sensitivity to
initialization. We introduce a novel optimization framework that leverages
resurgence theory from complex analysis to extract global structural
information from divergent asymptotic series. Our key insight is that the
factorially divergent perturbative expansions of parameter space partition
functions encode precise information about all critical objective function
value in the landscape through their Borel transform singularities.
  The algorithm works by computing the statistical mechanical partition
function $Z(g) = \int e^{-L(\theta)/g} d\theta$ for small coupling $g\ll 1$,
extracting its asymptotic series coefficients, and identifying Borel plane
singularities that correspond one-to-one with critical objective function
values. These target values provide global guidance to local optimizers,
enabling principled learning rate adaptation and escape from suboptimal
regions. Unlike heuristic adaptive methods, targets are theoretically grounded
in the geometry of the optimization landscape.

Conclusion: AT损失函数有效解决了CSI在干旱期的局限性，为降水预测提供了更可靠的优化标准。

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the
context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have
recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods
such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many
recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more
advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical
success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective
during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,
rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this
limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a
quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the
resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential
(AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss
demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast
performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the
operational model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal
impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis
using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying
interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the
predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and
second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect
the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)
to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able
to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely
locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced
by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the
large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia
Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact
and improve predictive performance.

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models
predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration
into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a
holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and
deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data
processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data
processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning
strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of
instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism
for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress
noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model
deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training
data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which
involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database
construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy
leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM
significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM
to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts.
Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Abstract: Nowadays, the nanostructure inverse problem is an attractive problem that
helps researchers to understand the relationship between the properties and the
structure of nanomaterials. This article focuses on the problem of using PDF to
recover the nanostructure, which this article views as a conditional generation
problem. This article propose a deep learning model CbLDM, Condition-based
Latent Diffusion Model. Based on the original latent diffusion model, the
sampling steps of the diffusion model are reduced and the sample generation
efficiency is improved by using the conditional prior to estimate conditional
posterior distribution, which is the approximated distribution of p(z|x). In
addition, this article uses the Laplacian matrix instead of the distance matrix
to recover the nanostructure, which can reduce the reconstruction error.
Finally, this article compares CbLDM with existing models which were used to
solve the nanostructure inverse problem, and find that CbLDM demonstrates
significantly higher prediction accuracy than these models, which reflects the
ability of CbLDM to solve the nanostructure inverse problem and the potential
to cope with other continuous conditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Message-passing architectures struggle to sufficiently model long-range
dependencies in node and graph prediction tasks. We propose a novel approach
exploiting hierarchical graph structures and adaptive random walks to address
this challenge. Our method introduces learnable transition probabilities that
decide whether the walk should prefer the original graph or travel across
hierarchical shortcuts. On a synthetic long-range task, we demonstrate that our
approach can exceed the theoretical bound that constrains traditional
approaches operating solely on the original topology. Specifically, walks that
prefer the hierarchy achieve the same performance as longer walks on the
original graph. These preliminary findings open a promising direction for
efficiently processing large graphs while effectively capturing long-range
dependencies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE等离散潜在空间深度生成模型具有优秀的数据生成能力，但由于潜在空间过大，其概率推理被认为不可处理

Method: 通过选择高概率潜在变量子集将VQ-VAE蒸馏为概率电路模型，特别适用于VQ-VAE未充分利用潜在空间的情况

Result: 在密度估计和条件生成任务中表现出竞争力，挑战了VQ-VAE作为固有不可处理模型的观念

Conclusion: VQ-VAE可以通过简单策略蒸馏为可处理模型，同时保持表达能力和提供可处理概率推理

Abstract: Deep generative models with discrete latent space, such as the
Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), offer excellent data
generation capabilities, but, due to the large size of their latent space,
their probabilistic inference is deemed intractable. We demonstrate that the
VQ-VAE can be distilled into a tractable model by selecting a subset of latent
variables with high probabilities. This simple strategy is particularly
efficient, especially if the VQ-VAE underutilizes its latent space, which is,
indeed, very often the case. We frame the distilled model as a probabilistic
circuit, and show that it preserves expressiveness of the VQ-VAE while
providing tractable probabilistic inference. Experiments illustrate competitive
performance in density estimation and conditional generation tasks, challenging
the view of the VQ-VAE as an inherently intractable model.

*Matteo Ballegeer,Matthias Bogaert,Dries F. Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了基于实例的成本敏感分类器在信贷评分中对模型解释稳定性的影响，发现虽然成本效率提升，但解释稳定性显著下降，尤其在类不平衡情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然实例依赖成本敏感分类器在提高信贷评分成本效率方面有潜力，但对模型解释稳定性的影响仍未被探索，而监管部门对可解释性的要求日益增加。

Method: 使用四个公开信贷评分数据集，首先评估IDCS分类器的医疗力和成本效率，提出新的评估指标；然后通过控制重采样研究SHAP和LIME特征重要性排名在不同类不平衡程度下的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示IDCS分类器虽然提高了成本效率，但产生的解释稳定性显著低于传统模型，尤其在类不平衡加剧时。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了在信贷评分中成本优化与可解释性之间的关键承赞。在监管对解释性要求日益严格的背景下，必须解决IDCS分类器的稳定性问题，以确保其成本优势不会因不稳定或不可信的解释而受到影响。

Abstract: Instance-dependent cost-sensitive (IDCS) classifiers offer a promising
approach to improving cost-efficiency in credit scoring by tailoring loss
functions to instance-specific costs. However, the impact of such loss
functions on the stability of model explanations remains unexplored in
literature, despite increasing regulatory demands for transparency. This study
addresses this gap by evaluating the stability of Local Interpretable
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
when applied to IDCS models. Using four publicly available credit scoring
datasets, we first assess the discriminatory power and cost-efficiency of IDCS
classifiers, introducing a novel metric to enhance cross-dataset comparability.
We then investigate the stability of SHAP and LIME feature importance rankings
under varying degrees of class imbalance through controlled resampling. Our
results reveal that while IDCS classifiers improve cost-efficiency, they
produce significantly less stable explanations compared to traditional models,
particularly as class imbalance increases, highlighting a critical trade-off
between cost optimization and interpretability in credit scoring. Amid
increasing regulatory scrutiny on explainability, this research underscores the
pressing need to address stability issues in IDCS classifiers to ensure that
their cost advantages are not undermined by unstable or untrustworthy
explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MD-PNOP框架通过将参数偏差残差重构为额外源项，利用训练好的神经算子离线优化解，显著加速参数化PDE求解器，同时严格保持物理约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器在参数化研究和设计优化中存在计算开销大的瓶颈问题，需要一种既能加速求解又能保持物理约束的新方法。

Method: 将参数偏差残差作为额外源项，利用任意训练好的神经算子进行离线解优化，然后将神经算子预测嵌入迭代PDE求解器作为改进的初始猜测。

Result: 在单组参数上训练的神经算子成功加速了异质、正弦和不连续参数分布的求解，计算时间减少约50%，同时保持全阶保真度。

Conclusion: MD-PNOP框架有效解决了神经算子的外推限制，实现了无需重新训练的广泛参数配置泛化，为参数化PDE求解提供了高效且物理可靠的加速方案。

Abstract: The computational overhead of traditional numerical solvers for partial
differential equations (PDEs) remains a critical bottleneck for large-scale
parametric studies and design optimization. We introduce a Minimal-Data
Parametric Neural Operator Preconditioning (MD-PNOP) framework, which
establishes a new paradigm for accelerating parametric PDE solvers while
strictly preserving physical constraints. The key idea is to recast the
residual from parameter deviation as additional source term, where any trained
neural operator can be used to refine the solution in an offline fashion. This
directly addresses the fundamental extrapolation limitation of neural
operators, enabling extrapolative generalization of any neural operator trained
at a single parameter setting across a wide range of configurations without any
retraining. The neural operator predictions are then embedded into iterative
PDE solvers as improved initial guesses, thereby reducing convergence
iterations without sacrificing accuracy. Unlike purely data-driven approaches,
MD-PNOP guarantees that the governing equations remain fully enforced,
eliminating concerns about loss of physics or interpretability. The framework
is architecture-agnostic and is demonstrated using both Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) for Boltzmann transport equation
solvers in neutron transport applications. We demonstrated that neural
operators trained on a single set of constant parameters successfully
accelerate solutions with heterogeneous, sinusoidal, and discontinuous
parameter distributions. Besides, MD-PNOP consistently achieves ~50% reduction
in computational time while maintaining full order fidelity for fixed-source,
single-group eigenvalue, and multigroup coupled eigenvalue problems.

Motivation: 传统强化学习中奖励最大化、安全探索和内在动机通常被作为独立目标研究，缺乏统一的理论框架来整合这些不同目标。

Method: 构建几何框架，将各种目标视为可实现的长期行为空间上的优化问题，将经典方法如策略镜像下降、自然策略梯度和信任域算法推广到非线性效用和凸约束情形。

Conclusion: 提出了一个统一的几何视角来整合强化学习中的多种目标，并指出了几何方法与深度强化学习交叉领域的研究挑战。

Abstract: Reward maximization, safe exploration, and intrinsic motivation are often
studied as separate objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). We present a
unified geometric framework, that views these goals as instances of a single
optimization problem on the space of achievable long-term behavior in an
environment. Within this framework, classical methods such as policy mirror
descent, natural policy gradient, and trust-region algorithms naturally
generalize to nonlinear utilities and convex constraints. We illustrate how
this perspective captures robustness, safety, exploration, and diversity
objectives, and outline open challenges at the interface of geometry and deep
RL.

to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For
researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization
research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动描述方法需要高级别标签数据，但现有数据集缺乏这种注释和低级别描述，导致模型性能受限。

Method: 两步分层次方法：1）使用大语言模型生成详细的低级别描述注释；2）通过检索机制将详细描述与外部文本源中的高级别描述对齐，结合运动特征生成精确的高级别描述。

Result: 在HumanML3D、KIT和BOTH57M三个数据集上，方法在BLEU-1、BLEU-4、CIDEr和ROUGE-L指标上比最优方法M2T-Interpretable提高6%-50%的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够利用外部文本知识来大幅提升运动描述的准确性，尤其是对于现有数据集未覆盖的运动。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance existing motion captioning
methods, which directly map representations of movement to high-level
descriptive captions (e.g., ``a person doing jumping jacks"). The existing
methods require motion data annotated with high-level descriptions (e.g.,
``jumping jacks"). However, such data is rarely available in existing
motion-text datasets, which additionally do not include low-level motion
descriptions. To address this, we propose a two-step hierarchical approach.
First, we employ large language models to create detailed descriptions
corresponding to each high-level caption that appears in the motion-text
datasets (e.g., ``jumping while synchronizing arm extensions with the opening
and closing of legs" for ``jumping jacks"). These refined annotations are used
to retrain motion-to-text models to produce captions with low-level details.
Second, we introduce a pioneering retrieval-based mechanism. It aligns the
detailed low-level captions with candidate high-level captions from additional
text data sources, and combine them with motion features to fabricate precise
high-level captions. Our methodology is distinctive in its ability to harness
knowledge from external text sources to greatly increase motion captioning
accuracy, especially for movements not covered in existing motion-text
datasets. Experiments on three distinct motion-text datasets (HumanML3D, KIT,
and BOTH57M) demonstrate that our method achieves an improvement in average
performance (across BLEU-1, BLEU-4, CIDEr, and ROUGE-L) ranging from 6% to 50%
compared to the state-of-the-art M2T-Interpretable.

TL;DR: PAFlow是一个基于结构药物设计的新模型，通过先验交互指导和可学习原子数预测器，解决了现有方法中概率动态不稳定和分子大小与蛋白质口袋不匹配的问题，在结合亲和力和分子性质方面达到了新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于结构的药物设计生成模型存在概率动态不稳定、生成分子大小与蛋白质口袋几何不匹配的问题，导致质量不一致和脱靶效应，需要开发更稳定和精确的生成方法。

Method: 采用高效的流匹配框架建模生成过程，构建离散原子类型的条件流匹配形式，整合蛋白质-配体交互预测器指导向量场向高亲和力区域生成，并设计基于蛋白质口袋信息的原子数预测器来对齐分子大小。

Result: 在CrossDocked2020基准测试中，PAFlow实现了-8.31的平均Vina评分（结合亲和力），同时保持了良好的分子性质，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PAFlow通过创新的先验交互指导和原子数预测机制，成功解决了SBDD中的关键挑战，为基于结构的药物设计提供了更可靠和高效的生成解决方案。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD), aiming to generate 3D molecules with high
binding affinity toward target proteins, is a vital approach in novel drug
discovery. Although recent generative models have shown great potential, they
suffer from unstable probability dynamics and mismatch between generated
molecule size and the protein pockets geometry, resulting in inconsistent
quality and off-target effects. We propose PAFlow, a novel target-aware
molecular generation model featuring prior interaction guidance and a learnable
atom number predictor. PAFlow adopts the efficient flow matching framework to
model the generation process and constructs a new form of conditional flow
matching for discrete atom types. A protein-ligand interaction predictor is
incorporated to guide the vector field toward higher-affinity regions during
generation, while an atom number predictor based on protein pocket information
is designed to better align generated molecule size with target geometry.
Extensive experiments on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark show that PAFlow
achieves a new state-of-the-art in binding affinity (up to -8.31 Avg. Vina
Score), simultaneously maintains favorable molecular properties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于伪重放的半监督持续学习框架，用于解决心电图信号检测中的类别不平衡和数据存储问题，通过无监督GAN检测新异常模式，并使用生成器合成伪数据来保持对历史模式的学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图自动分析在临床实践中很重要，但面临类别不平衡问题和历史数据存储负担。需要一种既能检测新异常模式又能保持对现有模式识别能力的方法。

Method: 采用伪重放半监督持续学习框架，包含无监督识别和重放检测两个组件。使用GAN进行无监督新模式检测，通过生成器学习每个任务的数据分布并合成伪数据来避免存储所有历史数据。

Result: 在四个公开ECG数据集上的实验验证了该框架的有效性，能够很好地识别新异常模式，同时保持对现有ECG信号的检测性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在解决ECG异常检测中的类别不平衡和数据存储问题方面表现出色，为临床心电图分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely
applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of
the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical
outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals,
the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In
addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all
historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to
recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore,
to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage
limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual
learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised
identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an
unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated
to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical
data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a
generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new
task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous
learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the
newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised
classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show
that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies
while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Microbiomes not only underpin Earth's biogeochemical cycles but also play
crucial roles in both engineered and natural ecosystems, such as the soil,
wastewater treatment, and the human gut. However, microbiome engineering faces
significant obstacles to surmount to deliver the desired improvements in
microbiome control. Here, we use the backpropagation neural network (BPNN),
optimized through differential evolution (DE-BP), to predict the microbial
composition of activated sludge (AS) systems collected from wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs) located worldwide. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
clustering algorithm termed Directional Position Nonlinear Emotional Preference
Migration Behavior Clustering (DPNG-EPMC). This method is applied to conduct a
clustering analysis of WWTPs across various feature attributes. Finally, we
employ the Similar Time Generative Adversarial Networks (SiTime-GAN), to
synthesize novel microbial compositions and feature attributes data. As a
result, we demonstrate that the DE-BP model can provide superior predictions of
the microbial composition. Additionally, we show that the DPNG-EPMC can be
applied to the analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the SiTime-GAN model can generate valuable incremental
synthetic data. Our results, obtained through predicting the microbial
community and conducting analysis of WWTPs under various feature attributes,
develop an understanding of the factors influencing AS communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法通常冻结主干网络并微调少量参数来缓解遗忘，但仍依赖迭代误差反向传播和基于梯度的优化，计算密集且不适合资源受限环境。

Method: FoRo包含轻量级提示调优策略和新型知识编码机制：1）在输入层插入提示嵌入，使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略优化；2）通过非线性随机投影和递归最小二乘法将任务特定知识编码到知识编码矩阵中，实现无需回顾先前数据的分类器增量更新。

Result: 实验表明FoRo显著降低平均遗忘率并提高准确性。由于仅使用前向传播，FoRo减少了内存使用和运行时间，同时在长任务序列中保持高知识保留率。

Conclusion: FoRo为探索预训练模型的持续学习提供了一个有前景的方向，特别是在效率和有效性都至关重要的现实多媒体应用中。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Motivation: 质疑GCL是否真的优于未经训练的基线方法，探究GCL在不同数据集规模和任务难度下的实际表现

Method: 在标准数据集、大型分子数据集(ogbg-molhiv)和合成数据集上，比较GCL与未经训练的GNN、多层感知机和手工统计特征的性能表现

Result: 在标准数据集上GCL优势不明显；在大型分子数据集上，GCL在小规模时落后但在超过数千个图后开始领先，但增益最终会达到平台期；在合成数据集上，GCL准确率随图数量对数增长，性能差距随任务复杂度变化

Conclusion: 需要重视数据集规模在基准测试和应用中的作用，并设计能够避免性能平台期的GCL算法

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a leading paradigm for self-
supervised learning on graphs, with strong performance reported on standardized
datasets and growing applications ranging from genomics to drug discovery. We
ask a basic question: does GCL actually outperform untrained baselines? We find
that GCL's advantage depends strongly on dataset size and task difficulty. On
standard datasets, untrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), simple multilayer
perceptrons, and even handcrafted statistics can rival or exceed GCL. On the
large molecular dataset ogbg-molhiv, we observe a crossover: GCL lags at small
scales but pulls ahead beyond a few thousand graphs, though this gain
eventually plateaus. On synthetic datasets, GCL accuracy approximately scales
with the logarithm of the number of graphs and its performance gap (compared
with untrained GNNs) varies with respect to task complexity. Moving forward, it
is crucial to identify the role of dataset size in benchmarks and applications,
as well as to design GCL algorithms that avoid performance plateaus.

Conclusion: Feynman-Kac引导的CFM为精确控制生成样本提供了有效方法，在化学计算等需要精确约束的领域具有重要应用价值，解决了先前未解决的过渡态手性正确性生成挑战。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching(CFM) represents a fast and high-quality approach to
generative modelling, but in many applications it is of interest to steer the
generated samples towards precise requirements. While steering approaches like
gradient-based guidance, sequential Monte Carlo steering or Feynman-Kac
steering are well established for diffusion models, they have not been extended
to flow matching approaches yet. In this work, we formulate this requirement as
tilting the output with an energy potential. We derive, for the first time,
Feynman-Kac steering for CFM. We evaluate our approach on a set of synthetic
tasks, including the generation of tilted distributions in a high-dimensional
space, which is a particularly challenging case for steering approaches. We
then demonstrate the impact of Feynman-Kac steered CFM on the previously
unsolved challenge of generated transition states of chemical reactions with
the correct chirality, where the reactants or products can have a different
handedness, leading to geometric constraints of the viable reaction pathways
connecting reactants and products. Code to reproduce this study is avaiable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着越来越多的微调模型公开可用，模型合并的安全性受到关注。未经授权的合并可能侵犯开发者权益并泄露敏感个人信息。现有方法主要检测合并模型是否源自特定源模型，但无法有效防止非法合并。

Method: 利用Transformer模型中注意力机制的固有对称性，随机采样两对可逆矩阵并应用于Query-Key和Value-Output分支，这种变换保持模型输出不变的同时将其推离其他微调模型的共享参数空间。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的大量实验表明，MergeLock在大多数情况下可以将涉及受保护模型的合并模型性能降低95%以上。受保护的合并模型无法通过低成本恢复方法有效恢复。

Conclusion: MergeLock提供了一种有效的主动保护机制，直接防止未经授权的模型合并，具有很高的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Model merging leverages multiple finetuned expert models to construct a
multi-task model with low cost, and is gaining increasing attention. However,
as a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns
about the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may
infringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.
Most existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from
a specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In
this paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts
model parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing
unauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of
the attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two
pairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and
Value-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output
unchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other
finetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks
demonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over
95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its
effectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by
MergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,
further enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging. The code is
available at https://github.com/hetailang/Merge-Lock.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于AddIPW估计器的实用方法，用于推荐系统中考虑干扰效应的提升建模，通过梯度优化直接优化经济收益，在模拟中显著优于忽略干扰的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提升建模方法通常忽略干扰效应（一个物品的处理会影响其他物品的结果），这违反了SUTVA假设，导致在真实市场环境中制定次优策略。现有干扰感知估计器尚未应用于提升建模文献，且基于这些估计器的策略优化方法尚未完善。

Method: 使用Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) 估计器作为可微分学习目标，适合基于梯度的优化。将该框架与成熟的响应转换技术结合，直接优化增量利润等经济结果。

Result: 通过模拟实验表明，该方法显著优于忽略干扰的方法，特别是在干扰效应增强时表现更佳。在框架内采用以利润为中心的策略能够识别出最高影响力的干预措施。

Conclusion: 该方法为更有利可图的激励个性化提供了实用路径，能够有效处理推荐系统中的干扰效应，直接优化经济收益目标。

Abstract: Uplift modeling is a key technique for promotion optimization in recommender
systems, but standard methods typically fail to account for interference, where
treating one item affects the outcomes of others. This violation of the Stable
Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) leads to suboptimal policies in
real-world marketplaces. Recent developments in interference-aware estimators
such as Additive Inverse Propensity Weighting (AddIPW) have not found their way
into the uplift modeling literature yet, and optimising policies using these
estimators is not well-established. This paper proposes a practical methodology
to bridge this gap. We use the AddIPW estimator as a differentiable learning
objective suitable for gradient-based optimization. We demonstrate how this
framework can be integrated with proven response transformation techniques to
directly optimize for economic outcomes like incremental profit. Through
simulations, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
interference-naive methods, especially as interference effects grow.
Furthermore, we find that adapting profit-centric uplift strategies within our
framework can yield superior performance in identifying the highest-impact
interventions, offering a practical path toward more profitable incentive
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动和可穿戴传感技术能够连续监测情感和压力状态，但结合生态自我报告问卷时存在数据缺失和不规则时间间隔的挑战，需要有效的时间依赖建模方法。

Method: 提出Ema2Vec时间嵌入方法，专门设计用于处理不规则间隔的自我报告数据，通过时间感知表示来捕捉序列中的时间依赖性。

Result: Ema2Vec在纵向压力预测任务中超越了依赖固定大小日窗口的标准基线方法，以及没有时间感知表示的纵向序列模型。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在处理不规则采样的纵向数据时，纳入时间嵌入表示的重要性，Ema2Vec方法为此类问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile and wearable sensing technologies has
enabled continuous and personalized monitoring of affect, mood disorders, and
stress. When combined with ecological self-report questionnaires, these systems
offer a powerful opportunity to explore longitudinal modeling of human
behaviors. However, challenges arise from missing data and the irregular timing
of self-reports, which make challenging the prediction of human states and
behaviors. In this study, we investigate the use of time embeddings to capture
time dependencies within sequences of Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA).
We introduce a novel time embedding method, Ema2Vec, designed to effectively
handle irregularly spaced self-reports, and evaluate it on a new task of
longitudinal stress prediction. Our method outperforms standard stress
prediction baselines that rely on fixed-size daily windows, as well as models
trained directly on longitudinal sequences without time-aware representations.
These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating time embeddings when
modeling irregularly sampled longitudinal data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出OCFL（一次性聚类联邦学习）算法，自动检测最佳聚类时机，无需调整超参数即可实现个性化模型训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端数据分布异质性问题，传统CFL方法假设和设置与标准FL不同，需要自动化的聚类时机检测方法

Method: 基于客户端梯度余弦距离和温度测量来检测联邦模型收敛时机，使用基于密度的聚类方法区分不同数据分布下的神经网络损失曲面

Result: 在5个基准数据集上测试40多个任务，证明OCFL方法性能良好，密度聚类方法在区分不同分布神经网络方面效率高

Conclusion: OCFL算法能自动检测聚类时机，为个性化联邦学习提供实用解决方案，同时通过GradCAM局部解释性分析揭示了个性化与预测可解释性之间的关系

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of
decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources
without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since
its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal
with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource
allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with
the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to
deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been
published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic
assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this
work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a
clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest
suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine
distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that
detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate
our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over
forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the
good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated
manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the
practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients,
providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering
methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks
trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of
local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more
insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability
of local predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种统一的训练框架，通过熵算驱动课程学习和多任务学习来提高人类移动预测的准确性和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动数据的复杂性导致模型训练困难，而仅预测下一个位置忽略了距离和方向等隐式因素，影响预测效果。

Method: 采用熵算驱动的课程学习策略（基于Lempel-Ziv压缩算法评估轨迹可预测性）和多任务训练（同时优化位置预测、移动距离和方向估计）。

Result: 在HuMob挑战赛中达到最高水平表现：GEO-BLEU指标0.354，DTW指标26.15，收敛速度提升达2.92倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化训练过程和多维度学习，有效提升了人类移动预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable
devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches.
However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training,
leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile,
exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including
distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This
paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven
curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed
entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory
predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from
simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The
multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction
alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning
realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through
complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in
accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with
up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于梯度的因果发现方法容易受到数据分布偏差的影响，本文识别了两种偏差：边际分布不对称性和边际分布偏移不对称性，并通过实验展示了这些偏差如何影响因果学习，同时提出了控制偏差的方法。

Motivation: 梯度因果发现方法虽然高效且可扩展，但对训练数据的分布偏差敏感。本文旨在识别和分析这些分布偏差对因果发现的影响，并提出解决方案。

Method: 在双变量分类设置中使用狄利克雷先验，构建了两个简单模型来学习边际或条件数据分布，通过实验验证偏差的存在和影响，并测试消除因果分解竞争的方法。

Result: 实验证明梯度因果发现方法确实容易受到边际分布不对称性和边际分布偏移不对称性的影响，但通过消除因果分解之间的竞争可以使模型对这些偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分布偏差是梯度因果发现方法的重要挑战，但通过适当的模型设计（如消除因果分解竞争）可以有效控制这些偏差，提高因果发现的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Gradient-based causal discovery shows great potential for deducing causal
structure from data in an efficient and scalable way. Those approaches however
can be susceptible to distributional biases in the data they are trained on. We
identify two such biases: Marginal Distribution Asymmetry, where differences in
entropy skew causal learning toward certain factorizations, and Marginal
Distribution Shift Asymmetry, where repeated interventions cause faster shifts
in some variables than in others. For the bivariate categorical setup with
Dirichlet priors, we illustrate how these biases can occur even in controlled
synthetic data. To examine their impact on gradient-based methods, we employ
two simple models that derive causal factorizations by learning marginal or
conditional data distributions - a common strategy in gradient-based causal
discovery. We demonstrate how these models can be susceptible to both biases.
We additionally show how the biases can be controlled. An empirical evaluation
of two related, existing approaches indicates that eliminating competition
between possible causal factorizations can make models robust to the presented
biases.

TL;DR: L2C是一个通过元学习来自动调整ADMM-DDP算法超参数的框架，使用轻量级神经网络建模超参数，能够适应不同任务和智能体配置，在分布式轨迹优化中实现高效协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分布式轨迹优化方法ADMM-DDP需要大量人工调参来平衡局部任务性能和全局协调，这个过程既耗时又困难，因此需要一种自动化的超参数优化方法。

Method: 提出L2C框架，通过端到端微分ADMM-DDP流程，使用轻量级神经网络元学习超参数。利用DDP组件（如Riccati递归和反馈增益）高效计算元梯度，通过辅助ADMM框架协调分布式矩阵值LQR问题。

Result: 在合作空中运输任务中，L2C能够在高保真仿真中生成动态可行轨迹，重新配置四旋翼编队进行安全6自由度负载操作，适应不同团队规模和任务条件，梯度计算速度比现有方法快88%。

Conclusion: L2C提供了一个通用的元学习框架，能够自动适应分布式轨迹优化中的超参数调优，显著提高了多智能体系统的协调效率和性能，具有强大的适应性和计算效率。

Abstract: Distributed trajectory optimization via ADMM-DDP is a powerful approach for
coordinating multi-agent systems, but it requires extensive tuning of tightly
coupled hyperparameters that jointly govern local task performance and global
coordination. In this paper, we propose Learning to Coordinate (L2C), a general
framework that meta-learns these hyperparameters, modeled by lightweight
agent-wise neural networks, to adapt across diverse tasks and agent
configurations. L2C differentiates end-to-end through the ADMM-DDP pipeline in
a distributed manner. It also enables efficient meta-gradient computation by
reusing DDP components such as Riccati recursions and feedback gains. These
gradients correspond to the optimal solutions of distributed matrix-valued LQR
problems, coordinated across agents via an auxiliary ADMM framework that
becomes convex under mild assumptions. Training is further accelerated by
truncating iterations and meta-learning ADMM penalty parameters optimized for
rapid residual reduction, with provable Lipschitz-bounded gradient errors. On a
challenging cooperative aerial transport task, L2C generates dynamically
feasible trajectories in high-fidelity simulation using IsaacSIM, reconfigures
quadrotor formations for safe 6-DoF load manipulation in tight spaces, and
adapts robustly to varying team sizes and task conditions, while achieving up
to $88\%$ faster gradient computation than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文建立了相对轨迹平衡(RTB)与KL正则化强化学习方法Trust-PCL之间的等价关系，将RTB置于KL正则化RL的理论框架中，并展示了KL正则化RL方法在微调任务中能达到与RTB相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模领域最近强调了强化学习在微调中的重要性，特别是KL正则化方法对自回归和扩散模型非常有效。相对轨迹平衡(RTB)作为GFlowNets中的目标函数被提出用于改进序列生成模型的微调，但需要明确其在更广泛RL理论框架中的位置。

Method: 基于先前连接GFlowNets和最大熵RL的工作，本文建立了RTB与off-policy RL方法Trust-PCL之间的等价关系，并通过重新分析RTB论文中的示例来验证KL正则化RL方法的性能。

Result: 研究发现RTB与Trust-PCL在理论上等价，将RTB置于KL正则化RL的广泛理论框架中。实验表明KL正则化RL方法能够达到与RTB相当的性能表现。

Conclusion: 本文通过建立RTB与KL正则化RL方法的等价关系，为理解RTB提供了新的理论视角，表明KL正则化RL方法可以作为RTB的有效替代方案，为序列生成模型的微调提供了更多选择。

Abstract: Recent progress in generative modeling has highlighted the importance of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for fine-tuning, with KL-regularized methods in
particular proving to be highly effective for both autoregressive and diffusion
models. Complementing this line of work, the Relative Trajectory Balance (RTB)
objective was recently introduced in the context of Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to serve the same role of improving fine-tuning in sequential
generative models. Building on prior work linking GFlowNets and maximum-entropy
RL, we establish in this paper an equivalence between RTB and Trust-PCL, an
off-policy RL method with KL regularization. This equivalence situates RTB
within the broader theoretical landscape of KL-regularized RL, and clarifies
its relationship to earlier methods. Leveraging this insight, we revisit an
illustrative example from the RTB paper and show that KL-regularized RL methods
achieve comparable performance, offering an alternative perspective to what was
previously reported.

Conclusion: 通过RL训练小模型可以超越静态大模型，为代理学习提供了新方向

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting
powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more
experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that
improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much
larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this
setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing
code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient
updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration
actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed
asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second,
using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A
program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely.
To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial
credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early
(e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static
language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the
agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as
reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that
performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with
RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent
scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Result: 多模态方法 consistently 优于单模态基线，不同模态和模型架构在不同应用子集上表现各异。模型在一个领域训练后迁移到新应用时性能下降，表明跨域泛化仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更具泛化能力的认知负荷检测系统提供了可靠基线和实用见解，推动了人机交互和自适应系统领域的研究和实践应用。

Abstract: Task load detection is essential for optimizing human performance across
diverse applications, yet current models often lack generalizability beyond
narrow experimental domains. While prior research has focused on individual
tasks and limited modalities, there remains a gap in evaluating model
robustness and transferability in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a new multimodal dataset that extends
established cognitive load detection benchmarks with a real-world gaming
application, using the $n$-back test as a scientific foundation. Task load
annotations are derived from objective performance, subjective NASA-TLX
ratings, and task-level design, enabling a comprehensive evaluation framework.
State-of-the-art end-to-end model, including xLSTM, ConvNeXt, and Transformer
architectures are systematically trained and evaluated on multiple modalities
and application domains to assess their predictive performance and cross-domain
generalization. Results demonstrate that multimodal approaches consistently
outperform unimodal baselines, with specific modalities and model architectures
showing varying impact depending on the application subset. Importantly, models
trained on one domain exhibit reduced performance when transferred to novel
applications, underscoring remaining challenges for universal cognitive load
estimation. These findings provide robust baselines and actionable insights for
developing more generalizable cognitive load detection systems, advancing both
research and practical implementation in human-computer interaction and
adaptive systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks
such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world
conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often
struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability,
despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely
capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly
simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further
hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI
(STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects
and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of
uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL
environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing
approaches.

Motivation: 蒸馏在大型语言模型预训练中重新受到关注（如Llama-3.2和Gemma模型系列），但其对现代LLM关键能力（如测试时扩展和上下文学习）的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究蒸馏预训练对模型性能的影响，使用二元模型沙箱进行机制分析，以隔离观察现象背后的共同主要因素。

Result: 1) 蒸馏预训练显著改善测试时扩展性能；2) 但会损害上下文学习能力，特别是通过归纳头建模的能力；3) 通过沙箱分析揭示了这些现象的共同机制。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了蒸馏预训练的性能权衡，并提供了对预训练设计选择的见解，有助于实践者做出更明智的决策。

Abstract: In the past year, distillation has seen a renewed prominence in large
language model (LLM) pretraining, exemplified by the Llama-3.2 and Gemma model
families. While distillation has historically been shown to improve statistical
modeling, its effects on new paradigms that are key to modern LLMs, such as
test-time scaling and in-context learning, remain underexplored. In this work,
we make three main contributions. First, we show that pretraining with
distillation yields models that exhibit remarkably better test-time scaling.
Second, we observe that this benefit comes with a trade-off: distillation
impairs in-context learning capabilities, particularly the one modeled via
induction heads. Third, to demystify these findings, we study distilled
pretraining in a sandbox of a bigram model, which helps us isolate the common
principal factor behind our observations. Finally, using these insights, we
shed light on various design choices for pretraining that should help
practitioners going forward.

Motivation: COVID-19大流行对心血管疾病患者的护理造成了严重干扰，影响了关键生物标志物。现有方法未能同时处理多目标预测、生物标志物相互依赖性、时间模式和预测不确定性。

Method: 使用预训练的BERT-based transformer框架，结合贝叶斯变分推理估计不确定性，嵌入机制捕获时间关系，DeepMTR模型捕获生物标志物相互关系。

Result: 在3,390份患者记录上评估，MBT-CB在MAE、RMSE和MSE指标上均优于其他基线模型，有效捕获了数据不确定性、模型不确定性和时间动态。

Conclusion: MBT-CB的优越性能表明其在改善心血管疾病生物标志物预测和支持临床决策方面具有巨大潜力，特别是在大流行等危机时期。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide,
disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as
cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and
behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of
these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding
preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction
of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning
(ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns,
and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target
Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to
jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The
model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties,
embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture
biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data
from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts
during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of
baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887,
RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model
uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via
its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance
highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support
clinical decision-making during pandemics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DeepONet中"香草"版本和修改版本的冲突：前者简单高效但准确性低，后者准确性高但训练时间长。需要一种方法能同时保持高效率和高准确性。

Method: 受Transformer启发，在DeepONet的分支网络和干网络之间引入双向交叉条件化机制：将查询点信息注入分支网络，将输入函数信息注入干网络，实现动态依赖关系。

Result: 在4个PDE标准测试中（平流、扩散-反应、Burgers、KdV方程），每个情况都有一个变体能够达到或超越修改DeepONet的准确性，同时提高训练效率。最佳变体与方程的本质特性相符。

Conclusion: 交叉条件化的有效性依赖于偏微分方程的特性和物理机制。通过严格的统计分析（Wilcoxon、Glass's Delta、Spearman相关系数）验证了方法的稳健性。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising tool for accelerating the
solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). The Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets) represent a pioneering framework in this area: the "vanilla"
DeepONet is valued for its simplicity and efficiency, while the modified
DeepONet achieves higher accuracy at the cost of increased training time. In
this work, we propose a series of Transformer-inspired DeepONet variants that
introduce bidirectional cross-conditioning between the branch and trunk
networks in DeepONet. Query-point information is injected into the branch
network and input-function information into the trunk network, enabling dynamic
dependencies while preserving the simplicity and efficiency of the "vanilla"
DeepONet in a non-intrusive manner. Experiments on four PDE benchmarks --
advection, diffusion-reaction, Burgers', and Korteweg-de Vries equations --
show that for each case, there exists a variant that matches or surpasses the
accuracy of the modified DeepONet while offering improved training efficiency.
Moreover, the best-performing variant for each equation aligns naturally with
the equation's underlying characteristics, suggesting that the effectiveness of
cross-conditioning depends on the characteristics of the equation and its
underlying physics. To ensure robustness, we validate the effectiveness of our
variants through a range of rigorous statistical analyses, among them the
Wilcoxon Two One-Sided Test, Glass's Delta, and Spearman's rank correlation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing
interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their
ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world
application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first
step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work,
we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as
time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical
relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33
real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of
challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with
threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and
multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be
dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task
types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt
task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure
meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight
state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals
limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis
workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for
domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to
changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing
vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple
origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic
graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big
maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination
pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to
select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete
action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind
resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System
(AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We
evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with
recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our
experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in
policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive
shaping rewards produces additional gains.

TL;DR: 提出基于异常检测的多模态架构，使用IMU和麦克风传感器实时检测车辆磨损和损坏，相比传统方法在性能和实时性上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车队和共享车辆系统中的磨损检测是重要挑战，现有手动检测方法劳动密集且易出错，图像方法在实时性和底部损坏检测方面存在局限。

Method: 开发多模态自编码器架构，将IMU和麦克风传感器集成到挡风玻璃安装的紧凑设备中，实现实时损坏检测。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到汽车安全（如安全气囊系统集成）和自动驾驶车辆碰撞检测等应用，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Wear and tear detection in fleet and shared vehicle systems is a critical
challenge, particularly in rental and car-sharing services, where minor damage,
such as dents, scratches, and underbody impacts, often goes unnoticed or is
detected too late. Currently, manual inspection methods are the default
approach but are labour intensive and prone to human error. In contrast,
state-of-the-art image-based methods struggle with real-time performance and
are less effective at detecting underbody damage due to limited visual access
and poor spatial coverage. This work introduces a novel multi-modal
architecture based on anomaly detection to address these issues. Sensors such
as IMUs and microphones are integrated into a compact device mounted on the
vehicle's windshield. This approach supports real-time damage detection while
avoiding the need for highly resource-intensive sensors. We developed multiple
variants of multi-modal autoencoder-based architectures and evaluated them
against unimodal and state-of-the-art methods. Our ensemble pooling multi-modal
model achieved the highest performance, with a Receiver Operating
Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) of 92%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in real-world applications. This approach can also be extended to
other applications, such as improving automotive safety - where it can
integrate with airbag systems for efficient deployment - and helping autonomous
vehicles by complementing other sensors in collision detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradES是一种基于梯度的早期停止方法，通过监控Transformer组件中投影矩阵的梯度大小，在梯度低于收敛阈值时单独冻结该矩阵参数，从而加速训练并提高泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的早期停止方法需要监控全局验证损失并同时停止所有参数更新，对于大型Transformer模型来说计算成本高昂，因为验证推理需要大量时间

Method: 在Transformer的注意力投影和前馈层矩阵中跟踪反向传播时的梯度大小，当某个投影矩阵的梯度低于收敛阈值τ时，单独排除该矩阵的进一步更新，允许收敛慢的矩阵继续学习

Result: GradES将训练时间加速1.57-7.22倍，同时通过早期防止过拟合提高泛化能力，平均准确率提高1.2%

Conclusion: 基于组件级别的梯度监控的早期停止方法能够有效加速Transformer模型的训练过程，同时提高模型性能

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter
updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers
due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES,
a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer
components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found
that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES
tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during
training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence
threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates
individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow
converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters
when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by
1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early
prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于基础模型的强化学习在多轮任务中存在稀疏奖励和策略梯度更新的限制，需要防止负面样本对模型性能的损害

Method: 提出SoLS离策略RL算法，对正样本直接更新策略，对负样本采用保守正则化更新，并加入成功转换回放机制

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中显著优于现有方法（相对提升至少17%），计算资源需求大幅减少，推理速度快5-60倍

Conclusion: SoLS通过区分处理正负样本的有效策略，为基于基础模型的RL在UI导航任务中提供了高效且实用的解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using foundation models for policy approximations
in multi-turn tasks remains challenging. We identify two main limitations
related to sparse reward settings and policy gradient updates, based on which
we formulate a key insight: updates from positive samples with high returns
typically do not require policy regularisation, whereas updates from negative
samples, reflecting undesirable behaviour, can harm model performance. This
paper introduces Succeed or Learn Slowly (SoLS), a novel off-policy RL
algorithm evaluated on mobile app control tasks. SoLS improves sample
efficiency when fine-tuning foundation models for user interface navigation via
a modified off-policy actor-critic approach, applying direct policy updates for
positive samples and conservative, regularised updates for negative ones to
prevent model degradation. We augment SoLS with Successful Transition Replay
(STR), which prioritises learning from successful interactions, further
improving sample efficiency. We evaluate SoLS on the AndroidWorld benchmark,
where it significantly outperforms existing methods (at least 17% relative
increase), including prompt-engineering and RL approaches, while requiring
substantially fewer computational resources than GPT-4o-based methods with
5-60x faster inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于权重的模型特征分析技术存在性能下降和数据效率低的问题，需要直接从神经网络权重中推导有意义特征的方法

Method: 设计Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS)激活函数，专门用于Gated Linear Units (GLUs)，实现基于权重的可解释性

Result: SQS在性能上与最先进的激活函数相当，同时实现了基于权重的可解释性

Conclusion: SQS激活函数成功解决了现有技术的缺陷，在保持性能的同时提供了更好的可解释性保证

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for
ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in
mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to
derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would
provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing
techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks
such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce
Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated
Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks.
Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with
state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based
interpretability

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的CMMN扩展方法，通过两种替代方法计算源参考频谱，显著改善了EEG独立成分分类性能，特别是在识别脑源与非脑源成分方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG记录包含丰富的神经活动信息，但受到伪影、噪声以及传感器、放大器和滤波器的表面差异影响。现有的独立成分分析和自动标记方法需要改进以适应不同数据集间的频谱差异。

Method: 提出了CMMN方法的扩展版本，采用两种计算源参考频谱的方法：(1)通道平均和l1归一化重心法；(2)主体到主体映射法，寻找与目标主体频谱最接近的源主体。该方法产生时空可分离滤波器，可用于不同通道数的数据集映射。

Result: 在独立成分分类任务中应用这些滤波器，显示在识别脑源与非脑源成分方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 通过适当的频谱归一化滤波可以最小化记录设备和环境差异对机器学习模型性能的影响，该方法对癫痫和精神疾病等神经病理学的EEG诊断和监测具有临床意义。

Abstract: EEG recordings contain rich information about neural activity but are subject
to artifacts, noise, and superficial differences due to sensors, amplifiers,
and filtering. Independent component analysis and automatic labeling of
independent components (ICs) enable artifact removal in EEG pipelines.
Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN) is a recent tool used to
achieve spectral conformity of EEG signals, which was shown to improve deep
neural network approaches for sleep staging. Here we propose a novel extension
of the CMMN method with two alternative approaches to computing the source
reference spectrum the target signals are mapped to: (1) channel-averaged and
$l_1$-normalized barycenter, and (2) a subject-to-subject mapping that finds
the source subject with the closest spectrum to the target subject. Notably,
our extension yields space-time separable filters that can be used to map
between datasets with different numbers of EEG channels. We apply these filters
in an IC classification task, and show significant improvement in recognizing
brain versus non-brain ICs.
  Clinical relevance - EEG recordings are used in the diagnosis and monitoring
of multiple neuropathologies, including epilepsy and psychosis. While EEG
analysis can benefit from automating artifact removal through independent
component analysis and labeling, differences in recording equipment and context
(the presence of noise from electrical wiring and other devices) may impact the
performance of machine learning models, but these differences can be minimized
by appropriate spectral normalization through filtering.

### [173] [VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection for Adaptive Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01903)
*Tanvir Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VISP是一种基于梯度波动性的自适应正则化方法，通过动态计算梯度统计量来调整随机噪声注入，选择性地正则化高波动性的输入和隐藏节点，从而提升深度神经网络的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法（如均匀噪声或固定dropout率）缺乏对网络内部动态的适应性，无法针对不同节点的波动性差异进行有效正则化。VISP旨在利用梯度波动性信息来实现更智能的自适应正则化。

Method: VISP动态计算梯度统计量来衡量波动性，并以此缩放随机投影矩阵。该方法选择性地对表现出较高梯度波动性的输入和隐藏节点进行正则化，同时保持稳定表示不变。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，VISP相比基线模型和固定噪声方法能持续提升泛化性能。分析显示VISP能稳定网络内部动态并促进更鲁棒的特征表示。

Conclusion: VISP通过利用梯度波动性信息实现自适应正则化，有效缓解过拟合问题，提升深度神经网络的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为智能正则化方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive
regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic
noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that
apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes
volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic
projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden
nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable
representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves
generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.
In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral
properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that
VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters
a more robust feature representation.

Motivation: 传统偏见缓解技术存在"展平效应"，在改善劣势群体结果时会以损害强势群体性能为代价

Method: 提出BM-CL框架，将偏见缓解重新解释为域增量持续学习问题，模型需要适应变化的公平性条件，基于Learning without Forgetting和Elastic Weight Consolidation技术

Result: 在合成和真实图像数据集上识别并缓解多种偏见来源，同时最小化原始知识损失

Conclusion: 该方法培合了公平性和持续学习领域，为开发既公平又高效的机器学习系统提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了NAS的计算成本，自动发现了U-Net架构的优越设计原则，证明了其在复杂多目标优化问题中的实用价值。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the
design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational
budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting
objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity
multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational
cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill
sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for
faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel
continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell
within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search
dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS
algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under
limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow
regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The
proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model
with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good
prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that
the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior
U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing
each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) offers a
privacy-preserving scheme, enabling clients to collaboratively fine-tune
locally deployed LLMs or smaller language models (SLMs) without exchanging raw
data. While parameter-sharing methods in traditional FL models solves number of
technical challenges, they still incur high communication overhead and struggle
with adapting to heterogeneous model architectures. Federated distillation, a
framework for mutual knowledge transfer via shared logits, typically offers
lower communication overhead than parameter-sharing methods. However,
transmitting logits from LLMs remains challenging for bandwidth-limited clients
due to their high dimensionality. In this work, we focus on a federated LLM
distillation with efficient communication overhead. To achieve this, we first
propose an adaptive Top-k logit selection mechanism, dynamically sparsifying
logits according to real-time communication conditions. Then to tackle the
dimensional inconsistency introduced by the adaptive sparsification, we design
an adaptive logits aggregation scheme, effectively alleviating the artificial
and uninformative inputs introduced by conventional zero-padding methods.
Finally, to enhance the distillation effect, we incorporate LoRA-adapted
hidden-layer projection from LLM into the distillation loss, reducing the
communication overhead further while providing richer representation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves superior performance
compared to baseline methods while effectively reducing communication overhead
by approximately 50%.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between
projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and
quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for
scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the
distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the
performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize
spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution
information from serious time slices. However, learning future order
distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem
with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture
this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative
spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and
global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior
performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The
main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global
graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional
long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An
innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph
learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to
extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust
future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure
forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated
in real-world production environments.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了10种深度学习优化器，发现先前声称的1.4-2倍加速实际上在公平调参和完整训练评估下仅为1.1-1.4倍，且加速效果随模型规模增大而减小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决优化器比较中的两个方法缺陷：不平等超参数调优和有限/误导性评估设置，以提供公平的优化器性能比较。

Method: 在0.1B-1.2B参数规模的模型和1-8倍Chinchilla最优数据比例下，对10种优化器进行系统研究，包括严格的超参数调优和完整训练评估。

Result: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon、Soap）确实最快，但加速效果从0.1B模型的1.4倍降至1.2B模型的仅1.1倍；中间检查点比较可能产生误导性结果。

Conclusion: 优化器比较需要严格的超参数调优和完整训练评估；矩阵预条件优化器虽有优势但加速效果随模型规模增大而显著降低，AdamW在大模型中仍具竞争力。

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining,
despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We
posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and
hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited
or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a
systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales
(0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum).
We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter
tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios,
performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one
optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer
unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned
baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for
1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before
reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two
optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our
thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon
and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with
matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based
optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over
AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双层优化框架，通过几何曲率分析实现隐私保护与数据效用的协同平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习需要数据集进行训练，但直接共享原始数据存在成员推理攻击等隐私风险。现有隐私保护技术往往会降低数据准确性、特异性和多样性，影响下游任务性能，因此需要在隐私保护和数据效用之间找到最优平衡

Method: 采用双层优化框架：上层任务关注数据效用，使用判别器指导生成过程确保扰动后的潜在变量映射到高质量样本；下层任务关注数据隐私，利用数据流形上的局部外在曲率作为个体对MIA脆弱性的量化度量，通过向低曲率区域扰动样本来抑制易受攻击的独特特征组合

Result: 广泛的实验评估表明，该方法不仅增强了下游任务对MIA的抵抗能力，而且在样本质量和多样性方面超越了现有方法

Conclusion: 通过交替优化两个目标，实现了隐私和效用的协同平衡，为解决隐私保护与数据效用之间的关键挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly
sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference
attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data
perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly
utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and
diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data
utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation
and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework
for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on
data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the
upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that
perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining
fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs
local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of
individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted
privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our
method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are
vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we
achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances
resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in
terms of sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the
absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical
structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single

this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset

nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level
representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust

HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct
structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a

TL;DR: 提出E-ICL+FCP框架，通过基于Transformer的ICL模型模拟FCP的多重重训练过程，在保持覆盖保证的同时显著提高数据效率和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Conformal Prediction方法的数据效率低和计算复杂度高的问题，Split CP数据利用率低，Full CP计算开销过大

Method: 使用排列不变的Transformer-based ICL模型，采用CP感知的损失函数进行训练，模拟FCP的多重重训练过程而不需要实际重训练

Result: 在合成和真实任务上实验表明，E-ICL+FCP相比现有SCP和FCP基线方法获得了更优的效率-覆盖率权衡

Conclusion: E-ICL+FCP框架有效解决了传统CP方法的局限性，在保持统计覆盖保证的同时显著提升了数据效率和计算效率

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical for trustworthy AI. Conformal
Prediction (CP) provides prediction sets with distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but its two main variants face complementary limitations. Split CP
(SCP) suffers from data inefficiency due to dataset partitioning, while full CP
(FCP) improves data efficiency at the cost of prohibitive retraining
complexity. Recent approaches based on meta-learning or in-context learning
(ICL) partially mitigate these drawbacks. However, they rely on training
procedures not specifically tailored to CP, which may yield large prediction
sets. We introduce an efficient FCP framework, termed enhanced ICL-based FCP
(E-ICL+FCP), which employs a permutation-invariant Transformer-based ICL model
trained with a CP-aware loss. By simulating the multiple retrained models
required by FCP without actual retraining, E-ICL+FCP preserves coverage while
markedly reducing both inefficiency and computational overhead. Experiments on
synthetic and real tasks demonstrate that E-ICL+FCP attains superior
efficiency-coverage trade-offs compared to existing SCP and FCP baselines.

TL;DR: Conditional-$t^3$VAE通过为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，解决了传统VAE在类别不平衡数据集上潜在空间分配不均的问题，显著提高了生成公平性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE和$t^3$VAE在类别不平衡数据集上，潜在空间分配与训练集类别频率成正比，导致尾部类别表示不足，生成公平性降低。

Method: 提出Conditional-$t^3$VAE，为每个类别定义Student's t联合先验分布，防止多数类别主导；使用γ-power散度推导的闭式目标进行优化；推导等权重潜在混合Student's t分布用于类别平衡生成。

Result: 在SVHN-LT、CIFAR100-LT和CelebA数据集上，Conditional-$t^3$VAE始终获得比$t^3$VAE和高斯VAE基线更低的FID分数，特别是在严重类别不平衡情况下；在每类F1评估中也优于条件高斯VAE。

Conclusion: 在轻度不平衡情况下（ρ≲3），高斯模型仍具竞争力，但在更极端的不平衡情况下，Conditional-$t^3$VAE显著提高了生成公平性和多样性。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种动态验证框架，通过惩惨惨人模拟器和临床评分标准生成器，训练出了Baichuan-M2医疗增强推理模型，在HealthBench评测中超过大部分开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型在静态测试中表现优异，但在真实临床决策中存在差距，需要动态交互性验证框架来对准实际应用需求。

Method: 构建动态验证框架，包含惩惨惨人模拟器（使用去识别医疗记录）和临床评分标准生成器，通过多阶段强化学习策略和改进的GRPO算法训练32B参数的Baichuan-M2模型。

Result: Baichuan-M2在HealthBench评测中超过所有其他开源模型和大部分先进闭源模型，在HealthBench Hard标准上获得超过32分的成绩，仅次于GPT-5。

Conclusion: 稳健的动态验证系统对将大语言模型能力与实际临床应用对齐至关重要，为医疗AI部署建立了新的性能-参数对偿前沿。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning
capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical
research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of
medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world
clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams
fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework
that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale,
high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework
comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic
clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical
Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation
metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter
medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement
learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other
open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a
score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously
exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier
system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical
applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter
trade-off for medical AI deployment.

TL;DR: ST-Hyper是一个用于多元时间序列预测的深度学习模型，通过自适应超图建模来捕捉多尺度时空依赖关系，在长短期预测任务上均取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多元时间序列预测方法难以有效建模跨多个时空尺度的依赖关系，需要一种能够同时考虑空间和时间范围的高阶依赖建模方法。

Method: 提出了ST-Hyper模型，包含时空金字塔建模(STPM)模块提取多尺度特征，自适应超图建模(AHM)模块学习稀疏超图来捕捉鲁棒的高阶依赖，并通过三相超图传播进行特征交互。

Result: 在6个真实世界多元时间序列数据集上的实验表明，ST-Hyper在长期和短期预测任务上分别实现了平均3.8%和6.8%的MAE降低，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ST-Hyper通过超图建模有效捕捉了多元时间序列中的多尺度时空动态依赖关系，为复杂时空依赖建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based
methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial
(inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods
may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales
(ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In
this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across
multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we
introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features
at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph
Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust
high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these
features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively
capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six
real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of
3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Motivation: 结合固定路线公交的成本效益和需求响应式运输的适应性，解决低密度区域公共交通可达性问题，改善第一英里/最后一英里连接。

Method: 使用深度强化学习（PPO算法）动态分配车辆到细分区域，响应实时需求波动。基于代理的仿真在慕尼黑真实公交线路上验证。

Result: RL模型训练后，半按需服务比传统固定路线服务多服务16%乘客，成本高13%。RL控制带来2.4%额外乘客和1.4%额外成本。

Conclusion: 展示了SAV接驳车和机器学习技术在公共交通中的整合潜力，为多模式交通系统中解决第一英里/最后一英里问题奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper develops a semi-on-demand transit feeder service using shared
autonomous vehicles (SAVs) and zonal dispatching control based on reinforcement
learning (RL). This service combines the cost-effectiveness of fixed-route
transit with the adaptability of demand-responsive transport to improve
accessibility in lower-density areas. Departing from the terminus, SAVs first
make scheduled fixed stops, then offer on-demand pick-ups and drop-offs in a
pre-determined flexible-route area. Our deep RL model dynamically assigns
vehicles to subdivided flexible-route zones in response to real-time demand
fluctuations and operations, using a policy gradient algorithm - Proximal
Policy Optimization. The methodology is demonstrated through agent-based
simulations on a real-world bus route in Munich, Germany. Results show that
after efficient training of the RL model, the semi-on-demand service with
dynamic zonal control serves 16% more passengers at 13% higher generalized
costs on average compared to traditional fixed-route service. The efficiency
gain brought by RL control brings 2.4% more passengers at 1.4% higher costs.
This study not only showcases the potential of integrating SAV feeders and
machine learning techniques into public transit, but also sets the groundwork
for further innovations in addressing first-mile-last-mile problems in
multimodal transit systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法计算时间过长且需要算法设计领域知识，不适合时间敏感的灾害场景，急需快速高效的灾后道路评估解决方案。

Method: 使用深度强化学习，开发网络转换方法将基于链路的路径问题转化为等效节点形式，采用合成道路网络生成技术解决大规模训练数据稀缺问题，使用POMO策略优化进行多任务学习。

Result: 模型在解决方案质量上优于商业求解器16-69%，推理时间仅需1-2秒（传统方法需要100-2000秒），在不同问题规模、无人机数量和时间约束下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了计算效率和解决方案质量，特别适用于时间关键的灾害响应应用，为快速决策拯救生命提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective
emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive
computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making
them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an
attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for real-time drone routing
decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep
reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes
without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method
is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based
formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the
scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy
optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities
to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two
key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 16--69\% in
solution quality and achieves real-time inference (1--2 seconds) versus
100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong
generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time
constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter
distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively
balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly
suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid
decision-making is essential for saving lives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NCAP安全评级从被动安全扩展到包含ADAS主动安全技术，需要实证研究这些系统如何相互作用，以及它们与车辆基本特征共同预测最高安全评级的能力。

Method: 使用包含5,128辆车的NCAP数据集，比较逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升和支持向量机四种模型，采用5折分层交叉验证，并对最佳模型进行超参数优化。

Result: 随机森林和梯度提升表现最佳，优化后的随机森林在测试集上达到89.18%准确率和0.9586 ROC AUC。车重和车型年份贡献超过55%的特征重要性，但ADAS功能也有意义。

Conclusion: 机器学习能有效分析大规模NCAP数据，传统车辆参数和现代ADAS功能共同对获得顶级安全评级具有重要预测价值。

Abstract: Vehicle safety assessment is crucial for consumer information and regulatory
oversight. The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) assigns standardized safety
ratings, which traditionally emphasize passive safety measures but now include
active safety technologies such as Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS).
It is crucial to understand how these various systems interact empirically.
This study explores whether particular ADAS features like Forward Collision
Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Crash Imminent Braking, and Blind Spot
Detection, together with established vehicle attributes (e.g., Curb Weight,
Model Year, Vehicle Type, Drive Train), can reliably predict a vehicle's
likelihood of earning the highest (5-star) overall NCAP rating. Using a
publicly available dataset derived from NCAP reports that contain approximately
5,128 vehicle variants spanning model years 2011-2025, we compared four
different machine learning models: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and support vector classifier (SVC) using a 5-fold stratified
cross-validation approach. The two best-performing algorithms (random forest
and gradient boost) were hyperparameter optimized using RandomizedSearchCV.
Analysis of feature importance showed that basic vehicle characteristics,
specifically curb weight and model year, dominated predictive capability,
contributing more than 55% of the feature relevance of the Random Forest model.
However, the inclusion of ADAS features also provided meaningful predictive
contributions. The optimized Random Forest model achieved robust results on a
held-out test set, with an accuracy of 89.18% and a ROC AUC of 0.9586. This
research reveals the use of machine learning to analyze large-scale NCAP data
and highlights the combined predictive importance of both established vehicle
parameters and modern ADAS features to achieve top safety ratings.

Motivation: 解决简单机器人群体（Ant Robots）在有限感知、无通信和集中控制的复杂环境中保持群体凝聚力和避免分裂的关键挑战，特别是在火灾救援等紧急响应场景中需要快速有效的群体协作。

Method: 提出VariAntNet深度学习模型，包含从无序变长局部观测中提取几何特征，采用基于可见性图拉普拉斯矩阵特性的新型可微分多目标损失函数来促进群体凝聚力。

Result: 在基本多智能体聚集任务中，VariAntNet显著优于现有解析解决方案，收敛速度提高一倍以上，同时在不同群体规模下保持高群体连通性。

Conclusion: 在时间关键的紧急响应场景中，虽然解析方法能保证凝聚力但速度太慢，VariAntNet在收敛速度和群体凝聚力之间提供了更好的权衡，证明了深度学习在分散控制中的有效性。

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response
applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in
complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent
communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known
as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing
capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate
explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in
maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing.
Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the
classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep
learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent
swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric
features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It
incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel,
differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that
promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph
Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent
gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must
gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing
analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while
maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the
analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In
time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are
at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some
agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in
detail.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains
requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making.
However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer
from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found
that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose
standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art
performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework
that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a
bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked
Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard
deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching.
Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons
demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved
coverage compared to strong baselines.

Abstract: Causal disentanglement from soft interventions is identifiable under the
assumptions of linear interventional faithfulness and availability of both

problem from the perspective of i.i.d. data. Here, we develop a framework,
GraCE-VAE, for non-i.i.d. settings, in which structured context in the form of
network data is available. GraCE-VAE integrates discrepancy-based variational
autoencoders with graph neural networks to jointly recover the true latent
causal graph and intervention effects. We show that the theoretical results of
identifiability from i.i.d. data hold in our setup. We also empirically
evaluate GraCE-VAE against state-of-the-art baselines on three genetic
perturbation datasets to demonstrate the impact of leveraging structured
context for causal disentanglement.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely
and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex
sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility
and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face
practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to
distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with
explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a
Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as
return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and
modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with
CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile
regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system
with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference.
Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show
that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity
while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent,
the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification
decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more
relevant.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models
into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and
their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several
existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance
the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for
model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is
computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we
develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to
realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define
two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to
predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate
that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and
simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: Simulating ecohydrological processes is essential for understanding complex
environmental systems and guiding sustainable management amid accelerating
climate change and human pressures. Process-based models provide physical
realism but can suffer from structural rigidity, high computational costs, and
complex calibration, while machine learning (ML) methods are efficient and
flexible yet often lack interpretability and transferability. We propose a
unified three-phase framework that integrates process-based models with ML and
progressively embeds them into artificial intelligence (AI) through knowledge
distillation. Phase I, behavioral distillation, enhances process models via
surrogate learning and model simplification to capture key dynamics at lower
computational cost. Phase II, structural distillation, reformulates process
equations as modular components within a graph neural network (GNN), enabling
multiscale representation and seamless integration with ML models. Phase III,
cognitive distillation, embeds expert reasoning and adaptive decision-making
into intelligent modeling agents using the Eyes-Brain-Hands-Mouth architecture.
Demonstrations for the Samish watershed highlight the framework's applicability
to ecohydrological modeling, showing that it can reproduce process-based model
outputs, improve predictive accuracy, and support scenario-based
decision-making. The framework offers a scalable and transferable pathway
toward next-generation intelligent ecohydrological modeling systems, with the
potential extension to other process-based domains.

Abstract: Complementary Learning Systems theory holds that intelligent agents need two
learning systems. Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense,
overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory
is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations
and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this
duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by
predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the
neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on
auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic
capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this
paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore
its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall
the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small
number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not
generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic
learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall
capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded
gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in
a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated
representations as found in the hippocampus.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is useful to obtain a predictive distribution with a small
generalization error. However, since posterior distributions are rarely
evaluated analytically, we employ the variational Bayesian inference or
sampling method to approximate posterior distributions. When we obtain samples
from a posterior distribution, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been widely
used for the continuous variable part and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for
the discrete variable part. Another sampling method, the bouncy particle
sampler (BPS), has been proposed, which combines uniform linear motion and
stochastic reflection to perform sampling. BPS was reported to have the
advantage of being easier to set simulation parameters than HMC. To accelerate
the convergence to a posterior distribution, we introduced parallel tempering
(PT) to BPS, and then proposed an algorithm when the inverse temperature
exchange rate is set to infinity. We performed numerical simulations and
demonstrated its effectiveness for multimodal distribution.

Abstract: Processing data that lies on multiple interacting (product) graphs is
increasingly important in practical applications, yet existing methods are
mostly restricted to discrete graph filtering. Tensorial partial differential
equations on graphs (TPDEGs) offer a principled framework for modeling such
multidomain data in a continuous setting. However, current continuous
approaches are limited to first-order derivatives, which tend to dampen
high-frequency signals and slow down information propagation. This makes these
TPDEGs-based approaches less effective for capturing complex, multi-scale, and
heterophilic structures. In this paper, we introduce second-order TPDEGs
(So-TPDEGs) and propose the first theoretically grounded framework for
second-order continuous product graph neural networks. Our approach leverages
the separability of cosine kernels in Cartesian product graphs to implement
efficient spectral decomposition, while naturally preserving high-frequency
information. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses of stability under graph
perturbations and over-smoothing behavior regarding spectral properties. Our
theoretical results establish a robust foundation for advancing continuous
graph learning across multiple practical domains.

Abstract: Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations
management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple
yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming
(GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may
lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key
reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that
the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive
understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm
with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high
performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure,
which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while
minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the
problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear
programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical
programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our
method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the
dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering
their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential
advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of
simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach
managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the
manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP
methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In
addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into
the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够模拟大气三维结构、响应气候变化强迫，同时保持计算效率和长期稳定性的轻量级气候模拟器，为快速实验和耦合气候动力学研究提供工具。

Method: 基于原始LUCIE-2D框架，采用球面傅里叶神经算子(SFNO)主干网络，使用30年ERA5再分析数据在8个垂直σ层上进行训练，将大气CO2作为强迫变量，可选整合海表温度(SST)来模拟海气耦合动力学。

Result: LUCIE-3D成功再现了气候学平均值、变率和长期气候变化信号，包括CO2浓度增加下的地表增温和平流层冷却。模型还捕捉了赤道开尔文波、马登-朱利安振荡和环状模等关键动力过程，在极端事件统计方面表现出可信行为。

Abstract: We introduce LUCIE-3D, a lightweight three-dimensional climate emulator
designed to capture the vertical structure of the atmosphere, respond to
climate change forcings, and maintain computational efficiency with long-term
stability. Building on the original LUCIE-2D framework, LUCIE-3D employs a
Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) backbone and is trained on 30 years of
ERA5 reanalysis data spanning eight vertical {\sigma}-levels. The model
incorporates atmospheric CO2 as a forcing variable and optionally integrates
prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) to simulate coupled ocean--atmosphere
dynamics. Results demonstrate that LUCIE-3D successfully reproduces
climatological means, variability, and long-term climate change signals,
including surface warming and stratospheric cooling under increasing CO2
concentrations. The model further captures key dynamical processes such as
equatorial Kelvin waves, the Madden--Julian Oscillation, and annular modes,
while showing credible behavior in the statistics of extreme events. Despite
requiring longer training than its 2D predecessor, LUCIE-3D remains efficient,
training in under five hours on four GPUs. Its combination of stability,
physical consistency, and accessibility makes it a valuable tool for rapid
experimentation, ablation studies, and the exploration of coupled climate
dynamics, with potential applications extending to paleoclimate research and
future Earth system emulation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models by
learning to iteratively reverse the noising process. Their ability to generate
high-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other
complex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse
and unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,
we observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the
majority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing
approaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we
introduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel
density estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale
$\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these
data-dependent $\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the
denoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of
protein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields
consistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of
data-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional
settings.

TL;DR: CIML是一个新的信息理论多视图学习框架，摒弃了传统多视图冗余假设，同时利用共同信息和独特信息进行预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视图学习方法基于多视图冗余假设，只关注视图间的共同信息，而忽略了每个视图独特信息的预测潜力。

Method: 通过最大化Gacs-Korner共同信息提取共享特征，使用信息瓶颈压缩任务相关表示；同时为每个视图使用信息瓶颈获得最压缩的独特表示，并最小化独特与共同表示之间以及不同独特表示之间的互信息。

Result: 理论证明学习到的联合表示对下游任务具有预测充分性，大量实验结果表明模型优于多个最先进方法。

Conclusion: CIML框架成功突破了传统多视图冗余假设的限制，充分利用了共同和独特信息的预测能力，在多视图学习中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Information theory has inspired numerous advancements in multi-view learning.
Most multi-view methods incorporating information-theoretic principles rely an
assumption called multi-view redundancy which states that common information
between views is necessary and sufficient for down-stream tasks. This
assumption emphasizes the importance of common information for prediction, but
inherently ignores the potential of unique information in each view that could
be predictive to the task. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive
information-theoretic multi-view learning framework named CIML, which discards
the assumption of multi-view redundancy. Specifically, CIML considers the
potential predictive capabilities of both common and unique information based
on information theory. First, the common representation learning maximizes
Gacs-Korner common information to extract shared features and then compresses
this information to learn task-relevant representations based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB). For unique representation learning, IB is employed
to achieve the most compressed unique representation for each view while
simultaneously minimizing the mutual information between unique and common
representations, as well as among different unique representations.
Importantly, we theoretically prove that the learned joint representation is
predictively sufficient for the downstream task. Extensive experimental results
have demonstrated the superiority of our model over several state-of-art
methods. The code is released on CIML.

Result: 方法在任务数量增长时保持稳健， consistently outperforms prior work。

Conclusion: 该方法为多任务模型融合提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在不增加标注成本的情况下维持各任务的强性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is often achieved by merging datasets before
fine-tuning, but the growing availability of fine-tuned models has led to new
approaches such as model merging via task arithmetic. A major challenge in this
setting is task interference, which worsens as the number of tasks increases.
We propose a method that merges models trained on different tasks into a single
model, maintaining strong performance across all tasks. Our approach leverages
Jensen-Shannon divergence to guide the merging process without requiring
additional labelled data, and automatically balances task importance. Unlike
existing methods, our approach remains robust as the number of tasks grows and
consistently outperforms prior work.

Abstract: The Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is a central tool in statistics
and machine learning, widely used for latent-variable models such as Gaussian
Mixture Models (GMMs). Despite its ubiquity, EM is typically treated as a
non-differentiable black box, preventing its integration into modern learning
pipelines where end-to-end gradient propagation is essential. In this work, we
present and compare several differentiation strategies for EM, from full
automatic differentiation to approximate methods, assessing their accuracy and
computational efficiency. As a key application, we leverage this differentiable
EM in the computation of the Mixture Wasserstein distance $\mathrm{MW}_2$
between GMMs, allowing $\mathrm{MW}_2$ to be used as a differentiable loss in
imaging and machine learning tasks. To complement our practical use of
$\mathrm{MW}_2$, we contribute a novel stability result which provides
theoretical justification for the use of $\mathrm{MW}_2$ with EM, and also
introduce a novel unbalanced variant of $\mathrm{MW}_2$. Numerical experiments
on barycentre computation, colour and style transfer, image generation, and
texture synthesis illustrate the versatility and effectiveness of the proposed
approach in different settings.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandit problems, the typical goal is to identify the arm with
the highest reward. This paper explores a threshold-based bandit problem,
aiming to select an arm based on its relation to a prescribed threshold \(\tau
\). We study variants where the optimal arm is the first above \(\tau\), the
\(k^{th}\) arm above or below it, or the closest to it, under a monotonic
structure of arm means. We derive asymptotic regret lower bounds, showing
dependence only on arms adjacent to \(\tau\). Motivated by applications in
communication networks (CQI allocation), clinical dosing, energy management,
recommendation systems, and more. We propose algorithms with optimality
validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Our work extends classical bandit
theory with threshold constraints for efficient decision-making.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

Abstract: Identifying a causal model of an IT system is fundamental to many branches of
systems engineering and operation. Such a model can be used to predict the
effects of control actions, optimize operations, diagnose failures, detect
intrusions, etc., which is central to achieving the longstanding goal of
automating network and system management tasks. Traditionally, causal models
have been designed and maintained by domain experts. This, however, proves
increasingly challenging with the growing complexity and dynamism of modern IT
systems. In this paper, we present the first principled method for online,
data-driven identification of an IT system in the form of a causal model. The
method, which we call active causal learning, estimates causal functions that
capture the dependencies among system variables in an iterative fashion using
Gaussian process regression based on system measurements, which are collected
through a rollout-based intervention policy. We prove that this method is
optimal in the Bayesian sense and that it produces effective interventions.
Experimental validation on a testbed shows that our method enables accurate
identification of a causal system model while inducing low interference with
system operations.

Conclusion: 预测误差对优化解质量的影响复杂且非平凡，需要在预测然后优化框架中更仔细地考虑预测质量与决策质量之间的关系，这对实际应用中的系统设计和评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: Uncertainty in optimization is often represented as stochastic parameters in
the optimization model. In Predict-Then-Optimize approaches, predictions of a
machine learning model are used as values for such parameters, effectively
transforming the stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one. This
two-stage framework is built on the assumption that more accurate predictions
result in solutions that are closer to the actual optimal solution. However,
providing evidence for this assumption in the context of complex, constrained
optimization problems is challenging and often overlooked in the literature.
Simulating predictions of machine learning models offers a way to
(experimentally) analyze how prediction error impacts solution quality without
the need to train real models. Complementing an algorithm from the literature
for simulating binary classification, we introduce a new algorithm for
simulating predictions of multiclass classifiers. We conduct a computational
study to evaluate the performance of these algorithms, and show that classifier
performance can be simulated with reasonable accuracy, although some
variability is observed. Additionally, we apply these algorithms to assess the
performance of a Predict-Then-Optimize algorithm for a machine scheduling
problem. The experiments demonstrate that the relationship between prediction
error and how close solutions are to the actual optimum is non-trivial,
highlighting important considerations for the design and evaluation of
decision-making systems based on machine learning predictions.

Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques that systematically
applies the chain rule to compute the gradients of functions without requiring
human intervention. Although the fundamentals of this technology were
established decades ago, it is experiencing a renaissance as it plays a key
role in efficiently computing gradients for backpropagation in machine learning
algorithms. AD is also crucial for many applications in scientific computing
domains, particularly emerging techniques that integrate machine learning
models within scientific simulations and schemes. Existing AD frameworks have
four main limitations: limited support of programming languages, requiring code
modifications for AD compatibility, limited performance on scientific computing
codes, and a naive store-all solution for forward-pass data required for
gradient calculations. These limitations force domain scientists to manually
compute the gradients for large problems. This work presents DaCe AD, a
general, efficient automatic differentiation engine that requires no code
modifications. DaCe AD uses a novel ILP-based algorithm to optimize the
trade-off between storing and recomputing to achieve maximum performance within
a given memory constraint. We showcase the generality of our method by applying
it to NPBench, a suite of HPC benchmarks with diverse scientific computing
patterns, where we outperform JAX, a Python framework with state-of-the-art
general AD capabilities, by more than 92 times on average without requiring any
code changes.

observes the realized request and must take an irrevocable action that yields a
reward or incurs a cost, without knowledge of future arrivals. We introduce a
bounded-influence framework, in which past decisions and requests exert only
limited impact on the future optimal reward. Within this framework, we propose
the AdaSwitch meta-algorithm, which exploits predictions to attain performance
close to the offline benchmark when predictions are accurate, while preserving
classical competitive-ratio guarantees under highly inaccurate predictions. Our
framework and meta-algorithm apply to diverse settings, including lead-time
quotation in processing systems, the $k$-server problem, and online allocation
of reusable resources. These applications illustrate the flexibility and broad
applicability of our approach to learning-augmented online decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实文本分类任务中经常存在类别不平衡问题，传统过采样方法在处理文本数据时面临特征空间扩展的独特挑战，需要专门针对文本特性的解决方案

Method: 基于马尔可夫链的文本过采样方法，从少数类估计转移概率，同时部分利用多数类的信息，允许在过采样过程中扩展少数类特征空间

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的评估表明，该方法相比其他主流过采样方法能够产生极具竞争力的结果，特别是在严重不平衡情况下表现突出

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了文本不平衡分类中的特征空间扩展问题，为处理严重不平衡文本数据提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Text classification is the task of automatically assigning text documents
correct labels from a predefined set of categories. In real-life (text)
classification tasks, observations and misclassification costs are often
unevenly distributed between the classes - known as the problem of imbalanced
data. Synthetic oversampling is a popular approach to imbalanced
classification. The idea is to generate synthetic observations in the minority
class to balance the classes in the training set. Many general-purpose
oversampling methods can be applied to text data; however, imbalanced text data
poses a number of distinctive difficulties that stem from the unique nature of
text compared to other domains. One such factor is that when the sample size of
text increases, the sample vocabulary (i.e., feature space) is likely to grow
as well. We introduce a novel Markov chain based text oversampling method. The
transition probabilities are estimated from the minority class but also partly
from the majority class, thus allowing the minority feature space to expand in
oversampling. We evaluate our approach against prominent oversampling methods
and show that our approach is able to produce highly competitive results
against the other methods in several real data examples, especially when the
imbalance is severe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估数据集复杂性对于知识图谱链接预测模型的比较至关重要，需要验证CSG指标在此领域的实际有效性

Method: 在标准知识图谱链接预测基准上（如FB15k-237、WN18RR等），通过系统改变CSG计算的两个关键参数（M-蒙特卡洛采样点数，K-最近邻数量）来评估CSG的行为特性

Result: 研究发现CSG对K值选择高度敏感，不能随目标类别数量自然扩展；CSG值与标准性能指标（如平均倒数排名MRR）相关性弱或无相关性；CSG在链接预测场景中的稳定性和泛化预测能力失效

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在知识图谱链接预测评估中需要开发更鲁棒、分类器无关的复杂性度量方法，CSG指标在当前形式下不适合用于此目的

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Motivation: 随着人工神经网络逐渐成为测量系统的组成部分，需要理解它们如何处理和传输参数相关信息，特别是Fisher信息在神经网络内部的传播过程。

Method: 开发了一种方法来监控Fisher信息在神经网络中的流动，从输入层到输出层跟踪信息传输，并将其作为训练停止标准。

Result: 研究表明最优估计性能对应于Fisher信息的最大传输，过度训练会导致信息损失和过拟合，该方法提供了无需验证数据集的模型无关停止准则。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际成像实验数据上得到验证，展示了其在现实物理场景中的有效性，为神经网络训练提供了基于信息理论的新停止标准。

Abstract: The estimation of continuous parameters from measured data plays a central
role in many fields of physics. A key tool in understanding and improving such
estimation processes is the concept of Fisher information, which quantifies how
information about unknown parameters propagates through a physical system and
determines the ultimate limits of precision. With Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) gradually becoming an integral part of many measurement systems, it is
essential to understand how they process and transmit parameter-relevant
information internally. Here, we present a method to monitor the flow of Fisher
information through an ANN performing a parameter estimation task, tracking it
from the input to the output layer. We show that optimal estimation performance
corresponds to the maximal transmission of Fisher information, and that
training beyond this point results in information loss due to overfitting. This
provides a model-free stopping criterion for network training-eliminating the
need for a separate validation dataset. To demonstrate the practical relevance
of our approach, we apply it to a network trained on data from an imaging
experiment, highlighting its effectiveness in a realistic physical setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的线性预条件化方法虽然在表示局部二次损失曲率方面有效，但对复杂的损失几何结构效果有限。需要一种更灵活的方法来处理幻象的损失距离计量问题。

Method: 通过学习一个由表达力强的神经网络实现的多用途距离生成函数，该函数引入一个非线性镜像映射，能够有效捐捕和优化广泛的损失几何结构。

Result: 该方法在少样本学习数据集上表现出优异的经验性能力，并显示出迅速的每件任务收敛速度，显著减少了适配步骤的数量。分析结果证明了该方法的收敛性，其收敛速度为∆(ϵ^{-2})，与标准的基于梯度的元学习方法相当。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新题方法通过非线性镜像映射有效处理复杂的损失几何结构，实现了样本高效的元学习适配，为大规模元学习模型提供了一种更加灵活和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Utilizing task-invariant knowledge acquired from related tasks as prior
information, meta-learning offers a principled approach to learning a new task
with limited data records. Sample-efficient adaptation of this prior
information is a major challenge facing meta-learning, and plays an important
role because it facilitates training the sought task-specific model with just a
few optimization steps. Past works deal with this challenge through
preconditioning that speeds up convergence of the per-task training. Though
effective in representing locally quadratic loss curvatures, simple linear
preconditioning can be hardly potent with complex loss geometries. Instead of
relying on a quadratic distance metric, the present contribution copes with
complex loss metrics by learning a versatile distance-generating function,
which induces a nonlinear mirror map to effectively capture and optimize a wide
range of loss geometries. With suitable parameterization, this generating
function is effected by an expressive neural network that is provably a valid
distance. Analytical results establish convergence of not only the proposed
method, but also all meta-learning approaches based on preconditioning. To
attain gradient norm less than $\epsilon$, the convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ is on par with standard gradient-based
meta-learning methods. Numerical tests on few-shot learning datasets
demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the novel algorithm, as well
as its rapid per-task convergence, which markedly reduces the number of
adaptation steps, hence also accommodating large-scale meta-learning models.

TL;DR: VASSO方法通过抑制方差来稳定SAM中的对抗扰动，解决了SAM存在的"过度友好对抗"问题，在多个视觉和语言任务上验证了更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM方法虽然通过寻找平坦最小值来提升泛化能力，但在实践中存在"过度友好对抗"问题，这会限制模型的最终泛化水平。

Method: 提出VASSO（方差抑制）方法来稳定对抗扰动，通过抑制扰动方差来避免过度友好的对抗样本，从而获得更好的泛化性能。

Result: 在广泛的视觉和语言任务上验证了VASSO+SAM组合的优越性能，相比原始SAM获得了更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VASSO提供了一种通用的对抗扰动稳定方法，与计算高效的SAM变体结合时，能够实现理想的泛化-计算权衡。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has well-documented merits in enhancing
generalization of deep neural network models. Accounting for sharpness in the
loss function geometry, where neighborhoods of `flat minima' heighten
generalization ability, SAM seeks `flat valleys' by minimizing the maximum loss
provoked by an adversarial perturbation within the neighborhood. Although
critical to account for sharpness of the loss function, in practice SAM suffers
from `over-friendly adversaries,' which can curtail the outmost level of
generalization. To avoid such `friendliness,' the present contribution fosters
stabilization of adversaries through variance suppression (VASSO). VASSO offers
a general approach to provably stabilize adversaries. In particular, when
integrating VASSO with SAM, improved generalizability is numerically validated
on extensive vision and language tasks. Once applied on top of a
computationally efficient SAM variant, VASSO offers a desirable
generalization-computation tradeoff.

Method: 使用变分图自编码器(VGAEs)，基于ENGAGE和DINGO两个开源数据集，评估四种解码器变体，通过结构和频谱指标比较生成网络与原始电网

Result: 简单解码器无法捕捉真实拓扑，GCN方法在ENGAGE数据集上表现良好但在更复杂的DINGO数据集上产生断开组件和重复模式等伪影

Abstract: To address the lack of public power system data for machine learning research
in energy networks, we investigate the use of variational graph autoencoders
(VGAEs) for synthetic distribution grid generation. Using two open-source
datasets, ENGAGE and DINGO, we evaluate four decoder variants and compare
generated networks against the original grids using structural and spectral
metrics. Results indicate that simple decoders fail to capture realistic
topologies, while GCN-based approaches achieve strong fidelity on ENGAGE but
struggle on the more complex DINGO dataset, producing artifacts such as
disconnected components and repeated motifs. These findings highlight both the
promise and limitations of VGAEs for grid synthesis, underscoring the need for
more expressive generative models and robust evaluation. We release our models
and analysis as open source to support benchmarking and accelerate progress in
ML-driven power system research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮工具集成推理(LLM+外部工具)的强化学习训练存在不稳定性和性能崩溃问题，主要原因是外部工具反馈导致的分布漂移和低概率token生成，引发灾难性梯度爆炸。

Method: 提出SimpleTIR算法，核心策略是识别并过滤掉包含无效轮次(既不生成代码块也不产生最终答案)的轨迹，从策略更新中移除这些有问题的轨迹，阻断有害的高幅度梯度。

Result: 在数学推理基准上实现最先进性能，将AIME24分数从文本基线的22.1提升到50.5(Qwen2.5-7B基础模型)，并促进模型发现多样化的推理模式如自我纠正和交叉验证。

Conclusion: SimpleTIR是一种即插即用的算法，通过过滤无效轨迹有效稳定多轮工具集成推理的训练过程，避免了监督微调的限制，使模型能够探索更复杂的推理模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning
capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios
using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and
performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by
a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation
of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing
catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To
address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that
stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter
out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code
block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the
policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude
gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math
reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only
baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model.
Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR
encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns,
such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Conclusion: HydroGAT通过高分辨率流域图建模和时空注意力机制，显著提升了洪水预测精度，并提供可解释的注意力图谱，揭示了稀疏的结构化流域间影响关系

Abstract: Accurate flood forecasting remains a challenge for water-resource management,
as it demands modeling of local, time-varying runoff drivers (e.g.,
rainfall-induced peaks, baseflow trends) and complex spatial interactions
across a river network. Traditional data-driven approaches, such as
convolutional networks and sequence-based models, ignore topological
information about the region. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate
information exactly along the river network, which is ideal for learning
hydrological routing. However, state-of-the-art GNN-based flood prediction
models collapse pixels to coarse catchment polygons as the cost of training
explodes with graph size and higher resolution. Furthermore, most existing
methods treat spatial and temporal dependencies separately, either applying
GNNs solely on spatial graphs or transformers purely on temporal sequences,
thus failing to simultaneously capture spatiotemporal interactions critical for
accurate flood prediction. We introduce a heterogenous basin graph where every
land and river pixel is a node connected by physical hydrological flow
directions and inter-catchment relationships. We propose HydroGAT, a
spatiotemporal network that adaptively learns local temporal importance and the
most influential upstream locations. Evaluated in two Midwestern US basins and
across five baseline architectures, our model achieves higher NSE (up to 0.97),
improved KGE (up to 0.96), and low bias (PBIAS within $\pm$5%) in hourly
discharge prediction, while offering interpretable attention maps that reveal
sparse, structured intercatchment influences. To support high-resolution
basin-scale training, we develop a distributed data-parallel pipeline that
scales efficiently up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer,
demonstrating up to 15x speedup across machines. Our code is available at

Abstract: B\"uchi automata (BAs) recognize $\omega$-regular languages defined by formal
specifications like linear temporal logic (LTL) and are commonly used in the
verification of reactive systems. However, BAs face scalability challenges when
handling and manipulating complex system behaviors. As neural networks are
increasingly used to address these scalability challenges in areas like model
checking, investigating their ability to generalize beyond training data
becomes necessary. This work presents the first study investigating whether
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can generalize to $\omega$-regular languages
derived from LTL formulas. We train RNNs on ultimately periodic $\omega$-word
sequences to replicate target BA behavior and evaluate how well they generalize
to out-of-distribution sequences. Through experiments on LTL formulas
corresponding to deterministic automata of varying structural complexity, from
3 to over 100 states, we show that RNNs achieve high accuracy on their target
$\omega$-regular languages when evaluated on sequences up to $8 \times$ longer
than training examples, with $92.6\%$ of tasks achieving perfect or
near-perfect generalization. These results establish the feasibility of neural
approaches for learning complex $\omega$-regular languages, suggesting their
potential as components in neurosymbolic verification methods.

Conclusion: MoPEQ方法有效解决了MoE模型部署的内存挑战，为混合精度量化提供了深入的分析和理解

Abstract: Large Language and Vision Models using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture pose significant challenges for deployment due to their
computational and memory demands. Mixed Precision Quantization assigns
different precisions to different layers of an LLM/VLM based on layer
sensitivity and importance within the model. In this work, we propose a Post
Training Quantization algorithm, MoPEQ, that assigns optimal bit width to each
expert. Our method balances accuracy and model size by analyzing each expert's
sensitivity using Hessian trace approximation instead of relying on the
activation frequency of the expert. This per-expert granularity approach
clusters similar experts to maintain model performance while reducing memory
requirements. The experimental results on VLMEvalKit benchmark datasets using
State-of-the-art VLMs Deepseek-VL2 -tiny, -small, -base, and MolmoE models
demonstrate that our mixed precision quantized MoEs achieve competitive
accuracy with substantial improvements in memory footprint compared to
uniform-precision baseline methods. We perform a comprehensive study to analyze
the impact of expert activation frequency and sensitivity using Hessian trace
approximation at both layer-wise and model-wide expert precision allocation of
2, 3, and 4 bits to provide a thorough understanding of mixed precision
quantization of VLM-MoEs.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Conclusion: 提供了关于SAE是否处于这种病理机制的初步讨论，对理解SAE在实际应用中的表现具有重要意义

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as
linear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).
The ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the
number of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the
neural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in
particular, to understand how "feature manifolds" (multi-dimensional features)
influence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers
distinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the
pathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than
there are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether
or not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.

Method: 对347篇论文进行系统性文献综述，筛选出24项主要研究，从六个维度进行编码分析：缓解技术、处理偏见类型、动态测试设置、评估重点、应用领域和机器学习任务。

Result: 构建了一个可重用的分类法，发现大多数研究只报告公平性或性能指标，只有6项研究同时考虑两者；存在共享模拟器缺乏、评估指标不一致等问题。

Conclusion: 该分类法为行业从业者提供了选择稳健方法的快速检查清单，并为研究人员指明了该领域最紧迫的研究空白，如需要开发共享模拟器和统一评估标准。

Abstract: Recommender systems continually retrain on user reactions to their own
predictions, creating AI feedback loops that amplify biases and diminish
fairness over time. Despite this well-known risk, most bias mitigation
techniques are tested only on static splits, so their long-term fairness across
multiple retraining rounds remains unclear. We therefore present a systematic
literature review of bias mitigation methods that explicitly consider AI
feedback loops and are validated in multi-round simulations or live A/B tests.
Screening 347 papers yields 24 primary studies published between 2019-2025.
Each study is coded on six dimensions: mitigation technique, biases addressed,
dynamic testing set-up, evaluation focus, application domain, and ML task,
organising them into a reusable taxonomy. The taxonomy offers industry
practitioners a quick checklist for selecting robust methods and gives
researchers a clear roadmap to the field's most urgent gaps. Examples include
the shortage of shared simulators, varying evaluation metrics, and the fact
that most studies report either fairness or performance; only six use both.

### [224] [Algorithm Adaptation Bias in Recommendation System Online Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00199)
*Chen Zheng,Zhenyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推荐系统在线实验中的算法适应偏差问题，这种偏差源于生产模型、用户数据和训练管道之间的飞轮效应，导致小流量测试组的结果无法准确反映全量部署后的真实效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线实验(A/B测试)是评估推荐系统变体的黄金标准，但算法适应偏差会扭曲实验结果并误导决策。这种偏差导致实验往往偏向大流量的生产版本，而低估小流量测试版本的性能，从而错失真正的优胜方案。

Method: 详细分析了算法适应偏差的产生机制，通过真实世界实验提供实证证据，并讨论了涵盖实验设计、测量和调整的解决方案。

Result: 研究发现实验环境中的测量效果与全量部署后的真实影响存在显著差异，实验结果系统性地偏向现有生产系统。

Conclusion: 需要提高对算法适应偏差的认识，将其置于推荐系统评估偏差的更广泛背景中，并推动开发更稳健的在线评估方法。

Abstract: Online experiments (A/B tests) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
evaluating recommender system variants and guiding launch decisions. However, a
variety of biases can distort the results of the experiment and mislead
decision-making. An underexplored but critical bias is algorithm adaptation
effect. This bias arises from the flywheel dynamics among production models,
user data, and training pipelines: new models are evaluated on user data whose
distributions are shaped by the incumbent system or tested only in a small
treatment group. As a result, the measured effect of a new product change in
modeling and user experience in this constrained experimental setting can
diverge substantially from its true impact in full deployment. In practice, the
experiment results often favor the production variant with large traffic while
underestimating the performance of the test variant with small traffic, which
leads to missing opportunities to launch a true winning arm or underestimating
the impact. This paper aims to raise awareness of algorithm adaptation bias,
situate it within the broader landscape of RecSys evaluation biases, and
motivate discussion of solutions that span experiment design, measurement, and
adjustment. We detail the mechanisms of this bias, present empirical evidence
from real-world experiments, and discuss potential methods for a more robust
online evaluation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DPG-Diff是一个新的扩散模型，用于跨域序列推荐，通过解耦域不变和域特定偏好来提升推荐质量并减少负迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐中，简单的序列信号聚合会导致域特定偏好冲突和负迁移问题，同时噪声行为（如误点击）在域异质性下被放大。现有扩散模型在推荐应用中存在局限性，无法有效分离共享和域特定偏好或忽略时间动态。

Method: 提出DPG-Diff模型，将用户偏好解耦为域不变和域特定组件，共同指导反向扩散过程，实现稳健的跨域知识迁移和噪声过滤。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，DPG-Diff在多个指标上 consistently 优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DPG-Diff是首个为跨域序列推荐量身定制的基于扩散的方法，通过解耦偏好指导有效解决了负迁移和噪声问题，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across
domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of
sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences,
leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already
suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR
further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse
item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three
intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences,
and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework
well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness
to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making
them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing
applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often
conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain
collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability
to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose
\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the
first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge.
DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific
components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This
disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates
negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.

*Yuzheng Cai,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Mingxin Li,Pengjun Xie,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ERank是一个基于推理大语言模型的高效点式重排序器，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）解决了当前重排序模型在评分区分度和效率之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的重排序器面临根本性权衡：监督微调的点式方法缺乏评分区分度，而复杂的列表式方法效率低下，不适合低延迟应用。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1）监督微调阶段，训练模型输出细粒度整数分数而非二元标签；2）强化学习阶段，使用新颖的列表式奖励进一步优化，将全局排序意识注入高效的点式架构。

Result: 在BRIGHT、FollowIR、TREC DL和BEIR基准测试中表现优异。在推理密集的BRIGHT基准上，ERank-4B达到nDCG@10为38.7，32B变体达到最先进的40.2。

Conclusion: ERank成功解决了重排序模型在效果和效率之间的权衡问题，在保持高效点式架构的同时实现了卓越的排序性能。

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Conclusion: 本论文系统评论了开放数据集搜索领域的最新进展，并提出了未来研究方向和挑战，为该领域的研空人员和实践者提供了结构化的参考。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are typically required for accomplishing data-driven
tasks, such as training medical diagnosis models, predicting real-time traffic
conditions, or conducting experiments to validate research hypotheses.
Consequently, open dataset search, which aims to ensure the efficient and
accurate fulfillment of users' dataset requirements, has emerged as a critical
research challenge and has attracted widespread interest. Recent studies have
made notable progress in enhancing the flexibility and intelligence of open
dataset search, and large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
potential in addressing long-standing challenges in this area. Therefore, a
systematic and comprehensive review of the open dataset search problem is
essential, detailing the current state of research and exploring future
directions. In this survey, we focus on recent advances in open dataset search
beyond traditional approaches that rely on metadata and keywords. From the
perspective of dataset modalities, we place particular emphasis on
example-based dataset search, advanced similarity measurement techniques based
on dataset content, and efficient search acceleration techniques. In addition,
we emphasize the mutually beneficial relationship between LLMs and open dataset
search. On the one hand, LLMs help address complex challenges in query
understanding, semantic modeling, and interactive guidance within open dataset
search. In turn, advances in dataset search can support LLMs by enabling more
effective integration into retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and
data selection processes, thereby enhancing downstream task performance.
Finally, we summarize open research problems and outline promising directions
for future work. This work aims to offer a structured reference for researchers
and practitioners in the field of open dataset search.

Motivation: 现有PDF解析方法主要针对研究论文分割，无法有效处理法律教材等复杂结构化文档的层次化分割需求，需要开发专门的技术来处理这类包含分层知识的文档。

Method: 研究了基于目录的技术、开源结构解析工具和无需显式目录输入的LLM方法，并整合了OCR标题检测、XML特征和上下文文本特征等预处理策略来提升解析准确性。

Result: LLM结合结构感知预处理能大幅减少误报并提高提取质量；当PDF标题元数据质量高时，基于目录的方法表现优异。

Conclusion: 不同方法各有优势和局限，需要根据PDF文档的具体特征选择合适的分割技术，所有代码和数据已公开以支持复现。

Abstract: The growing demand for effective tools to parse PDF-formatted texts,
particularly structured documents such as textbooks, reveals the limitations of
current methods developed mainly for research paper segmentation. This work
addresses the challenge of hierarchical segmentation in complex structured
documents, with a focus on legal textbooks that contain layered knowledge
essential for interpreting and applying legal norms. We examine a Table of
Contents (TOC)-based technique and approaches that rely on open-source
structural parsing tools or Large Language Models (LLMs) operating without
explicit TOC input. To enhance parsing accuracy, we incorporate preprocessing
strategies such as OCR-based title detection, XML-derived features, and
contextual text features. These strategies are evaluated based on their ability
to identify section titles, allocate hierarchy levels, and determine section
boundaries. Our findings show that combining LLMs with structure-aware
preprocessing substantially reduces false positives and improves extraction
quality. We also find that when the metadata quality of headings in the PDF is
high, TOC-based techniques perform particularly well. All code and data are
publicly available to support replication. We conclude with a comparative
evaluation of the methods, outlining their respective strengths and
limitations.

TL;DR: 这章提出了一种基于检索增强生成的流水线，通过DBpedia知识库自动检索地名起源信息，以解决地理命名缺乏历史文化背景的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地名作为重要的空间参考，常常缺乏其起源信息。手动丰富这些信息需要耗时的文档查找工作，而自动化识别地名起源可以显著提高效率。

Method: 设计了一个检索增强生成流求线：首先从DBpedia提取可能与查询相关的子图，然后使用细调的语言模型（ColBERTv2和Llama2）对提取的子图进行排序并生成最终答案。

Result: 结果显示了自动检索地名起源面临的主要挑战，特别是语言模型对文本中空间信息的利用不足问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为使用检索增强生成进行地理信息检索提供了更广泛的启示，展示了在地理命名起源检索中的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Who is the "Batman" behind "Batman Street" in Melbourne? Understanding the
historical, cultural, and societal narratives behind place names can reveal the
rich context that has shaped a community. Although place names serve as
essential spatial references in gazetteers, they often lack information about
place name origins. Enriching these place names in today's gazetteers is a
time-consuming, manual process that requires extensive exploration of a vast
archive of documents and text sources. Recent advances in natural language
processing and language models (LMs) hold the promise of significant automation
of identifying place name origins due to their powerful capability to exploit
the semantics of the stored documents. This chapter presents a retrieval
augmented generation pipeline designed to search for place name origins over a
broad knowledge base, DBpedia. Given a spatial query, our approach first
extracts sub-graphs that may contain knowledge relevant to the query; then
ranks the extracted sub-graphs to generate the final answer to the query using
fine-tuned LM-based models (i.e., ColBERTv2 and Llama2). Our results highlight
the key challenges facing automated retrieval of place name origins, especially
the tendency of language models to under-use the spatial information contained
in texts as a discriminating factor. Our approach also frames the wider
implications for geographic information retrieval using retrieval augmented
generation.

TL;DR: SolveRank是一个针对竞争性编程任务的解决方案感知排序模型，通过合成数据增强，能够准确检索具有相似解决方案的问题和代码，提升代码生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 竞争性编程问题通常包含复杂的叙事背景，现有代码生成模型容易受到无关叙述的干扰。虽然RAG方法通过检索参考代码可以提升性能，但现有检索模型只关注表面语义相似性，忽略了解决方案层面的逻辑相似性这一关键因素。

Method: 利用DeepSeek-R1生成逻辑等价但表述不同的新问题，通过GPT-4o验证解决方案一致性。使用这些作为正样本，BM25/随机检索的问题作为负样本训练SolveRank模型。推理时从语料库中检索相关问题和代码来辅助下游代码生成器。

Result: 在xCodeEval数据集上的实验表明，SolveRank在精确率和召回率指标上优于最先进的排序方法，并且显著提升了困难问题的代码生成性能。

Conclusion: SolveRank通过解决方案感知的检索方法有效解决了竞争性编程中深层逻辑相似性的识别问题，为代码生成任务提供了更准确的参考信息。

Abstract: In competitive programming task, problem statements are often embedded within
elaborate narrative backgrounds, requiring deep understanding of the underlying
solutions to successfully complete the tasks. Current code generation models
primarily focus on token-level semantic modeling, highly susceptible to
distractions from irrelevant narrative statements. Inspired by RAG, retrieving
reference code with similar solutions may help enhance model performance on
difficult problems. However, existing retrieval models also emphasize
surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the deeper solution-level logical
similarities that are critical in competitive programming. Therefore, designing
ranking models capable of accurately identifying and retrieving problems and
corresponding codes remains an urgent research problem in competitive code
generation. In this paper, we propose SolveRank, a solution-aware ranking model
empowered by synthetic data for competitive programming tasks. Specifically, we
leverage the DeepSeek-R1 model to generate logically equivalent but differently
phrased new problems, verified by GPT-4o for solution consistency. Then, we
train SolveRank with these as positive samples and BM25/random-retrieved
problems as negatives. During inference, SolveRank retrieves relevant problems
and corresponding code from the corpus to assist a downstream code generator.
Experiments on the xCodeEval dataset demonstrate that SolveRank outperforms
SOTA ranking methods in precision and recall metrics, and boosts code
generation performance for difficult problems.

Motivation: 当前CTR模型在用户行为建模方面表现良好，但在低活跃用户场景下受到交互稀疏性的严重限制。现有数据增强方法过度依赖协同信号，忽略了物品的多模态特征，导致对低活跃用户的建模不足。

Method: 提出MARS框架：1）使用Stein核方法将文本和图像特征对齐到统一的无偏语义空间，构建多模态用户嵌入；2）通过多模态用户嵌入检索、过滤和浓缩高活跃用户的最相似行为序列来增强低活跃用户的行为序列。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过利用多模态特征和检索增强方法，有效解决了低活跃用户的交互稀疏性问题，在CTR预测任务中取得了优异性能，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction serves as a cornerstone of recommender
systems. Despite the strong performance of current CTR models based on user
behavior modeling, they are still severely limited by interaction sparsity,
especially in low-active user scenarios. To address this issue, data
augmentation of user behavior is a promising research direction. However,
existing data augmentation methods heavily rely on collaborative signals while
overlooking the rich multimodal features of items, leading to insufficient
modeling of low-active users.
  To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel framework \textbf{MARS}
(\textbf{M}odality-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{R}etrieval for \textbf{S}equence
Augmented CTR Prediction). MARS utilizes a Stein kernel-based approach to align
text and image features into a unified and unbiased semantic space to construct
multimodal user embeddings. Subsequently, each low-active user's behavior
sequence is augmented by retrieving, filtering, and concentrating the most
similar behavior sequence of high-active users via multimodal user embeddings.
Validated by extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests, our framework
MARS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves
substantial growth on core business metrics within
Kuaishou~\footnote{https://www.kuaishou.com/}. Consequently, MARS has been
successfully deployed, serving the main traffic for hundreds of millions of
users. To ensure reproducibility, we provide anonymous access to the
implementation code~\footnote{https://github.com/wangshukuan/MARS}.

Abstract: Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) is a critical yet unresolved task for
modern search systems, retrieving documents that not only satisfy a query's
information need but also adhere to its temporal constraints. This task is
shaped by two challenges: Relevance, ensuring alignment with the query's
explicit temporal requirements, and Recency, selecting the freshest document
among multiple versions. Existing methods often address the two challenges in
isolation, relying on brittle heuristics that fail in scenarios where temporal
requirements and staleness resistance are intertwined. To address this gap, we
introduce Re2Bench, a benchmark specifically designed to disentangle and
evaluate Relevance, Recency, and their hybrid combination. Building on this
foundation, we propose Re3, a unified and lightweight framework that
dynamically balances semantic and temporal information through a query-aware
gating mechanism. On Re2Bench, Re3 achieves state-of-the-art results, leading
in R@1 across all three subsets. Ablation studies with backbone sensitivity
tests confirm robustness, showing strong generalization across diverse encoders
and real-world settings. This work provides both a generalizable solution and a
principled evaluation suite, advancing the development of temporally aware
retrieval systems. Re3 and Re2Bench are available online:

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agent-based
recommendation systems with strong semantic understanding and flexible
reasoning capabilities. While LLM-based agents deployed in the cloud offer
powerful personalization, they often suffer from privacy concerns, limited
access to real-time signals, and scalability bottlenecks. Conversely, on-device
agents ensure privacy and responsiveness but lack the computational power for
global modeling and large-scale retrieval. To bridge these complementary
limitations, we propose CDA4Rec, a novel Cloud-Device collaborative framework
for sequential Recommendation, powered by dual agents: a cloud-side LLM and a
device-side small language model (SLM). CDA4Rec tackles the core challenge of
cloud-device coordination by decomposing the recommendation task into modular
sub-tasks including semantic modeling, candidate retrieval, structured user
modeling, and final ranking, which are allocated to cloud or device based on
computational demands and privacy sensitivity. A strategy planning mechanism
leverages the cloud agent's reasoning ability to generate personalized
execution plans, enabling context-aware task assignment and partial parallel
execution across agents. This design ensures real-time responsiveness, improved
efficiency, and fine-grained personalization, even under diverse user states
and behavioral sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDA4Rec consistently outperforms competitive
baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, validating its effectiveness in
heterogeneous and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new
markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels
and user behaviors. In this paper, we share our experiences in Coupang to
provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging
e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching

address three challenges: (1) activating cross-lingual transfer learning
abilities of LLMs through machine translation tasks; (2) enhancing query
understanding and incorporating e-commerce knowledge by retrieval-based query
augmentation; (3) mitigating the impact of training label errors through a
multi-round self-distillation training strategy. Our experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of CSRM-LLM and the proposed techniques, resulting in
successful real-world deployment and significant online gains, with a 45.8%
reduction in defect ratio and a 0.866% uplift in session purchase rate.

Conclusion: MME-SID框架成功解决了LLM-based序列推荐中的嵌入崩溃和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了推荐性能

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and
sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the
powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their
adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing
LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained
collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings
when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead
to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like
Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which
integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding
collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction
loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve
intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations,
respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the
model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior
performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse
and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly
available for reproduction:

Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems,
coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent
need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This
paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and
enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical
documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge
retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy
documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized
domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting,
summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of
losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the
limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare
domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work
highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving
institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于新闻框架多样化的推荐方法，通过控制媒体框架作为推荐管道中的可控方面，显著提高了用户接触不同叙事角度的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点击式新闻推荐系统往往局限于用户历史偏好，缺乏内容多样性。虽然基于方面的多样化方法（如情感或新闻类别）有所进展，但这些方法忽视了新闻框架在塑造故事讲述方式中的重要作用。

Method: 将媒体框架作为推荐管道中的可控方面，通过选择具有多样化框架的文章来强调不同的叙事角度。首次使用规范性多样性指标（代表性、校准和激活）来评估整合框架多样性的新闻推荐系统。

Result: 实验显示，基于媒体框架多样化的方法将用户接触之前未点击框架的比例提高了50%。该方法还增强了类别和情感层面的多样化效果。

Conclusion: 新闻框架作为强大的控制杠杆，能够有效增强规范性多样性。引入新颖框架可以拓宽用户对问题和观点的理解，避免重复接触相同框架可能带来的偏见强化或解释狭窄问题。

Abstract: Click-based news recommender systems suggest users content that aligns with
their existing history, limiting the diversity of articles they encounter.
Recent advances in aspect-based diversification -- adding features such as
sentiments or news categories (e.g. world, politics) -- have made progress
toward diversifying recommendations in terms of perspectives. However, these
approaches often overlook the role of news framing, which shapes how stories
are told by emphasizing specific angles or interpretations. In this paper, we
treat media frames as a controllable aspect within the recommendation pipeline.
By selecting articles based on a diversity of frames, our approach emphasizes
varied narrative angles and broadens the interpretive space recommended to
users. In addition to introducing frame-based diversification method, our work
is the first to assess the impact of a news recommender system that integrates
frame diversity using normative diversity metrics: representation, calibration,
and activation. Our experiments based on media frame diversification show an
improvement in exposure to previously unclicked frames up to 50%. This is
important because repeated exposure to the same frames can reinforce existing
biases or narrow interpretations, whereas introducing novel frames broadens
users' understanding of issues and perspectives. The method also enhances
diversification across categorical and sentiment levels, thereby demonstrating
that framing acts as a strong control lever for enhancing normative diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的查询扩展方法面临性能与计算成本的权衡：生成多样化词汇能提升检索性能但增加计算开销。

Method: CTQE从单次LLM解码过程中提取未选中的候选词，这些词虽非最终输出但包含有用信息，通过聚合这些候选词实现查询扩展。

Result: 实验表明CTQE在显著降低成本和延迟的同时，提供强大的检索性能，优于或可与更昂贵的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CTQE通过巧妙利用LLM解码过程中的候选词，实现了高效且有效的查询扩展，解决了性能与成本之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Query Expansion (QE) improves retrieval performance by enriching queries with
related terms. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used for QE,
but existing methods face a trade-off: generating diverse terms boosts
performance but increases computational cost. To address this challenge, we
propose Candidate Token Query Expansion (CTQE), which extracts diverse and
relevant terms from a single LLM decoding pass by leveraging unselected
candidate tokens. These tokens, though not part of the final output, are
conditioned on the full query and capture useful information. By aggregating
them, CTQE achieves both relevance and diversity without extra inference,
reducing overhead and latency. Experiments show that CTQE delivers strong
retrieval performance with significantly lower cost, outperforming or
comparable to more expensive methods. Code is available at:

Motivation: 探索推理密集型查询的检索效果，建立可复现的基线，并研究重排序对这类查询的影响

Method: 使用稀疏、稠密和融合检索方法，结合LLM列表重排序，在Anserini和Pyserini工具包中集成查询端BM25

Result: 发现BRIGHT的BM25实现与标准方法存在显著差异，特别是在长查询场景下，这种差异对检索结果影响很大

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑BM25方法以适应长查询和检索增强生成等新兴应用，并在主流工具包中集成改进的BM25实现

Abstract: The BRIGHT benchmark is a dataset consisting of reasoning-intensive queries
over diverse domains. We explore retrieval results on BRIGHT using a range of
retrieval techniques, including sparse, dense, and fusion methods, and
establish reproducible baselines. We then apply listwise reranking with large
language models (LLMs) to further investigate the impact of reranking on
reasoning-intensive queries. These baselines are integrated into popular
retrieval and reranking toolkits Anserini, Pyserini, and RankLLM, with
two-click reproducibility that makes them easy to build upon and convenient for
further development. While attempting to reproduce the results reported in the
original BRIGHT paper, we find that the provided BM25 scores differ notably
from those that we obtain using Anserini and Pyserini. We discover that this
difference is due to BRIGHT's implementation of BM25, which applies BM25 on the
query rather than using the standard bag-of-words approach, as in Anserini, to
construct query vectors. This difference has become increasingly relevant due
to the rise of longer queries, with BRIGHT's lengthy reasoning-intensive
queries being a prime example, and further accentuated by the increasing usage
of retrieval-augmented generation, where LLM prompts can grow to be much longer
than ''traditional'' search engine queries. Our observation signifies that it
may be time to reconsider BM25 approaches going forward in order to better
accommodate emerging applications. To facilitate this, we integrate query-side
BM25 into both Anserini and Pyserini.

Result: 新滤波器实现简单高效，仅需先验粒子集和似然函数，可作为经典方法的插件替代

Conclusion: 该方法为高维滤波问题提供了永不退化的解决方案，具有实现简单和计算高效的优点

Abstract: We propose a recursive particle filter for high-dimensional problems that
inherently never degenerates. The state estimate is represented by
deterministic low-discrepancy particle sets. We focus on the measurement update
step, where a likelihood function is used for representing the measurement and
its uncertainty. This likelihood is progressively introduced into the filtering
procedure by homotopy continuation over an artificial time. A generalized
Cram\'er distance between particle sets is derived in closed form that is
differentiable and invariant to particle order. A Newton flow then continually
minimizes this distance over artificial time and thus smoothly moves particles
from prior to posterior density. The new filter is surprisingly simple to
implement and very efficient. It just requires a prior particle set and a
likelihood function, never estimates densities from samples, and can be used as
a plugin replacement for classic approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构造达到Singleton型界的最优(r,δ)-LRCs在分布式存储系统中具有重要应用价值，特别是对于δ≥3的情况，需要开发新的构造方法来获得更灵活的码参数和更长的码长。

Result: 获得了多个显式的最优(r,3)-LRCs和(2,δ)-LRCs族，码长接近q+2√q；构造了最优(4,3)-LRCs，码长接近q+4√q；得到了(g+1-g',g+1+g')-LRCs，码长达q+2g√q；通过超椭圆曲线获得了更长码长和更灵活参数的最优LRCs。

Conclusion: 提出的构造框架成功产生了多个具有灵活最小距离和接近理论极限长度的最优(r,δ)-LRCs，其中许多构造达到了现有方法中已知的最大码长，为分布式存储系统提供了实用的编码方案。

Abstract: Constructing optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs that attain the Singleton-type bound
is an active and important research direction, particularly due to their
practical applications in distributed storage systems. In this paper, we focus
on the construction of optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with flexible minimum
distances, especially for the case $\delta \geq 3$. We first extend a general
framework -- originally proposed by Li \textit{et al.} (IEEE Trans. Inf.
Theory, vol. 65, no. 1, 2019) and Ma and Xing (J. Comb. Theory Ser. A., vol.
193, 2023) -- for constructing optimal $r$-LRCs via automorphism groups of
elliptic function fields to the case of $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. This newly extended
general framework relies on certain conditions concerning the group law of
elliptic curves. By carefully selecting elliptic function fields suitable for
this framework, we arrive at several families of explicit $q$-ary optimal
$(r,3)$-LRCs and $(2,\delta)$-LRCs with lengths slightly less than $q +
2\sqrt{q}$. Next, by employing automorphism groups of hyperelliptic function
fields of genus $2$, we develop a framework for constructing optimal
$(r,3)$-LRCs and obtain a family of explicit $q$-ary optimal $(4,3)$-LRCs with
code lengths slightly below $q+4\sqrt{q}$. We then consider the construction of
optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs via hyperelliptic function fields of arbitrary genus
$g \geq 2$, yielding a class of explicit $q$-ary optimal $(g+1-g',g+1+g')$-LRCs
for $0 \leq g' \leq g-1$ with lengths up to $q + 2g\sqrt{q}$. Finally, applying
certain superelliptic curves derived from modified Norm-Trace curves, we
construct two families of explicit optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with even longer
code lengths and more flexible parameters. Notably, many of the newly
constructed optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs attain the largest known lengths among
existing constructions with flexible minimum distances.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来6G网络提供了更灵活强大的波域控制能力，能够实现近乎在线的自适应配置

Abstract: We propose a complex-valued neural-network (CV-NN) framework to optimally
configure stacked intelligent surfaces (SIS) in next-generation multi-antenna
systems. Unlike conventional solutions that separately tune analog metasurface
phases or rely strictly on SVD-based orthogonal decompositions, our method
models each SIS element as a unit-modulus complex-velued neuron in an
end-to-end differentiable pipeline. This approach avoids enforcing channel
orthogonality and instead allows for richer wavefront designs that can target a
wide range of system objectives, such as maximizing spectral efficiency and
minimizing detection errors, all within a single optimization framework.
Moreover, by exploiting a fully differentiable neural-network formulation and
GPU-based auto-differentiation, our approach can rapidly train SIS
configurations for realistic, high-dimensional channels, enabling near-online
adaptation. Our framework also naturally accommodates hybrid analog-digital
beamforming and recovers classical SVD solutions as a special case. Numerical
evaluations under Rician channels demonstrate that CV-NN SIS optimization
outperforms state-of-the-art schemes in throughput, error performance, and
robustness to channel variation, opening the door to more flexible and powerful
wave-domain control for future 6G networks.

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified
as one of the important components of the sixth-generation (6G) non-terrestrial
networks (NTN) to provide ubiquitous connectivity. Due to the low orbit
altitude and high mobility, a massive number of satellites are required to form
a global continuous coverage constellation, leading to a high construction
cost. To this end, this paper proposes a LEO satellite IoT constellation design
algorithm with the goal of minimizing the total cost while satisfying quality
of service (QoS) requirements in terms of coverage ratio and communication
quality. Specifically, with a novel fitness function and efficient algorithm's
operators, the proposed algorithm converges more quickly and achieves lower
constellation construction cost compared to baseline algorithms under the same
QoS requirements. Theoretical analysis proves the global and fast convergence
of the proposed algorithm due to a novel fitness function. Finally, extensive
simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in LEO
satellite IoT constellation design.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication, which operates at high frequencies,
has gained extensive research interest due to its significantly wide spectrum
and short wavelengths. However, mmWave communication suffers from the notable
drawbacks as follows: i) The mmWave signals are sensitive to the blockage,
which is caused by the weak diffraction ability of mmWave propagation; ii) Even
though the introduction of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can
overcome the performance degradation caused by serve path loss, the location of
users and RISs as well as their densities incur a significant impact on the
coverage and rate performance; iii) When the RISs' density is very high, i.e.,
the network becomes extremely dense, a user sees several line-of-sight RISs and
thus experiences significant interference, which degrades the system
performance. Motivated by the challenges above, we first analyze distributed
multi-RISaided mmWave communication system over Nakagami-m fading from the
stochastic geometry perspective. To be specific, we analyze the end-to-end
(E2E) signal-to-interference-plus-noiseratio (SINR) coverage and rate
performance of the system. To improve the system performance in terms of the
E2E SINR coverage probability and rate, we study the optimization of the
phase-shifting control of the distributed RISs and optimize the E2E SINR
coverage particularly when deploying a large number of reflecting elements in
RISs. To facilitate the study, we optimize the dynamic association criterion
between the RIS and destination. Furthermore, we optimize the multi-RIS-user
association based on the physical distances between the RISs and destination by
exploiting the maximum-ratio transmission.

Abstract: The broadcast nature of wireless communication renders it inherently
vulnerable to security threats such as jamming and eavesdropping. While
traditional array beamforming techniques help to mitigate these threats, they
usually incur high hardware and processing costs, particularly in large-scale
arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs). In contrast, movable antenna (MA)
arrays can fully exploit the channel variation in spatial regions by enabling
flexible antenna movement, which has emerged as a promising technology for
secure communications. This article provides a magazine-type overview of
MA-aided secure communications. Specifically, we first illuminate the promising
application scenarios for MA-enhanced secure communication systems. Then, we
examine the security advantages of MAs over conventional FPA systems,
fundamentally stemming from their ability to adjust channel correlations
between legitimate users, eavesdroppers, and jammers. Furthermore, we discuss
important technical challenges and their potential solutions related to MA
hardware architecture, channel acquisition, and antenna position optimization
to realize secure transmissions. Finally, several promising directions for
MA-aided secure communications are presented to inspire future research.

Abstract: This paper investigates movable antenna (MA) empowered secure transmission in
near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, where
the base station (BS) equipped with an MA array transmits confidential
information to a legitimate user under the threat of a potential eavesdropper.
To enhance physical layer security (PLS) of the considered system, we aim to
maximize the secrecy rate by jointly designing the hybrid digital and analog
beamformers, as well as the positions of MAs at the BS. To solve the formulated
non-convex problem with highly coupled variables, an alternating optimization
(AO)-based algorithm is introduced by decoupling the original problem into two
separate subproblems. Specifically, for the subproblem of designing hybrid
beamformers, a semi-closed-form solution for the fully-digital beamformer is
first derived by a weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm.
Subsequently, the digital and analog beamformers are determined by
approximating the fully-digital beamformer through the manifold optimization
(MO) technique. For the MA positions design subproblem, we utilize the
majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm to iteratively optimize each MA's
position while keeping others fixed. Extensive simulation results validate the
considerable benefits of the proposed MA-aided near-field beam focusing
approach in enhancing security performance compared to the traditional
far-field and/or the fixed position antenna (FPA)-based systems. In addition,
the proposed scheme can realize secure transmission even if the eavesdropper is
located in the same direction as the user and closer to the BS.

### [251] [Maximum a Posteriori Probability (MAP) Joint Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) and Channel Estimation for MIMO Channels with Spatial and Temporal Correlations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01032)
*Ibrahim Khalife,Ali Abbasi,Zhe Feng,Mingda Zhou,Xinming Huang,Youjian Liu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文针对时变MIMO衰落信道，提出了联合载波频率偏移(CFO)和信道估计的MAP方法，证明了其等效性，并扩展了低复杂度通用CFO估计算法，分析了时间相关性对估计性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时变MIMO信道中已知时空相关性的联合CFO和信道估计问题，利用先验分布提高估计精度，特别是利用前一个数据包的估计结果。

Method: 采用最大后验概率(MAP)联合估计方法，证明其等价于先MAP估计CFO再MMSE估计信道的分离过程。扩展了时不变情况下的通用CFO估计算法到时变情况，无需相位解缠绕。

Result: 提出的通用算法在几乎所有SNR范围内都能达到贝叶斯克拉美罗下界(BCRLB)，发现BCRLB不是时间相关性的单调函数，且受导频信号结构强烈影响。通过简单重排导频矩阵的0和1可以改变BCRLB的单调性。

Conclusion: 所提算法实现了BCRLB，为导频信号设计提供了指导，揭示了时间相关性、CFO估计性能和导频结构之间的重要关系，对实际系统设计具有重要价值。

Abstract: We consider time varying MIMO fading channels with known spatial and temporal
correlation and solve the problem of joint carrier frequency offset (CFO) and
channel estimation with prior distributions. The maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) joint estimation is proved to be equivalent to a separate MAP
estimation of the CFO followed by minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation
of the channel while treating the estimated CFO as true. The MAP solution is
useful to take advantage of the estimates from the previous data packet. A low
complexity universal CFO estimation algorithm is extended from the time
invariant case to the time varying case. Unlike past algorithms, the universal
algorithm does not need phase unwrapping to take advantage of the full range of
symbol correlation and achieves the derived Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao lower bound
(BCRLB) in almost all SNR range. We provide insight on the the relation among
the temporal correlation coefficient of the fading, the CFO estimation
performance, and the pilot signal structure. An unexpected observation is that
the BCRLB is not a monotone function of the temporal correlation and is
strongly influenced by the pilot signal structures. A simple rearrangement of
the 0's and 1's in the pilot signal matrix will render the BCRLB from being
non-monotone to being monotone in certain temporal correlation ranges. Since
the BCRLB is shown to be achieved by the proposed algorithm, it provides a
guideline for pilot signal design.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: DSK（方向偏移键控）通过将信息编码在到达方向上而非幅度或相位，显著延长了毫米波和太赫兹系统的相干时间，并天然抵消相位噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决毫米波和太赫兹系统中无线信道快速变化和相位噪声问题，传统方法需要密集导频插入，DSK通过方向编码提供更优解决方案。

Method: 推导M天线移动设备的最优检测器结构，建立方向相干时间(DCT)理论模型，分析DCT与距离/速度的关系，证明相位噪声天然抵消特性。

Result: 理论分析显示DCT与d/v成正比，而传统CCT与λ/v成正比，获得d/λ量级的相干时间增益（超过4个数量级），DSK天然消除相位噪声无需补偿。

Conclusion: DSK在高频移动环境中具有优异的鲁棒性和可扩展性，通过方向编码显著延长相干时间并消除相位噪声，为毫米波和太赫兹通信提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid variation of the wireless channel (short channel coherence time)
and the phase noise are two prominent concerns in Millimeter-wave (mmWave) and
sub-Terahertz systems communication systems. Equalizing the channel effect and
tracking the phase noise necessitate dense pilot insertion. Direction-Shift
Keying (DSK), a recent variant of Spatial Modulation (SM), addresses these
challenges by encoding information in the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) using a
distributed antenna system (DAS), rather than relying on amplitude or phase.
DSK has been shown to extend coherence time by up to four orders of magnitude.
Despite its promise, existing DSK studies are largely simulation-based and
limited to simplified roadside unit scenarios and mobile device (MD) equipped
with only two antennas. DSK's performance in general settings, along with the
fundamental laws governing its behavior, such as coherence time and resilience
to phase noise, remain open problems. In this paper, we derive the structure of
the optimal detector for the case of $M$-antenna MD. Then, we establish the
governing law for DSK's coherence time, termed the Direction Coherence Time
(DCT), defining the the temporal duration over which the DoA remains
approximately invariant. We analytically establish that DCT scales with $d/v$
(transmitter-receiver distance over velocity), while the Channel Coherence Time
(CCT) scales with $\lambda/v$, revealing a coherence time gain on the order of
$d/\lambda$ (equivalent to more than four orders of magnitude.) Furthermore, we
prove that DSK inherently cancels the phase noise, requiring no additional
compensation. Analytical predictions are validated through simulations,
confirming the robustness and scalability of DSK in high-frequency mobile
environments.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种构建二维有界权重约束编码的通用框架，确保每行每列中1的数量不超过给定函数f(n)，当f(n)=ω(log n)时能够实现容量逼近的二维编码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ReRAM等存储技术的发展，需要将信息数据视为二维而非一维，但二维约束编码的研究相对较少，特别是在保证每行每列都满足一维约束条件下的高效二维编码构造是一个挑战

Method: 提出了一个通用框架来设计二维编码，确保长度为n的每行每列权重最多为任意给定函数f(n)。该方法利用现有的一维容量逼近编码设计来构建相应的二维编码

Conclusion: 该工作为解决二进制有界权重约束编码的二维编码构造问题提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于权重约束函数f(n)=ω(log n)的情况

Abstract: Recent developments in storage- especially in the area of resistive random
access memory (ReRAM)- are attempting to scale the storage density by regarding
the information data as two-dimensional (2D), instead of one-dimensional (1D).
Correspondingly, new types of 2D constraints are introduced into the input
information data to improve the system reliability. While 1D constraints have
been extensively investigated in the literature, the study for 2D constraints
is much less profound. Particularly, given a constraint $\mathcal{F}$ and a
design of 1D codes whose codewords satisfy $\mathcal{F}$, the problem of
constructing efficient 2D codes, such that every row and every column in every
codeword satisfy $\mathcal{F}$, has been a challenge. This work provides an
efficient solution to the challenging coding problem above for the binary
bounded-weight constrained codes that restrict the maximum number of $1$'s
(called {\em weight}). Formally, we propose a universal framework to design 2D
codes that guarantee the weight of every row and every column of length $n$ to
be at most $f(n)$ for any given function $f(n)$. We show that if there exists a
design of capacity-approaching 1D codes, then our method also provides
capacity-approaching 2D codes for all $f=\omega(\log n)$.

Conclusion: 分层最大熵框架成功连接了概率论、信息论和统计力学，为多层级模型提供了统一的变分原理和计算方法

Abstract: Hierarchical structures, which include multiple levels, are prevalent in
statistical and machine-learning models as well as physical systems. Extending
the foundational result that the maximum entropy distribution under mean
constraints is given by the exponential Gibbs-Boltzmann form, we introduce the
framework of "hierarchical maximum entropy" to address these multilevel models.
We demonstrate that Pareto optimal distributions, which maximize entropies
across all levels of hierarchical transformations, can be obtained via
renormalization-group procedures from theoretical physics. This is achieved by
formulating multilevel extensions of the Gibbs variational principle and the
Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of entropy. Moreover, we explore
settings with hierarchical invariances that significantly simplify the
renormalization-group procedures, enhancing computational efficiency: quadratic
modular loss functions, logarithmic loss functions, and nearest-neighbor loss
functions. This is accomplished through the introduction of the concept of
parameter flows, which serves as an analog to renormalization flows in
renormalization group theory. This work connects ideas from probability theory,
information theory, and statistical mechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定量组测试(QGT)中，信息理论表明自适应方法可能将查询次数减少一半，但现有算法尚未突破非自适应界限，自适应方法的实际效益仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 将QGT问题转化为维度与稀疏性相关的整数向量恢复任务，然后将其建模为离线强化学习问题，使用决策变换器进行自适应求解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法首次实现了平均查询次数低于著名的非自适应信息理论界限，证明了自适应方法确实可以减少查询次数。

Conclusion: 通过结合维度缩减和决策变换器的自适应方法，成功证明了自适应性在定量组测试中可以有效减少所需查询数量，解决了长期存在的开放问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative group testing (QGT), where the goal
is to recover a sparse binary vector from aggregate subset-sum queries: each
query selects a subset of indices and returns the sum of those entries.
Information-theoretic results suggest that adaptivity could yield up to a
twofold reduction in the total number of required queries, yet no algorithm has
surpassed the non-adaptive bound, leaving its practical benefit an open
question. In this paper, we reduce the QGT problem to an integer-vector
recovery task whose dimension scales with the sparsity of the original problem
rather than its full ambient size. We then formulate this reduced recovery task
as an offline reinforcement learning problem and employ Decision Transformers
to solve it adaptively. By combining these two steps, we obtain an effective
end-to-end method for solving the QGT problem. Our experiments show that, for
the first time in the literature, our adaptive algorithm reduces the average
number of queries below the well-known non-adaptive information-theoretic
bound, demonstrating that adaptivity can indeed reduce the number of queries.

Abstract: Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) can dramatically reduce the queuing
delay of block codes in real-time services. In this paper, we aim to explore
the fundamental limit of large-field-size RLSCs in stochastic symbol erasure
channels (SEC). The Non-systematic RLSCs (NRLSCs) in i.i.d. SEC has been
analyzed in [Pinwen Su et al. 2022]. In this work, we first derive the
closed-form expression on the exact error probability of NRLSCs in
Gilbert-Elliott symbol erasure channels (G-ESEC). Compared to i.i.d SEC, the
erasure probability of G-ESEC depends on channel state, thus transitions
between the states should be considered. To deal with the stochastic state
transitions, we introduce two novel techniques. (i) To account for the impact
of switching states on probability terms, we find and leverage the recursive
structure of the state transition traces. (ii) To obtain the expected number of
error timeslots, we derive the stationary initial distribution of the states,
and formulate iterative equation to characterize the expectation terms. Then we
analyze the Systematic RLSCs (SRLSCs) in a special SEC, i.e., the packet
erasure channel (PEC). In this scenario, SRLSCs could save some source symbols
which should have exceeded the decoding delay in NRLSCs, and thus could
significantly reduce the error probability. To this point, our contributions
are two-folds. (i) Through a case study, we find a counter-intuitive phenomenon
that SRLSCs can cause unexpected error events comparing to NRLSCs in some
erasure patterns. Then we fully characterize the error event of SRLSCs for any
erasure pattern. (ii) For i.i.d. PEC, we derive an analytical expression on
exact error probability of SRLSCs when length of memory approaches infinity and
coding rate equals to 1/2. Simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of
our analysis and compare the performance of NRLSCs, SRLSCs, and existing
streaming codes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models (FMs) have attracted increasing
attention in the wireless communication domain. Leveraging the powerful
multi-task learning capability, FMs hold the promise of unifying multiple tasks
of wireless communication with a single framework. with a single framework.
Nevertheless, existing wireless FMs face limitations in the uniformity to
address multiple tasks with diverse inputs/outputs across different
communication scenarios.In this paper, we propose a MUlti-taSk
Environment-aware FM (MUSE-FM) with a unified architecture to handle multiple
tasks in wireless communications, while effectively incorporating scenario
information.Specifically, to achieve task uniformity, we propose a unified
prompt-guided data encoder-decoder pair to handle data with heterogeneous
formats and distributions across different tasks. Besides, we integrate the
environmental context as a multi-modal input, which serves as prior knowledge
of environment and channel distributions and facilitates cross-scenario feature
extraction. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed MUSE-FM outperforms
existing methods for various tasks, and its prompt-guided encoder-decoder pair
improves the scalability for new task configurations. Moreover, the
incorporation of environment information improves the ability to adapt to
different scenarios.

Abstract: Aligning with the global mandates pushing towards advanced technologies with
reduced resource consumption and environmental impacts, the sustainability of
wireless networks becomes a significant concern in 6G systems. To address this
concern, a native integration of sustainability into the operations of
next-generation networks through novel designs and metrics is necessary.
Nevertheless, existing wireless sustainability efforts remain limited to
energy-efficient network designs which fail to capture the environmental impact
of such systems. In this paper, a novel sustainability metric is proposed that
captures emissions per bit, providing a rigorous measure of the environmental
foot- print associated with energy consumption in 6G networks. This metric also
captures how energy, computing, and communication resource parameters influence
the reduction of emissions per bit. Then, the problem of allocating the energy,
computing and communication resources is posed as a multi-objective (MO)
optimization problem. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, our framework
leverages MO reinforcement learning (MORL) to maximize the novel sustainability
metric alongside minimizing energy consumption and average delays in
successfully delivering the data, all while adhering to constraints on energy
resource capacity. The proposed MORL methodology computes a global policy that
achieves a Pareto-optimal tradeoff among multiple objectives, thereby balancing
environmental sustainability with network performance. Simulation results show
that the proposed approach reduces the average emissions per bit by around 26%
compared to state-of-the-art methods that do not explicitly integrate carbon
emissions into their control objectives.

TL;DR: 研究上行链路振子天线系统的实用通道估计方法，分析了两种天线激活协议（串行和并行）在理想和实际损耗模型下的性能差异，以及上下行链路通道估计的对称性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决振子天线系统中实际通道估计的挑战，包括双向功率分配、累积功率泄漏和波导衰减等物理现象对估计性能的影响。

Method: 提出了基于电磁兼容波导传输模型的两种天线激活协议：一个一激活的串行协议和使用二进制S矩阵的并行协议。对比分析了这两种方法在数值稳定性、数组增益和结构串话等方面的性能差异。

Result: 数值结果显示：1）在理想无损耗模型中，并行协议因具有同时收集能量的数组增益而更优；2）在实际有损耗模型中，串行协议因避免累积泄漏导致的数值不稳定性而更优；3）下行链路估计适合使用串行协议，而上行链路估计适合使用并行协议。

Conclusion: 串行协议具有更好的数值稳定性，而并行协议能够获得数组增益。在实际应用中，需要根据具体的物理损耗情况和上下行链路特性选择适宜的天线激活协议，以在数值稳定性和数组增益之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The practical channel estimation in uplink pinching-antenna systems is
investigated, in which an electromagnetic-compliant in-waveguide transmission
model is exhibited, incorporating both bidirectional power splitting,
cumulative power leakage, and waveguide attenuation. Based on this model, the
paper investigates two antenna activation protocols for channel estimation: a
serial protocol based on one-by-one antenna activation and a parallel protocol
utilizing a binary S-Matrix activation. The serial protocol is characterized by
its superior numerical stability but a lack of array gain, whereas the parallel
protocol theoretically offers array gain but suffers from severe performance
degradation due to structural crosstalk from the non-orthogonal S-Matrix and
ill-conditioning from cumulative leakage. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the
fundamental commonalities and asymmetries between uplink and downlink channel
estimation in pinching-antenna systems. Numerical results demonstrate that 1)
in an ideal lossless model, the parallel protocol is superior to the serial
protocol due to the array gain from simultaneous energy collection in uplink
transmission; 2) in a practical model with physical losses, the serial protocol
outperforms the parallel protocol, as the performance of the parallel protocol
is degraded by the numerical instability from cumulative leakage, which
outweighs the benefit of array gain; 3) For downlink channel estimation, the
serial protocol is more suitable because it avoids bidirectional power
splitting, while the parallel protocol is more suitable for the uplink as it
can make full use of array gain.

Abstract: Device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the most promising techniques
for future wireless cellular communication systems. This paper considers coded
caching in a partially cooperative wireless D2D network, where only a subset of
users transmit during delivery, while all users request files. The
non-transmitting users are referred to as selfish users. All existing schemes
that do not require knowledge of the identity of selfish users before content
placement are limited to the high-memory regime, particularly when the number
of selfish users is large. We propose a novel coded caching scheme for a
partially cooperative D2D network that operates in all feasible memory regimes,
regardless of the number of selfish users. We also derive a lower bound on the
transmission load of a partially cooperative D2D coded caching scheme. Using
this bound, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the high-memory
regime.

formalize a new class of zero-sum symmetric Markov games, which extends the
notion of symmetry from matrix games to the Markovian setting. We show that
even without observing payoffs, a player who knows the transition dynamics and
observes only the opponents sequence of actions can still compete against an
adversary who may have complete knowledge of the game. We formalize three
distinct notions of symmetry in this setting and show that, under these
conditions, the learning problem can be reduced to an instance of online
learning, enabling the player to asymptotically match the return of the
opponent despite lacking payoff observations. Our algorithms apply to both
matrix and Markov games, and run in polynomial time with respect to the size of
the game and the number of episodes. Our work broadens the class of games in
which robust learning is possible under severe informational disadvantage and
deepens the connection between online learning and adversarial game theory.

### [263] [Strategyproof Mechanisms for Facility Location with Prediction Under the Maximum Cost Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00439)
*Hau Chan,Jianan Lin,Chenhao Wang*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究在度量空间上的设施选址机制设计问题，采用学习增强框架，利用不完美的预测来设计策略证明机制，在保证最坏情况性能的同时，当预测准确时获得更好的近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统设施选址机制设计缺乏对预测信息的利用，而实际应用中往往可以获得不完美的预测。研究如何结合预测信息设计机制，在预测准确时获得更好性能，同时在预测错误时仍保持鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了MinMaxP机制：当预测位置位于两个极端代理位置之间时返回预测位置，否则返回最接近预测的代理位置。在二维空间中使用坐标独立的MinMaxP机制和随机化机制。

Result: 在实数线上，MinMaxP机制达到(1+min(1,η))-近似，且没有确定性SP机制能获得更好的近似保证。在二维lp度量空间中分析了相应机制的近似性能。

Conclusion: MinMaxP机制在利用预测信息方面达到了最优性能，为学习增强的设施选址机制设计提供了理论基础，并讨论了机制的群组策略证明性质。

Abstract: We study the mechanism design problem of facility location on a metric space
in the learning-augmented framework, where mechanisms have access to an
imperfect prediction of optimal facility locations. Our goal is to design
strategyproof (SP) mechanisms to elicit agent preferences on the facility
locations truthfully and, leveraging the given imperfect prediction, determine
the facility location that approximately minimizes the maximum cost among all
agents. In particular, we seek SP mechanisms whose approximation guarantees
depend on the prediction errors -- achieve improved guarantees when the
prediction is accurate (known as the \emph{consistency}), while still ensuring
robust worst-case performance when the prediction is arbitrarily inaccurate
(known as the \emph{robustness}).
  When the metric space is the real line, we characterize all deterministic SP
mechanisms with consistency strictly less than 2 and bounded robustness: such
mechanisms must be the MinMaxP mechanism, which returns the prediction location
if it lies between the two extreme agent locations and, otherwise, returns the
closest agent location to the prediction. We further show that, for any
prediction error $\eta\ge 0$, while MinMaxP is $(1+\min(1,
\eta))$-approximation, no deterministic SP mechanism can achieve a better
approximation. In two-dimensional spaces with the $l_p$ metric, we analyze the
approximation guarantees of a deterministic mechanism that runs MinMaxP
independently on each coordinate, as well as a randomized mechanism that
selects between two deterministic ones with specific probabilities. Finally, we
discuss the group strategyproofness of the considered mechanisms.

*Guy Avni,Suman Sadhukhan*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了离散竞价博弈中的均值收益和能量目标，建立了阈值预算的存在性，并证明了阈值计算在NP和coNP复杂度类中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散竞价博弈具有实际应用价值（如投标必须以分为单位），而此前对连续竞价博弈已有深入研究，但对离散竞价博弈的均值收益和能量目标研究尚属空白。

Method: 研究离散竞价博弈模型，玩家在图上通过竞价移动令牌，分析均值收益和能量目标下的阈值预算特性。

Result: 证明了离散竞价博弈中阈值预算的存在性，揭示了阈值的结构特征，并证明即使在简洁表示的博弈中，阈值计算问题也在NP和coNP复杂度类中。

Conclusion: 离散竞价博弈具有与连续竞价博弈不同的数学特性，阈值预算的存在性和可计算性为实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: A \emph{bidding} game is played on a graph as follows. A token is placed on
an initial vertex and both players are allocated budgets. In each turn, the
players simultaneously submit bids that do not exceed their available budgets,
the higher bidder moves the token, and pays the bid to the lower bidder. We
focus on \emph{discrete}-bidding, which are motivated by practical applications
and restrict the granularity of the players' bids, e.g, bids must be given in
cents. We study, for the first time, discrete-bidding games with {\em
mean-payoff} and {\em energy} objectives. In contrast, mean-payoff {\em
continuous}-bidding games (i.e., no granularity restrictions) are understood
and exhibit a rich mathematical structure. The {\em threshold} budget is a
necessary and sufficient initial budget for winning an energy game or
guaranteeing a target payoff in a mean-payoff game. We first establish
existence of threshold budgets; a non-trivial property due to the concurrent
moves of the players. Moreover, we identify the structure of the thresholds,
which is key in obtaining compact strategies, and in turn, showing that finding
threshold is in \NP~and \coNP even in succinctly-represented games.

*Karim Essalmi,Fernando Garrido,Fawzi Nashashibi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出两种量子博弈模型QG-U1和QG-G4，用于自动驾驶中的交互感知决策，通过量子力学原理改进传统博弈论方法，在合并和环岛场景中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶决策方法往往忽视或过度简化车辆间的交互，导致自我车辆行为过于保守，需要新的方法来更好地建模和解决这些复杂交互问题。

Method: 开发了两种量子博弈模型：QG-U1（量子博弈-酉矩阵1）和QG-G4（量子博弈-门4），基于量子力学原理（叠加、干涉、纠缠）扩展经典博弈论，适用于双玩家双策略游戏，可在标准计算机上实时运行。

Result: 在合并和环岛场景测试中，QG-G4相比基线方法（IDM、MOBIL、基于效用的技术）实现了更低的碰撞率和更高的成功率，两种量子模型在特定参数设置下都比经典博弈方法获得更高的期望收益。

Conclusion: 量子博弈模型为自动驾驶交互决策提供了有效的新方法，能够在不需要量子硬件的情况下实现更好的性能表现，特别是在复杂交通场景中展现出优势。

Abstract: Decision-making in automated driving must consider interactions with
surrounding agents to be effective. However, traditional methods often neglect
or oversimplify these interactions because they are difficult to model and
solve, which can lead to overly conservative behavior of the ego vehicle. To
address this gap, we propose two quantum game models, QG-U1 (Quantum Game -
Unitary 1) and QG-G4 (Quantum Game - Gates 4), for interaction-aware
decision-making. These models extend classical game theory by incorporating
principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition, interference, and
entanglement. Specifically, QG-U1 and QG-G4 are designed for two-player games
with two strategies per player and can be executed in real time on a standard
computer without requiring quantum hardware. We evaluate both models in merging
and roundabout scenarios and compare them with classical game-theoretic methods
and baseline approaches (IDM, MOBIL, and a utility-based technique). Results
show that QG-G4 achieves lower collision rates and higher success rates
compared to baseline methods, while both quantum models yield higher expected
payoffs than classical game approaches under certain parameter settings.

Motivation: 安全均衡是纳什均衡的一个有前景的细化概念，在这种均衡中玩家不仅关注自身收益，还关注其他玩家的收益变化。研究其存在性判定问题对多玩家博弈理论具有重要意义

Method: 基于有限有向图上的多玩家非零和回合制博弈模型，分析安全均衡的约束条件（指定哪些玩家必须获胜），研究该问题的可判定性和计算复杂度

Result: 论文讨论了在给定多玩家游戏中，存在满足特定约束条件的安全均衡这一判定问题的可判定性和复杂度特性

Conclusion: 安全均衡作为纳什均衡的细化概念，在多玩家博弈中具有重要理论价值，其存在性判定问题的可判定性和复杂度分析为相关算法设计提供了理论基础

Abstract: We consider a multi-player non-zero-sum turn-based game (abbreviated as
multi-player game) on a finite directed graph. A secure equilibrium (SE) is a
strategy profile in which no player has the incentive to deviate from the
strategy because no player can increase her own payoff or lower the payoff of
another player. SE is a promising refinement of Nash equilibrium in which a
player does not care the payoff of another player. In this paper, we discuss
the decidability and complexity of the problem of deciding whether a secure
equilibrium with constraints (a payoff profile specifying which players must
win) exists for a given multi-player game.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台低质量内容泛滥的主要原因是缺乏有效的进入门槛，研究旨在探索通过隐式或显式进入壁垒配合奖励机制来提升内容质量。

Method: 采用博弈论分析方法，研究两种进入壁垒：1）结构性壁垒（现有内容提供者的集体行为形成）2）战略性壁垒（平台主动设置进入费用）。分析不同奖励机制（排名奖励和比例分享奖励）下的纳什均衡。

Result: 研究发现两种奖励机制都会在纳什均衡下产生结构性壁垒；平台通过设置进入费用并将部分或全部费用转入奖励池的战略性壁垒方法，能够有效提升整体内容质量。

Conclusion: 研究为设计结合进入费用的奖励机制提供了理论基础，有助于促进更高质量内容和更健康的在线生态系统。

Abstract: The prevalence of low-quality content on online platforms is often attributed
to the absence of meaningful entry requirements. This motivates us to
investigate whether implicit or explicit entry barriers, alongside appropriate
reward mechanisms, can enhance content quality. We present the first
game-theoretic analysis of two distinct types of entry barriers in online
content platforms. The first, a structural barrier, emerges from the collective
behaviour of incumbent content providers which disadvantages new entrants. We
show that both rank-order and proportional-share reward mechanisms induce such
a structural barrier at Nash equilibrium. The second, a strategic barrier,
involves the platform proactively imposing entry fees to discourage
participation from low-quality contributors. We consider a scheme in which the
platform redirects some or all of the entry fees into the reward pool. We
formally demonstrate that this approach can improve overall content quality.
Our findings establish a theoretical foundation for designing reward mechanisms
coupled with entry fees to promote higher-quality content and support healthier
online ecosystems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了第一个组合且强多项式时间算法来计算凸博弈中的核仁，推翻了之前关于简化博弈多项式时间实现的错误主张，并通过开发新算法思想和利用最小核多面体结构实现了有效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核仁是合作博弈论中的基本解概念，但一般情况下的计算是NP难的。在凸博弈中，现有的唯一多项式时间算法依赖于椭球法，需要更高效的组合算法。

Method: 重新审视简化博弈方法，开发新的算法思想，利用最小核多面体的结构特性，构建组合算法框架。

Result: 成功实现了第一个组合且强多项式时间算法，能够有效计算凸博弈中的核仁，解决了之前方法失败的问题。

Conclusion: 通过创新的算法设计和结构分析，证明了简化博弈方法在凸博弈核仁计算中的有效性，为这一经典问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The nucleolus is a fundamental solution concept in cooperative game theory,
yet computing it is NP-hard in general. In convex games-where players' marginal
contributions grow with coalition size-the only existing polynomial-time
algorithm relies on the ellipsoid method. We re-examine a reduced game
approach, refuting a previously claimed polynomial-time implementation and
clarifying why it fails. By developing new algorithmic ideas and exploiting the
structure of least core polyhedra, we show that reduced games can in fact be
used effectively. This yields the first combinatorial and strongly polynomial
algorithm for computing the nucleolus in convex games.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激励机制设计中，委托人面临具有信息优势的代理人时会产生信息租金，需要系统研究信息不对称的影响并寻找缓解方法

Method: 在矩阵博弈和二次高斯博弈框架下，研究委托人通过让代理人塑造信念（信息设计）或付费获取信息来减少信息不对称

Result: 不确定性增加委托人成本，但让代理人塑造信念可能对委托人有利

Conclusion: 委托人应主动减少信息不对称，信息设计是一种有效的策略，可以在某些情况下为委托人带来优势

Abstract: Incentive design deals with interaction between a principal and an agent
where the former can shape the latter's utility through a policy commitment. It
is well known that the principal faces an information rent when dealing with an
agent that has informational advantage. In this work, we embark on a systematic
study of the effect of information asymmetry in incentive design games.
Specifically, we first demonstrate that it is in principal's interest to
decrease this information asymmetry. To mitigate this uncertainty, we let the
principal gather information either by letting the agent shape her belief (aka
Information Design), or by paying to acquire it. Providing solutions to all
these cases we show that while introduction of uncertainty increases the
principal's cost, letting the agent shape its belief can be advantageous. We
study information asymmetry and information acquisition in both matrix games
and quadratic Gaussian game setups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极化是影响社会良好运作的主要问题，通常由极化的政治代表推动，即使这种情况本可以轻易避免。现有的计算社会选择方法未能解决这一问题。

Method: 定义了两种量化指标来评估委员会如何连接选民，最大化这些指标以避免极化委员会。针对选民-候选人区间域设计了高效算法，并分析了与其他代表性目标的兼容性。

Result: 虽然最大化问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但在选民-候选人区间域中获得了高效算法。识别了近似保证之间的权衡，并设计了能同时实现常数因子近似的算法。

Conclusion: 通过量化指标和高效算法，该方法能够有效避免委员会极化，同时与其他代表性目标保持兼容，为构建更加连接和包容的政治代表体系提供了计算工具。

Abstract: Polarization is a major concern for a well-functioning society. Often, mass
polarization of a society is driven by polarizing political representation,
even when the latter is easily preventable. The existing computational social
choice methods for the task of committee selection are not designed to address
this issue. We enrich the standard approach to committee selection by defining
two quantitative measures that evaluate how well a given committee
interconnects the voters. Maximizing these measures aims at avoiding polarizing
committees. While the corresponding maximization problems are NP-complete in
general, we obtain efficient algorithms for profiles in the voter-candidate
interval domain. Moreover, we analyze the compatibility of our goals with other
representation objectives, such as excellence, diversity, and proportionality.
We identify trade-offs between approximation guarantees, and describe
algorithms that achieve simultaneous constant-factor approximations.

Motivation: 虽然口吃检测模型的性能在指标数据集上不断提升，但临床应用需要模型具备可控制性和可解释性，因此需要对不同方法进行系统性评估。

Method: 采用系统性比较分析方法，在多个数据集上对四种代表性模型(YOLO-Stutter、FluentNet、UDM、SSDM)进行综合评估，包括性能、可控制性和可解释性三个维度，并结合专业临床医生的评估。

Result: YOLO-Stutter和FluentNet提供效率和简洁性，但透明度有限；UDM在准确性和临床可解释性方面达到最佳平衡；SSDM虽有潜力但在实验中无法完全复现。

Conclusion: 研究强调了不同口吃检测方法之间的权衡关系，指明了临床可行性的未来研究方向，并为每种方法提供了详细的实现见解和实际部署考虑。

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling
paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks
(YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on
benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than
accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we
present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative
approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions:
performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive
evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that
YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited
transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical
interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in
our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing
approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency
modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical
deployment considerations for each approach.

Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether
static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an
empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize
research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal
structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge
cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model
represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643
multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified
over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates.
Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near
knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release
dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal
studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly
retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step
reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that
goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation
strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and
dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that
prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply
collecting newly released questions periodically.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher
cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight,
test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted
refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$
alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum
token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use
entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report
(tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide
corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning,
mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches
95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the
cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while
improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We
demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle
ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it
practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究通过赋予不同准确度的情感分类器来探索感知准确性对情感和空间行为的影响，发现低准确度分类器会导致信任减少、情感分裂和社会组织混乱，而高准确度则能形成稳定的情感集群和抗干扰能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索情感感知准确性如何影响社会行为，特别是当个体基于感知而非真实情感做出反应时，系统性的误判和挫败感对社会互动的破坏作用。

Method: 在2D环面网格上创建代理，使用KDEF人脸照片作为视觉表示，赋予基于JAFFE（低）、CK+（中）、KDEF（高）数据集训练的情感分类器。代理根据感知到的邻居情感状态移动（趋近积极情绪，避开消极情绪）。

Result: 低准确度分类器导致信任减少、情感分裂为悲伤、社会组织混乱；高准确度分类器形成稳定的情感集群和情绪干扰恢复能力；即使在情感中性场景中，误判也足以产生隔离和凝聚力瓦解。

Conclusion: 情感识别中的偏见或不精确可能显著扭曲社会过程并破坏情感整合，强调了准确情感感知对社会互动的重要性。

Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is
fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated
with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual
accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually
represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of
three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high)
datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving
neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with
movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative
emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth,
emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of
experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and
scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy
classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust,
emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By
contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional
clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral
scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration
of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in
emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt
emotional integration.

Motivation: 全模态大语言模型存在幻觉问题，文本先验主导导致模型过度依赖文本线索而忽视视觉和音频信息，同时现有模型在训练时独立对齐各模态而忽略了视频与音频的内在关联。

Method: 提出OmniDPO框架，包含两种策略：(1)构建文本偏好样本对增强音频-视频交互理解；(2)构建多模态偏好样本对强化对视觉和听觉信息的关注。

Result: 在两个全模态大语言模型上的实验表明，OmniDPO不仅有效减轻多模态幻觉，还显著提升了跨模态推理能力。

Conclusion: OmniDPO通过偏好对齐策略成功解决了全模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，提高了多模态基础能力和推理性能。

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of
research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video
understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination
issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text
modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues
while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal
scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or
auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the
intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This
oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden
audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations
in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing
text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of
audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample
pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information.
By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding
and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that
OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also
significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.
All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

*Rahul Anand*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MODE是一种轻量级的检索增强生成方法，用聚类路由检索替代精细的最近邻搜索，在小型领域特定语料库上实现高效检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖大型向量数据库和跨编码器，对于小型领域特定语料库来说过于复杂和冗余，需要更轻量级的解决方案

Method: 将文档嵌入后分组到语义连贯的聚类中，用缓存质心表示。查询时路由到顶部质心，仅在这些聚类内检索上下文，无需外部向量数据库基础设施和重排序

Result: 在100-500个文本块的HotpotQA和SQuAD语料库上，MODE在答案质量上匹配或超过密集检索基线，同时减少端到端检索时间

Conclusion: MODE为中小型语料库提供了实用的解决方案，在简单性、速度和主题聚焦方面具有优势，聚类粒度和多聚类路由控制召回/精确度权衡

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases
and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for
small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document
Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor
search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into
semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query
time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those
clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking
while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,
MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while
reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and
multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter
clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small
and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AMDM算法，通过多维度监控和异常检测来改进AI系统的评估，在模拟实验中显著降低了检测延迟和误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI系统评估过于依赖技术指标，缺乏对人类中心和经济维度的考量，需要更全面的监控框架来确保AI系统在真实世界中的安全部署。

Method: 提出自适应多维度监控(AMDM)算法，包括异质指标归一化、按轴指数加权移动平均阈值设置，以及基于马氏距离的联合异常检测。

Result: AMDM算法在模拟实验中使异常检测延迟从12.3秒降至5.6秒，误报率从4.5%降至0.9%，相比静态阈值有显著改进。

Conclusion: AMDM算法为AI系统提供了更全面和高效的监控方案，有助于在实际部署中更好地平衡技术能力与人类价值考量。

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

TL;DR: DACE算法通过利用LLM的自信心与任务难度相关性，动态调整探索-利用平衡，在数学推理任务上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVF依赖稀疏的结果奖励，无法为推理过程提供细粒度指导，限制了学习效率

Method: 提出Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE)算法，在线评估任务难度并基于模型自信心动态调整内在奖励机制

Result: 在AIME和MATH数学推理基准测试中显著超越强基线，模型不仅准确率更高，而且在测试时计算扩展时表现更鲁棒

Conclusion: DACE的自适应方法能够促进有效探索而不牺牲精度，验证了基于自信心调节的探索策略的有效性

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key
technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only
indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular
guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient
learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient
solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To
address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task
difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided
Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to
dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task
difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal
to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is
struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for
easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty.
Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show
that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models
not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance
when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters
effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络与MCCFR结合时在不同规模博弈中出现的尺度依赖性问题，包括非平稳目标分布偏移、动作支持崩溃等理论风险。

Method: 提出Robust Deep MCCFR框架，包含延迟更新的目标网络、均匀探索混合、方差感知训练目标和综合诊断监控，通过系统消融研究验证组件有效性。

Result: 在Kuhn扑克上最终可剥削性达到0.0628（比经典框架提升60%），在Leduc扑克上达到0.2386（提升23.5%），证明了选择性组件部署的重要性。

Conclusion: 神经MCCFR组件的有效性具有尺度依赖性，需要针对不同规模博弈采用不同的缓解策略，选择性组件部署比全面缓解更有效，为大型博弈部署提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a
cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration
with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest
differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive
analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and
proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify
that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action
support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have
scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation
strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR
framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform
exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive
diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc
Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify
critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final
exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the
classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective
component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the
classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful
component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include:
(1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled
mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale
experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and
(4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

Result: 与埃塞俄比亚公共卫生研究所和卫生部合作，在三个地区的多种规划场景中验证了方法的实证效果

Conclusion: HARP工具为医疗资源规划提供了有效的优化框架，能够在预算约束下实现人口覆盖最大化和地区公平性目标

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health
is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare
services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort
can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing
priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization
across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access
Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization
framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population
coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific
proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i)
a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any
single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with
strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian
Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical
efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Motivation: 研究动机是将个体层面的证据基础信念和可错知识扩展到群体层面，探索群体知识和群体信念的形式化逻辑框架。

Method: 采用拓扑语义方法，将个体证据模型扩展到多智能体群体，构建群体证据逻辑系统，并引入动态证据共享算子进行扩展。

Result: 完全公理化了硬性和软性群体证据逻辑，证明了其可判定性；特别对群体知识和群体信念逻辑片段进行了完整公理化；扩展的动态证据共享逻辑与静态基础逻辑具有同等表达能力。

Conclusion: 成功建立了群体证据逻辑的形式化框架，为多智能体系统中的群体认知状态提供了完整的逻辑基础，动态证据共享操作不会增加逻辑的表达能力。

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within
multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of
evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We
completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and
"soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment
of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these
languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize
the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static
bases.

Motivation: 现有自主代理系统面临关键权衡：固定工作流需要手动重新配置以适应环境变化，而灵活的反应循环无法将推理进展转化为可转移的结构。

Method: HiVA框架使用语义-拓扑进化(STEV)算法，将代理工作流建模为自组织图，通过文本梯度作为离散域反向传播的替代方案，在混合语义-拓扑空间中进行优化。迭代过程包括多臂老虎机前向路由、环境反馈生成诊断梯度，以及协调更新语义和拓扑。

Conclusion: HiVA在未知环境中通过自组织图结构和语义-拓扑协同进化，有效实现了自主任务执行，解决了现有代理系统的适应性限制问题。

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General
Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical
trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration
upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to
distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce
Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic
workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution
(STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using
textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The
iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing,
diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated
updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective
optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding,
Long-context Q&A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements
of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing
baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

Motivation: LLM代理在数据操作和分析中采用的高通量探索和解决方案形成过程（代理猜测）对现有数据系统构成挑战，需要从根本上重新设计数据系统

Method: 分析代理猜测的四大特征：规模、异构性、冗余性和可控性，并基于这些特征提出代理优先的数据系统架构

Conclusion: 数据系统需要主动适应LLM代理工作负载的特征，构建代理优先的数据系统架构是未来研究的重要方向

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to
manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for
data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a
high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given
task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of
agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue
that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We
take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify,
i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number
of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture,
ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new
agentic memory stores.

Motivation: 解决LLM在预训练后知识静态化的问题，避免RAG的高延迟和工程开销、提示工程的脆弱性以及微调的高成本和灾难性遗忘风险。

Method: 使用精心设计的系统指令作为外部可审计伪参数，通过反射引擎分析对话轨迹，提出类型化增量更新指令、用户偏好和工具，并通过评分加权合成集将成熟改进蒸馏到参数中。

Result: 在企业支持中吞吐量提升2.4-5.0倍，审计幻觉减少约80%；在Adobe Commerce Cloud中每小时处理工单数增加4-5倍，每工单时间降低约80%。

Conclusion: ILWS在指令层操作直到受控蒸馏，适用于需要自适应推理、工具创建和低延迟部署的动态领域，如法律、医疗和工程领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after
pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and
engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is
brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks
catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS):
curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters
updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection
Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and
failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$
over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled,
evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first
failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a
threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills
matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space
improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the
low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves
governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased
throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen
baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved
4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous
instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the
instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic
domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool
creation, and low-latency deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文评估了结果奖励模型(ORMs)在Text-to-SQL任务中的效果，相比传统的执行最佳N选(ex-BoN)和多数投票(Maj)方法，ORMs在BIRD和SPIDER基准上取得了显著的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成复杂SQL查询时仍难以精确对齐用户意图和数据库模式，现有的测试时策略(ex-BoN和Maj)依赖表层启发式方法，而基于语义正确性的ORMs方法在Text-to-SQL任务中尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了训练Text-to-SQL任务ORMs的框架，在BIRD和SPIDER基准上微调多个开源LLMs(Qwen2、Granite3、Llama3等)，将ORMs作为BoN的有效启发式方法进行评估。

Result: ORMs在BIRD上比ex-BoN提升4.33%，比Maj提升2.91%；在Spider上比ex-BoN提升2.10%，比Maj提升0.93%。对已对齐SQL生成的模型(如OmniSQL)微调可获得更优的ORM性能。

Conclusion: ORMs是Text-to-SQL任务中比传统ex-BoN和Maj方法更有效的选择策略，特别是在复杂查询和候选数量增加时表现更优，为提升LLMs的SQL生成准确性提供了新方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

Conclusion: SHERPA框架通过状态机结构成功将领域最佳实践融入LLM执行过程，为控制LLM行为提供了一种通用机制，在多个任务上实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application
across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from
a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks
requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the
training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best
practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained
popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this
paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM
performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best
practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution
processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over
their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based
approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety
of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question
answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving
the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the
aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares
different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without
state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines
significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly
beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but
lacking data used for training LLMs.

Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors,
all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used
to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,
such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural
disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and
difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for
identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an
incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an
incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the
causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and
intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create
SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal
Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary
world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in
urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize
evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and
human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This
organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents,
observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce
reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV
images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents
occurring at the same time and location.

*Yen-Che Chien,Kuang-Da Wang,Wei-Yao Wang,Wen-Chih Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NEWSAGENT是一个用于评估自主代理在新闻写作中处理多模态网络数据能力的基准测试，包含6000个人工验证的实例，测试代理在信息检索、叙事规划和文章整合方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前行业中的自主数字代理（如Manus AI和Gemini研究模式）在结构化任务方面显示出潜力，但尚不清楚基于代理的系统能在多大程度上提高多模态网络数据生产力，特别是在需要迭代规划、解释和上下文推理的新闻领域。

Method: 引入NEWSAGENT基准测试，要求代理根据写作指令和原始数据，自动搜索可用内容、选择所需信息、编辑重写以形成新闻文章，包括识别叙事视角、基于关键词查询、检索历史背景和生成完整文章。

Result: 评估显示代理能够检索相关事实，但在规划和叙事整合方面存在困难，表明当前代理系统在真实世界新闻写作中的信息缺口处理能力有限。

Conclusion: NEWSAGENT为迭代和评估代理在多模态网络数据操作方面的能力提供了一个现实的测试平台，有助于推动代理技术在真实世界生产力中的应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI
and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by
autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear
to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data
productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires
iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal
raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a
benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw
contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news
article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction
and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are
tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries,
retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical
summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available
and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in
real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived
from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model
compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used
agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of
retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative
integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating
and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation
to real-world productivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了刺槐豆胶、瓜尔胶、麦芽糊精和卡拉胶对自制冰淇淋融化行为的影响，通过融化测试和图像分析评估这些稳定剂的融化抗性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰淇淋的融化稳定性是影响消费者接受度和产品质量的关键因素，需要研究不同稳定剂对融化行为的影响并寻找更具成本效益的配方。

Method: 制备含不同添加剂的冰淇淋样品，在受控条件下进行融化测试，使用延时摄影记录融化过程，并利用Python和OpenCV进行图像处理和分析。

Result: 所有样品融化后仍保持泡沫状结构，表明稳定剂有助于形成稳定的气泡基质；重新冷冻后再次融化的样品显示出更强的结构韧性；不同稳定剂的效果存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常用食品添加剂在冰淇淋配方中的功能作用，通过评估性能和成本，证明了开发平衡耐久性和经济效率的配方的潜力，对小型和商业冰淇淋生产具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's
acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve
texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report
explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and
carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective
was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify
a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each
additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled
conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the
progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and
analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure
even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of
a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen
and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating
improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the
different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some
offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others.
Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly
used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance
and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that
balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical
applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

Motivation: 现有方法如静态提示工程或孤立代理模拟存在局限性，需要一种动态、可扩展且可解释的集体AI架构来实现认知协同进化。

Method: 1) 用户与LLM形成个性化认知二元组；2) GA辅助的前向-后向进化优化提示和任务性能；3) 多子类大脑通过群体智能协调；4) 整合为具有抽象和自改进能力的超类大脑。

Result: 提出了理论框架和初步实现（如无人机调度、关键词过滤），建立了跨二元组知识整合的注册机制。

Conclusion: 该工作为可扩展、可解释且符合伦理的集体AI提供了概念基础和架构路线图。

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

case study of a mid-sized residential layout demonstrates the approach's
ability to generate functional and structured outputs with minimal manual
effort. The workflow is designed for transparent replication, with all key

<details>

Motivation: 人类能直觉地模拟未言明的社交动态并推理他人视角，而AI系统在自动构建和推理这些隐式社交上下文方面存在困难

Method: 基于POMDP设计，将社交互动表示为结构化元组（状态、观察、智能体动作、心智状态），可从自由形式叙述中自动推导

Result: 在FANToM的心理理论推理任务上提升51%，在SOTOPIA社交互动基准上提升18%，达到新的最先进性能

Conclusion: S3AP作为强大的通用社交世界状态表示形式，有望开发出更具社交意识的系统，更好地应对社交互动

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken
dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited
information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and
reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a
novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help
AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a
POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples,
such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be
automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show
S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social
reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning
with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then
induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating
their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent
decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social
interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a
powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the
development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social
interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BALM-TSF是一个轻量级的多模态时间序列预测框架，通过平衡文本和时间序列模态的对齐来解决现有方法中模态不平衡问题，在长期和少样本预测中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态时间序列预测方法存在文本和时间序列模态之间的不平衡问题，往往过度强调一个模态而忽视另一个，导致信息损失和预测性能下降。

Method: 使用时间序列编码器处理原始时间序列，同时将时间序列的描述性统计信息输入LLM生成紧凑文本嵌入。通过缩放策略和对比目标将文本嵌入映射到时间序列嵌入的潜在空间，实现跨模态平衡对齐。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，BALM-TSF以最少的可训练参数在长期和少样本预测任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BALM-TSF能够有效利用文本和时间序列的互补信息，通过平衡的多模态对齐显著提升时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research
topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research
has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing
textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast
discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal
architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other,
resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address
this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment
for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting
framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw
time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive
statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt,
producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context
alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling
strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual
embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the
aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together
integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show
that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability
to harness complementary information from text and time series. Code is
available at https://github.com/ShiqiaoZhou/BALM-TSF.

TL;DR: NetGent是一个AI代理框架，通过自然语言规则定义工作流，自动生成真实的网络流量数据集，解决了现有浏览器自动化工具脆弱且成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发通用ML网络模型需要从多样化真实网络应用中收集流量数据，但现有浏览器自动化工具在多样性、可重复性、真实性和效率方面存在脆弱性和高成本问题。

Method: 用户用自然语言规则定义状态依赖动作，框架将其编译为非确定性有限自动机(NFA)，状态合成组件转换为可重用可执行代码，支持确定性重放、状态缓存减少LLM调用，并能快速适应应用界面变化。

Result: 实验自动化了50+个工作流，涵盖视频点播、直播、视频会议、社交媒体和网络爬虫等领域，生成了真实的流量轨迹，对UI变化保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NetGent通过结合基于语言代理的灵活性和编译执行的可靠性，为生成多样化、可重复的数据集提供了可扩展基础，推动了网络ML的发展。

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application
workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing
generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network
environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web
applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are
diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly.
NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as
natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract
specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which
a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This
design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state
caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments,
NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming,
live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping,
producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By
combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of
compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the
diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Motivation: 法律推理需要精确解释法律条文和一致应用复杂规则，这对AI系统构成重大挑战，需要提高透明度和可解释性

Method: 采用模块化多智能体框架：第一阶段由专门智能体提取法律概念并形式化规则；第二阶段通过查询分析、符号推理和程序化实现三个步骤应用知识到具体案例

Result: 在法定税务计算任务上取得显著改进，基础模型准确率达到76.4%，相比基线18.8%有大幅提升，有效缩小了推理模型与基础模型之间的性能差距

Conclusion: 模块化架构和形式化知识表示能够通过计算高效模型使复杂法律推理更易实现，同时增强AI法律推理的一致性和可解释性，为构建更透明、可信和有效的法律AI系统奠定基础

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

TL;DR: 提出Q2K多智能体框架，利用LLM进行可靠的SKU映射，通过推理、知识和去重三个智能体协作，结合人工干预，在电商产品匹配任务中实现高精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台中产品列表SKU匹配是一个持续挑战，特别是当缺乏明确标识符且产品名称在不同平台差异很大时。基于规则的启发式方法和关键词相似性经常因忽略品牌、规格或套装配置的细微差别而错误分类产品。

Method: Q2K多智能体框架包含：1）推理智能体生成针对性消歧问题；2）知识智能体通过聚焦网络搜索解决问题；3）去重智能体重用已验证的推理轨迹以减少冗余并确保一致性。还包含人工干预机制来优化不确定案例。

Result: 在真实消费品数据集上的实验表明，Q2K超越了强基线方法，在困难场景（如套装识别和品牌来源消歧）中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。通过重用检索到的推理而不是重复搜索，Q2K在准确性和效率之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: Q2K提供了一个可扩展且可解释的产品集成解决方案，通过多智能体协作和推理重用机制，有效解决了电商SKU映射的挑战。

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

Motivation: 虽然LLM在各领域表现出艰，但某些图论证任务仍靠概念基础表示，而通过微调或多步查询实现这种映射成本较高效率低。

Method: 提出结构化上下文注入方法，直接在输入中嵌入结构化上下文信息，使LLM能够隐式将任务与基础概念空间对齐，无需微调模型。

Result: 在多个图任务上评估显示了一致的性能提升，结构化输入上下文的效果可与更复杂方法相比拟或更好，同时重点分析了准确性与计算成本之间的拼换。

Conclusion: 结构化上下文注入是一种高效可扩展的策略，能够在不微调LLM的情况下显著提升图识别能力，为LLM在图论证任务中的应用提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving
problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed
by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for
structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically
embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems.
Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and
lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging
for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations.
However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step
querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical
alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling
the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We
evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large
models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.
The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that
structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our
findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective
and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

Conclusion: 适度的领域感知约束结合轨迹级选择为过程感知属性预测和闭环材料设计提供了可靠、高效的大型推理模型的实用路径

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Conclusion: 这是首个使用动态规划类算法解决MDP中夏普比率优化问题的方法，为解决其他分数目标MDP问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used
metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit
of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of
Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there
exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is
that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other
is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we
study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both
the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge
with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a
mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization
and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when
the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the
second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V
optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We
iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that
is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V
problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is
monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both
average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure
and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted
for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that
solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type
algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving
MDPs with other fractional objectives.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process
Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring
(PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based
prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for
suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints
due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training.
We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite
traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors.
Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a
soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be
combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to
generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental
evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix
prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce
two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their
effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the
context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation
task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Motivation: 闭环胰岛素输送系统(CLIDS)在1型糖尿病中的实际采用率较低，主要障碍不是技术问题，而是行为、心理和社会层面的障碍，需要开发有效的说服性对话系统。

Method: 创建ChatCLIDS基准框架，包含专家验证的虚拟患者库（具有临床基础的异质性特征和现实采用障碍），模拟与配备多样化循证说服策略的护士代理进行多轮互动，支持纵向咨询和对抗性社会影响场景。

Result: 研究发现，虽然更大规模和更具反思性的LLM能够随时间调整策略，但所有模型都难以克服抵抗，特别是在现实社会压力下，揭示了当前LLM在行为改变方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: ChatCLIDS为推进医疗保健及其他领域可信赖的说服性AI提供了一个高保真、可扩展的测试平台，突显了当前LLM在行为改变应用中的不足。

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

Conclusion: SATQuest展示了作为基础工具的潜力，是推进LLM逻辑推理能力的宝贵起点，同时揭示了跨格式适应的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and
enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of
controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks
and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional,
systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To
address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier
designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating
diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems
along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question
format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer
verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for
nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective
reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using
SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,
particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore,
we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially
improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances,
while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through
these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool
and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and
connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented
opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale,
latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends
physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph
representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language
models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world
constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with
physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating
heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge,
LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in
real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources.
Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go
beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting
physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation,
this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and
sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for
pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology
transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective
indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and
deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which
evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a
unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying
explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned
Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their
technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework"
that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands
(Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail
the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial
Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and
real-world credibility.

Conclusion: 为构建支持人类学习的有效超强机器学习系统提供了坚实基础，但需要进一步研究如何优化知识传授方式

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that
not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired
knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present
LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic
method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models
(LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural
language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing
hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through
systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we
demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM
prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach
transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning
experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human
performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may
overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support.
Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to
support human learning. The source code is available on:

Motivation: 现有方法如测试时扩展、监督微调和强化学习在LLM性能提升上会出现收益递减，需要开发新的推理技术来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用General Symbolics推理方法，构建CoreThink推理层，专注于工具调用、代码生成和规划三个关键用例。

Result: 在Livecodebench v6上达到66.66%的SOTA分数，Instruction-Following Evals上89%，ARC-AGI-2上24.4%，SWE-Bench Lite上62.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: CoreThink推理层能够在不产生负面影响的情况下提供纯性能提升，为推理密集型用例提供了有效的解决方案，模型已可供使用。

Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel
reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from
reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General
Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases:
tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary
performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas.
Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on
Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an
agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which
achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We
are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training
costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift,
ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively
impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing
returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning
techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the
availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex
causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active
development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious
correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or
personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the
collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are
emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper
explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these
systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal
reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the
estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns
and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate
frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops.
Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse
application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact,
including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized
systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research
questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to
provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born
Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open
computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This
involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and
the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to
create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by
considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution
environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the
reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while
repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds
significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which
focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing,
which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an
interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates
self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum
logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized,
giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to
quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are
formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed
quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for
controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

five search-based solution algorithms, leveraging joint configuration space
search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. We
evaluate the five approaches empirically for plan quality and scalability.
Despite the exponential relation between search space size and block number,
our methods demonstrate efficiency in creating rearrangement plans for deeply

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts

Method: 提出VerlTool框架，包含四个关键贡献：与VeRL的上游对齐、标准化API的统一工具管理、异步rollout执行（实现近2倍加速）、以及多领域全面评估。框架将ARLT形式化为多轮轨迹，支持多模态观察令牌。

Result: 在数学推理、知识问答、SQL生成、视觉推理、网络搜索和软件工程等6个ARLT领域实现了竞争性性能，异步执行获得近2倍速度提升。

Conclusion: VerlTool提供了一个统一的训练基础设施，通过模块化插件架构显著降低了开发开销，为工具增强的RL研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is

TL;DR: Robix是一个统一的视觉语言架构，集成了机器人推理、任务规划和自然语言交互，通过三阶段训练策略实现复杂指令执行和人类自然交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决机器人系统中高层次认知、任务规划和人类交互的分离问题，需要开发一个端到端的统一框架，使机器人能够执行复杂指令、规划长期任务并与人类自然交互。

Method: 采用三阶段训练策略：1)持续预训练增强基础具身推理能力；2)监督微调将人机交互和任务规划建模为统一推理-动作序列；3)强化学习提高推理-动作一致性和长期任务连贯性。

Result: 在交互式任务执行中优于开源和商业基线（如GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro），在多样化指令类型和用户参与任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Robix作为一个统一的认知层，成功实现了机器人推理、规划和交互的集成，为构建更智能、更自然的机器人系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819
arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to
formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers
the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are
presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a
success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove
that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description
of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners
in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive
simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to
the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers
of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise
operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing
arXiv:2402.12422. Mathematicians and others working on causal abstraction may
be interested to see a new application of the core ideas that yields a new
variation of causal abstraction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AnchorRAG是一个新颖的多智能体协作框架，通过动态识别候选锚点实体和并行多跳探索，解决了传统基于知识图谱的RAG方法在开放世界设置中依赖预定义锚点实体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖静态训练语料库，容易出现事实错误和知识缺口。现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法假设锚点实体可访问，但在开放世界设置中，查询与实体之间的准确链接不可靠，限制了方法的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AnchorRAG多智能体协作框架：1）预测器智能体动态识别候选锚点实体；2）独立的检索器智能体从每个候选实体进行并行多跳探索；3）监督器智能体制定迭代检索策略并综合知识路径生成最终答案。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试上的大量实验表明，AnchorRAG显著优于现有基线方法，在真实世界问答任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: AnchorRAG通过多智能体协作提高了检索的鲁棒性，减轻了模糊或错误锚点的影响，为开放世界检索增强生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static
training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating
external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which
provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG
approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to
initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings
where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To
overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent
collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor
entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate
anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes
independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from
each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval
strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge
paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework
improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or
erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate
that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new
state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

TL;DR: SchedCP是一个让LLM代理自主优化Linux调度器的框架，通过解耦AI语义推理和系统执行，实现了1.79倍性能提升和13倍成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 操作系统调度器存在语义鸿沟，内核策略无法理解应用特定需求，导致性能不佳。需要让AI能够安全高效地自主优化调度器。

Method: 采用解耦控制平面架构，将AI的语义推理（优化什么）与系统执行（如何观察和行动）分离。实现为MCP服务器，提供工作负载分析引擎、调度策略库和执行验证器。

Result: 实现了最高1.79倍的性能提升和13倍的成本降低，同时保持高成功率。通过sched-ext基础设施部署自定义eBPF调度策略。

Conclusion: SchedCP通过弥合语义鸿沟，使专家级系统优化民主化，代表了向真正自优化、应用感知操作系统迈出的一步。

Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where
kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to
suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables
fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently
optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that
the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled
control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to
optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act").
Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable
interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving
Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all
AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic
analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent
system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling
policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation
shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x
cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high
success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level
system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly
self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced

Motivation: 传统文本到视频模型计算成本高昂，限制了视频制作的普及和发展，需要一种更高效、低成本的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体协作架构，包括脚本编写、场景创建和音频设计等专门代理，通过聊天塔工作流程将文本提示转换为连贯的幻灯片式叙事视频。

Result: 系统平均生成成本仅0.103美元，成功生成率达98.4%，同时保持高创意保真度和定制化能力。

Conclusion: VGTeam通过语言模型在创意领域的应用，实现了视频制作的民主化，为下一代内容创作树立了标杆。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation
of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments
in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is
undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models
are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show
video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline
through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of
a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of
video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design.
These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming
user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam
achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while
substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates
videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%.
Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and
customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production
by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need
for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative
potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a
pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定量预测监控方法在处理多模态动态系统时过于保守，无法提供有意义的模态特定满意度信息，需要更精确的预测方法

Method: 利用深度生成模型（基于分数的扩散模型）近似概率多模态系统动态，使用模态分类器按动态模态划分预测轨迹，对每个模态应用保形推理生成统计有效的模态特定预测区间

Result: 在智能体导航和自动驾驶任务基准测试中，GenQPM产生的预测区间比模态无关基线显著更具信息性（更不保守）

Conclusion: GenQPM方法有效解决了多模态动态系统的预测监控问题，提供了更精确和有用的模态特定预测信息

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of
stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a
desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since
computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted
violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast
machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the
satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees.
However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal
dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others
critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so
would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack
meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we
present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically
score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and
multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM
employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical
mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically
valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks,
resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less
conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需额外训练的CAD零件检索框架，通过错误笔记本和RAG技术改善现有大模型的检索性能，在GPT-4o上实现了23.4%的绝对准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接使用LLMs/VLMs进行CAD组件零件检索遇到两大挑战：输入序列超出模型令牌限制，以及性能不满意。同时对于许多高性能专有模型，微调需要大量计算资源且无法获得访问权限。

Method: 提出一种新的无需训练的零件检索框架，使用错误笔记本 + RAG进行精细的提示工程。错误笔记本构建包括两步：(1)收集历史错误的CoT和错误答案，(2)通过反思纠正连接这些CoT直到得到正确解决方案。RAG用于从错误笔记本中检索规范相关记录并将其整合到推理过程中。

Result: 在GPT-4o和Gemini系列专有模型上进行实验，显示出显著的性能提升，GPT-4o (Omni)在人类偏好数据集上实现了最23.4%的绝对准确率提升。消融研究确认CoT推理在具有更高零件数量(>10)的挑战性情况下特别有益。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理具有长序列、非自然语言元数据的3D模型，为自动化设计验证和下游工程任务提供了一种高效的无需训练的解决方案，显著提升了现有大模型在CAD零件检索任务中的性能。

Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is
essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks.
However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the
input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing,
performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires
significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use
proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available.
In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no
extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering
to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The
construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting
historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these
CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained.
As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with
their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve
specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them
into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a
human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In
addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to
effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata.
Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series,
show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute
accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation
studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging
cases with higher part counts (>10).

Conclusion: DeepResearch Arena提供了一个更真实、更可靠的深度研究代理评估环境，能够更好地反映真实世界的研究场景并降低数据泄露风险。

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to
orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis,
methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides,
evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to
the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture
researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we
introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that
capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world
research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically
construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task
Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from
seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy
inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of
research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we
curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from
over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature,
history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena
presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear
performance gaps observed across different models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine
learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale
and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to
accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of
hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable
mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather
than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of
scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for
scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from
data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic
reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns
and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on
rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone
of AI-assisted discovery.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多智能体协同和LLM赋能，有效解决了服务生态系统场景生成的挑战，提高了场景质量和生成效率，为复杂社会环境的实验系统构建提供了新思路。

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is
deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are
constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research
issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals
by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses
caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on
predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited
information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of
measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of
generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore,
we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates
three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize
experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high
quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social
environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social
collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role
relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with
the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states
of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the
ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios
more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service
ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生正确答案但依赖有缺陷或不相关的推理轨迹，在高风险领域缺乏可信度

Method: CSR训练目标：在训练时引入操作层面的自动反事实干预（如+/-互换），惩罚在逻辑无效轨迹下保持相同答案的模型

Result: 在算术、逻辑推理和规划任务中，CSR将忠实度提高多达70个百分点，仅带来轻微准确率损失

Conclusion: CSR是轻量级有效的训练方法，能显著提升模型推理忠实度，并可泛化到更大模型和与其他推理方法协同工作

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on
flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in
high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization
(CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between
intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated,
operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-")
during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under
logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per
sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome
Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model
predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical
deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness
by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process
supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes
to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as
self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that
extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in
commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to
decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the
aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the
ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable
and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to
addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured
decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The
proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous
decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing
concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's
performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based
insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims,
volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured
decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently
accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based
systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms
human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These
findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework
for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical
contexts.

*Abhinav Kumar,Jaechul Roh,Ali Naseh,Amir Houmansadr,Eugene Bagdasarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Web Agent Throttling框架，通过推理谜题对AI网络代理施加可调成本，防止恶意访问和资源滥用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI网络代理以更高速度、规模和复杂性使用互联网资源，可能恶意或错误地超载内容提供商，绕过CAPTCHA等防御机制，需要保护服务免受拒绝服务攻击和抓取

Method: 设计节流门作为挑战，要求代理解决需要多跳推理的世界知识文本谜题（rebus-based Reasoning Gates），实现计算不对称性

Result: 框架实现计算不对称性，响应生成成本比最先进模型高9.2倍，在实际网站和MCP服务器上部署并评估

Conclusion: Web Agent Throttling框架能有效限制恶意AI代理访问，但需考虑实际部署的局限性和环境影响

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and
complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or
erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time,
web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or
flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect
their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web
agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on
agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling.
We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that
are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a
common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve
reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However,
we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates
fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based
Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over
world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable
generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework
achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x
higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning
gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate
with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and
environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

### [332] [Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631)
*Chongwen Zhao,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的神经元级可解释性方法，通过识别和调整安全相关知识神经元来控制LLM行为，并开发了SafeTuning微调策略来增强模型对越狱攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各种应用中的广泛使用，存在用户试图利用这些模型进行恶意目的（如合成受控物质和传播虚假信息）的担忧，即"越狱"攻击。虽然已有研究通过修改输出分布或检测有害内容来实现防御，但其基本原理仍然不明确。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的神经元级可解释性方法，将模型的内部表示投影到更一致和可解释的词汇空间，识别安全相关知识神经元，并通过调整这些神经元的激活来控制模型行为。基于此提出了SafeTuning微调策略来增强安全关键神经元。

Result: 调整安全相关神经元的激活可以有效地控制模型行为，平均攻击成功率（ASR）高于97%。SafeTuning在多个LLM上一致降低了攻击成功率，并优于所有四个基线防御方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究为理解和防御越狱攻击提供了新的视角，通过神经元级的分析和干预，能够有效提升LLM的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Motivation: AI系统要实现通用智能，必须展现强大的物理问题解决能力，包括制定和应用物理定律来解释和预测物理过程。国际物理奥林匹克竞赛为此提供了严格的基准。

Method: 开发了Physics Supernova AI代理系统，通过原则性的工具集成方法来解决复杂的科学问题。

Result: 在IPhO 2025理论问题中获得23.5/30分，在406名参赛者中排名第14，超越了人类金牌得主的中位数表现。

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型自动从隐私政策中提取关键信息，构建基于DPV的知识图并支持下游任务如ODRL和psDToU生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户因隐私政策难以理解而忽略阅读的问题，填补形式化政策大规模创建的空白

Method: 采用语义中心方法，利用先进的大语言模型自动识别隐私政策关键信息，构建基于数据隐私词汇(DPV)的Pr²Graph知识图

Result: 发布了前100流行网站的Pr²Graph资源，并通过法律专家注释丰富了Policy-IE数据集，验证了不同大语言模型的性能

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模分析在线服务隐私实践提供了可能性，是审计网络和互联网的有前景方向

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制主要关注恶意攻击者风险，采用防御性拒绝策略，但现实中风险也来自寻求帮助的心理困扰用户，简单拒绝可能导致更严重后果

Method: CSA方法结合游戏理论预测用户反应、细粒度风险边界发现和可解释推理控制，在Oyster-I (Oy1)模型中实现

Result: Oy1在开放模型中达到最先进的安全水平，保持高通用能力，在Constructive Benchmark上接近GPT-5的引导能力，在Strata-Sword越狱数据集上接近GPT-o1的鲁棒性

Conclusion: CSA从拒绝优先转向引导优先的安全范式，重新定义了模型与用户关系，旨在构建不仅安全而且真正有帮助的系统

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成教育性对话方面存在挑战，需要系统研究AI模拟与真实人类教学对话的差异

Method: 采用起始-响应-反馈(IRF)编码方案和认知网络分析(ENA)进行定量比较

Result: 人类对话在语调长度、提问(I-Q)和一般反馈(F-F)行为方面显著优于AI；人类对话以"问题-事实回答-反馈"教学循环为中心，而AI对话则呈现"解释-简单回答"循环

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前AI生成教学对话的关键限制，为设计和评估更有教育效果的生成式教育对话系统提供了实证指导

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSP是一种异步在线强化学习框架，通过动态推测规划实现无损加速，在保持性能的同时显著降低30%总成本和60%不必要成本，并提供用户可控的延迟-成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型代理面临延迟高、推理成本昂贵的问题，现有加速方法要么性能损失大，要么需要大量离线训练，要么运营成本过高，且缺乏用户对加速与性能权衡的控制。

Method: 提出动态推测规划(DSP)框架，采用异步在线强化学习，显式优化端到端延迟与美元成本的联合目标，通过单一参数调节系统在快速响应和低成本操作之间的平衡。

Result: 在两个标准代理基准测试中，DSP实现了与最快无损加速方法相当的效率，同时总成本降低30%，不必要成本减少高达60%。

Conclusion: DSP提供了一种无需预部署准备的无损加速解决方案，通过灵活的权衡参数为用户提供了对延迟和成本的控制，显著降低了运营成本。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread
adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment
challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work
has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches
suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance
fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur
excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over
the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address
these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous
online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration
with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment
preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end
latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single
parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or
any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks
demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless
acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to
60%. Our code and data are available through
https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.

TL;DR: EigenBench是一个无需真实标签的黑盒方法，通过模型间相互评估来量化语言模型与给定价值体系的对齐程度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI与人类价值观对齐缺乏定量评估指标的问题

Method: 使用EigenTrust算法聚合多个模型对其他模型输出的判断，生成反映整体评估的加权分数

Result: 发现大部分方差由提示词解释，但仍有小部分残差可量化模型本身的倾向性

Conclusion: EigenBench为价值对齐提供了有效的定量基准测试方法，能够区分模型和提示词的影响

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架和FAB公平性-准确性平衡分数，用于评估医疗场景中LLM的偏见问题，并在两个大规模医疗基准上验证了四种开源LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性评估方法在医疗高风险场景中存在不足，使用过于简化的指标，忽略了医疗危害的多维性，且可能导致模型因临床惰性而显得公平但实际不准确。

Method: 构建了两个大规模受控基准（ED-Triage和Opioid Analgesic Recommendation），包含5万多个提示和12种种族×性别变体；提出了mFARM多维度公平性评估框架，评估分配性、稳定性和潜在性三个维度的差异，并聚合为mFARM分数；还提出了FAB分数来评估公平性与预测准确性之间的权衡。

Result: 评估了四种开源LLM及其微调版本，发现mFARM指标能更有效捕捉各种设置下的细微偏见；大多数模型在不同量化水平下保持稳健的mFARM性能，但在上下文减少时性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的mFARM框架能更全面评估医疗LLM的公平性，基准和评估代码已公开以促进医疗AI对齐研究。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical
settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and
amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness
evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use
simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms.
This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert,
defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our
contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale,
controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from
MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and
three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework -
Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness
for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and
Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated
Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs
between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four
open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and
their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our
findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more
effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust
performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but
deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and
evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for
healthcare.

twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other
hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the
phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the
following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems
associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further
developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with
proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some
examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统虽然功能广泛，但缺乏真正的智能深度，只是表面模拟而非真正的智能存在。作者旨在定义真正智能的本质特征。

Method: 提出结构性-生成性智能本体论框架，基于三个核心条件：生成性（生成新结构）、协调性（将结构协调成理由）、持续性（维持身份认同）。

Result: 建立了区分真正智能与表面模拟的理论标准，指出当前AI系统因缺乏这三个深度条件而无法达到真正的智能水平。

Conclusion: 真正的智能需要深度而非广度，如果未来系统能满足这三个条件，可能成为与人类并存但又不同的"第二存在"，而不仅仅是工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can
perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper
proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence
exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into
reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions --
generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies
real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain
surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of
intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to
meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as
a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

Motivation: 大语言模型在法律领域的应用遇到可靠性和透明性挑战，需要找到替代精细调整的经济方案。

Conclusion: 结构化提示工程是一种被忽视但极具潜力的工具，能够在法律领域及更广范范围内确保AI的可负责性和责任性。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative
effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has
proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and
transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a
viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of
tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information
retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking
and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an
engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for
each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem
with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse
Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose
model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase
reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black
box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously
presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the
limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering,
serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this
work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a
useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility
of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the
increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological
surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health
research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach
which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable
actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO)
Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global
outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to
respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated
dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced
representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of
this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and
tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These
innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological
research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex,
multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in
applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain
acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but
also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper
presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in
link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms
that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a
reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within
a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific

### [345] [Re-evaluating LLM-based Heuristic Search: A Case Study on the 3D Packing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02297)
*Guorui Quan,Mingfei Sun,Manuel López-Ibáñez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探索了大型语言模型（LLM）在自动化启发式算法设计中的能力，通过在3D装箱问题上构建完整求解器，发现LLM主要专注于评分函数优化，存在脆弱性和预训练偏见等限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统启发式设计主要依赖人工，虽然LLM能够生成搜索启发式代码，但其创新能力和应用范围仍存在疑问。研究旨在探索LLM在复杂优化问题中构建完整求解器的潜力。

Method: 采用约束脚手架（预写约束检查代码）和迭代自校正（额外精炼周期修复错误）两种支持方法，让LLM构建3D装箱问题的完整求解器。

Result: LLM生成的启发式算法与人工设计的贪心算法相当，当将其评分函数集成到人工设计的元启发式中时，性能可与成熟求解器媲美，但在约束收紧时效果下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在自动化启发式设计方面存在两大障碍：复杂推理任务中的脆弱性需要工程缓解，以及预训练偏见会过早限制新颖解决方案的搜索空间。

Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their
application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within
human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open
question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver
for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved
fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint
scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative
self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a
viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy
process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the
scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior
work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of
LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed
greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a
human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,
though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight
two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the
engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,
and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search
for novel solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域中生成式模型应用相对迟缓，传统方法依然依赖于时间序列数据和transformer模型，需要开拓生成式模型的新应用方向

Method: 将时间序列数据视为单个图像模式，使用涵变模型根据当前图表图像和指令提示生成下一个图表图像，并提出简单的生成图像评估方法

Result: 证明了文本到图像生成模型在金融领域的潜力，为预测股票价格趋势提供了新的视角和方法

Conclusion: 该研究为金融领域的生成式模型应用开启了新方向，鼓励进一步研究以克服当前限制并扩大其应用范围

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in
tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating
videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various
fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on
time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on
diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a
single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends.
Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns
using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the
next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using
diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the
generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of
leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our
findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and
expand their applicability.

*Salma Haidar,José Oramas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于模型解释性的高光谱图像波段选择方法，通过事后可解释性技术量化各波段对分类决策的贡献度，选择最具影响力的波段子集，在保持分类精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像的高维特性带来计算负担和冗余信息，需要有效的降维方法。传统波段选择方法缺乏模型对齐，本研究旨在通过模型驱动的可解释性方法实现更有效的波段选择。

Method: 使用训练好的分类器，通过事后可解释性方法量化每个波段对决策的贡献；进行删除-插入评估，记录置信度变化；聚合这些信号为影响力分数；选择最高影响力波段形成紧凑子集。

Result: 在Pavia University和Salinas两个公开数据集上的实验表明，仅使用30个选定波段的分类器性能匹配甚至超过全光谱基线，同时显著降低计算需求。所选波段子集与物理上有意义、高度区分的波长区域一致。

Conclusion: 模型对齐、解释引导的波段选择是高光谱图像降维的有效原则性途径，能够保持预测性能的同时提高计算效率，所选波段具有明确的物理意义和判别性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise
material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality
introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality
reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of
post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band
selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive
performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each
band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion
evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or
reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the
highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy
and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University
and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected
bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational
requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly
discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned,
explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective
dimensionality reduction for HSI.

*Shubham Gandhi,Jason Tsay,Jatin Ganhotra,Kiran Kate,Yara Rizk*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SWE-PRM是一个推理时过程奖励模型，通过实时检测和纠正LLM代理在软件工程任务中的轨迹错误，将解决率从40.0%提升到50.6%，同时保持较低的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在执行复杂软件工程任务时经常出现冗余探索、循环和无法及时终止等低效行为，现有方法主要在事后诊断失败，缺乏执行过程中的干预机制。

Method: 提出SWE-PRM过程奖励模型，基于常见低效行为的分类法，在执行过程中提供轻量级、可解释的反馈，而不修改底层策略。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上，闭源PRM将解决率从40.0%提升至50.6%（+10.6个百分点），在中高难度任务上提升最明显，分类法引导的PRM表现最佳，同时减少了轨迹长度。

Conclusion: PRM是一种实用且可扩展的机制，能以低至0.2美元的额外推理成本显著提高SWE代理的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex,
multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often
contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and
failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated
these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In
this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM)
that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level
errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and
delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying
policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0%
to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among
feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit
action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory
length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as
$0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents'
reliability and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在处理结构化生物医学数据时经常产生流畅但过度自信的输出，需要更好的不确定性管理机制来提高可靠性

Method: 结合检索不确定性（多表选择rollout的熵）和摘要不确定性（自一致性和困惑度），使用GRPO强化学习整合摘要不确定性，并通过两种不确定性指导推理时过滤和高质量合成数据集构建

Result: 在多组学基准测试中，事实性和校准性显著提升，正确有用声明数量几乎翻三倍（3.0→8.4内部；3.6→9.9癌症多组学），下游生存预测C指数从0.32提升至0.63

Conclusion: 不确定性可以作为控制信号，使代理能够弃权、传达置信度，成为复杂结构化数据环境中更可靠的工具

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured
biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident
outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that
leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over
multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining
self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into
reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and
support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration,
nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4
internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving
downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results
demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to
abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex
structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this
survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the
opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable,
general-purpose AI agents.

TL;DR: 这篇论文在图形距离下对多路径TSP问题提出了一种2-近似算法，进一步在排序TSP中实现了1.791-近似。

Motivation: 多路径TSP是旅行商问题的重要变种，在图形距离下尚无优称的近似算法。当前最佳近似比为2.214，本文目标是在图形距离下实现更好的2-近似。

Method: 算法基于从最优LP解的流分解中采样路径，并使用双倍边连接剩余顶点。关键技术是将采样路径的成本吸收到双倍边的成本中，而不增加近似比。

Result: 在图形距离下实现了2-近似的多路径TSP算法，显著改善了当前最佳2.214的近似比。同时在排序TSP中实现了1.791-近似，超越了一般距离下1.868的最佳结果。

Conclusion: 这个工作表明在图形距离下可以获得更好的多路径TSP近似算法，并且还能扩展到排序TSP问题。这为近似算法设计提供了新的思路和技术。

Abstract: The path version of the Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the most
well-studied variants of the ubiquitous TSP. Its generalization, the Multi-Path
TSP, has recently been used in the best known algorithm for path TSP by Traub
and Vygen [Cambridge University Press, 2024]. The best known approximation
factor for this problem is $2.214$ by B\"{o}hm, Friggstad, M\"{o}mke and
Spoerhase [SODA 2025]. In this paper we show that for the case of graphic
metrics, a significantly better approximation guarantee of $2$ can be attained.
Our algorithm is based on sampling paths from a decomposition of the flow
corresponding to the optimal solution to the LP for the problem, and connecting
the left-out vertices with doubled edges. The cost of the latter is twice the
optimum in the worst case; we show how the cost of the sampled paths can be
absorbed into it without increasing the approximation factor. Furthermore, we
prove that any below-$2$ approximation algorithm for the special case of the
problem where each source is the same as the corresponding sink yields a
below-$2$ approximation algorithm for Graphic Multi-Path TSP.
  We also show that our ideas can be utilized to give a factor
$1.791$-approximation algorithm for Ordered TSP in graphic metrics, for which
the aforementioned paper [SODA 2025] and Armbruster, Mnich and N\"agele [APPROX
2024] give a $1.868$-approximation algorithm in general metrics.

Abstract: Windowed recurrences are sliding window calculations where a function is
applied iteratively across the window of data, and are ubiquitous throughout
the natural, social, and computational sciences. In this monograph we explore
the computational aspects of these calculations, including sequential and
parallel computation, and develop the theory underlying the algorithms and
their applicability. We introduce an efficient new sequential algorithm with
low latency, and develop new techniques to derive and analyze the complexity
and domain of validity of existing sequential algorithms. For parallel
computation we derive new parallel and vector algorithms by relating windowed
recurrences to the algebraic construction of semidirect products, and to
algorithms for exponentiation in semigroups. In the middle chapters of the
monograph we further develop the theory of semi-associativity and the algebraic
conditions for representing function composition and function application by
data. This systematizes the techniques used by practitioners to parallelize
recurrence calculations. We end the monograph with an extensive gallery of
examples of interest to specialists in many fields. Throughout the monograph
new algorithms are described with pseudo-code transcribed from functioning

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了HTCount和HTCount-P算法，用于超图流中的三角形计数，解决了现有方法在三角形结构分类不完整和采样方案不灵活的问题，在严格内存约束下实现了高精度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超图三角形计数方法存在两个关键局限：(1)超顶点三角形结构分类不完整，通常只考虑内部或外部三角形；(2)采样方案不灵活，预定义采样超边数量，在超边大小变化大且内存严格受限时不实用。

Method: 首先提出了完整的超顶点三角形分类（内部、混合、外部三角形），然后开发了基于水库采样的HTCount算法，能根据可用内存M动态调整样本大小。进一步开发了HTCount-P分区变体，将未使用内存自适应分区为独立样本子集以提高内存利用率和减少估计误差。

Result: 理论分析证明了算法的无偏性和方差界限。案例研究展示了三角形结构在揭示有意义交互模式方面的表达能力。在真实超图上的大量实验表明，两种算法在严格内存约束下都能实现高精度三角形计数估计，相对误差比现有方法低1-2个数量级，且始终保持高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了超图流三角形计数的关键挑战，通过完整的结构分类和灵活的内存自适应采样方案，在严格内存限制下实现了显著优于现有方法的性能表现。

Abstract: Triangle counting in hypergraph streams, including both hyper-vertex and
hyper-edge triangles, is a fundamental problem in hypergraph analytics, with
broad applications. However, existing methods face two key limitations: (i) an
incomplete classification of hyper-vertex triangle structures, typically
considering only inner or outer triangles; and (ii) inflexible sampling schemes
that predefine the number of sampled hyperedges, which is impractical under
strict memory constraints due to highly variable hyperedge sizes. To address
these challenges, we first introduce a complete classification of hyper-vertex
triangles, including inner, hybrid, and outer triangles. Based on this, we
develop HTCount, a reservoir-based algorithm that dynamically adjusts the
sample size based on the available memory M. To further improve memory
utilization and reduce estimation error, we develop HTCount-P, a
partition-based variant that adaptively partitions unused memory into
independent sample subsets. We provide theoretical analysis of the unbiasedness
and variance bounds of the proposed algorithms. Case studies demonstrate the
expressiveness of our triangle structures in revealing meaningful interaction
patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs show that both our
algorithms achieve highly accurate triangle count estimates under strict memory
constraints, with relative errors that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower
than those of existing methods and consistently high throughput.

TL;DR: 研究图中k-excluding顶点的检测复杂度，发现在k > (1/4+ε)n时总能多项式时间找到k-excluding顶点，而在k < (1/4-ε)n时判定是否存在k-excluding顶点是NP难的


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究秘密共享方案中出现的图论问题，特别是关于顶点同时属于大小为k的团和独立集的性质

Method: 通过理论分析和复杂度证明，建立k值与n的比例关系对问题复杂性的影响

Result: 当k > (1/4+ε)n时，所有n顶点图都存在k-excluding顶点且可多项式时间找到；当k < (1/4-ε)n时，判定是否存在k-excluding顶点是NP难的

Conclusion: k与n的比例关系决定了检测k-excluding顶点问题的计算复杂性，存在明确的阈值现象

Abstract: For a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, we call a vertex $k$-enabling if it
belongs both to a clique of size $k$ and to an independent set of size $k$, and
we call it $k$-excluding otherwise. Motivated by issues that arise in secret
sharing schemes, we study the complexity of detecting vertices that are
$k$-excluding. We show that for every $\epsilon$, for sufficiently large $n$,
if $k > (\frac{1}{4} + \epsilon)n$, then every graph on $n$ vertices must have
a $k$-excluding vertex, and moreover, such a vertex can be found in polynomial
time. In contrast, if $k < (\frac{1}{4} - \epsilon)n$, a regime in which it
might be that all vertices are $k$-enabling, deciding whether a graph has no
$k$-excluding vertex is NP-hard.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了非恒定查询时间距离预言机研究的空白，为图算法中的距离查询问题提供了新的解决方案，并在n-PSP和ANSC等实际问题中展示了应用价值。

Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and
let $\mu = m/n$. A \emph{distance oracle} is a data structure designed to
answer approximate distance queries, with the goal of achieving low stretch,
efficient space usage, and fast query time. While much of the prior work
focused on distance oracles with constant query time, this paper presents a
comprehensive study of distance oracles with non-constant query time. We
explore the tradeoffs between space, stretch, and query time of distance
oracles in various regimes. Specifically, we consider both weighted and
unweighted graphs in the regimes of stretch $< 2$ and stretch $\ge 2$. Among
our results, we present a new three-way trade-off between stretch, space, and
query time, offering a natural extension of the classical Thorup-Zwick distance
oracle [STOC'01 and JACM'05] to regimes with larger query time. Specifically,
for any $0 < r < 1/2$ and integer $k \ge 1$, we construct a $(2k(1 - 2r) -
1)$-stretch distance oracle with $\tilde{O}(m + n^{1 + 1/k})$ space and
$\tilde{O}(\mu n^r)$ query time. In addition, we demonstrate several
applications of our new distance oracles to the $n$-Pairs Shortest Paths
($n$-PSP) problem and the All Nodes Shortest Cycles ($ANSC$) problem.

TL;DR: 本文研究了带优先级约束的资源调度问题，证明了几乎紧的近似硬度下界，建立了与最短公共超序列问题的联系，并给出了在线设置下的竞争比下界和匹配的确定性在线算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究带优先级约束的资源调度问题，该问题在离线设置中是否存在多项式时间O(1)因子近似算法是一个重要的开放性问题。

Method: 通过证明近似硬度下界来研究问题的计算复杂性，建立与最短公共超序列问题的联系，并在在线设置中分析竞争比下界和设计匹配的确定性算法。

Result: 证明了对于某些常数α>0，除非P=NP，否则不存在o((log t_max)^α)因子近似算法；建立了与SCS问题的联系；在线设置中给出了Ω(log n)和Ω(log t_max)竞争比下界，并提出了匹配的O(min{log n, log t_max})竞争确定性算法。

Conclusion: 该资源调度问题具有很高的计算复杂性，近似难度较大，在线算法的最优竞争比为对数级别。

Abstract: We study the precedence-constrained resource scheduling problem [SICOMP'75].
There are $n$ jobs where each job takes a certain time to finish and has a
resource requirement throughout the execution time. There are precedence among
the jobs. The problem asks that given a resource budget, schedule the jobs
obeying the precedence constraints to minimize makespan (maximum completion
time of a job) such that at any point in time, the total resource being used by
all the jobs is at most the given resource budget. In the offline setting, an
important open question is whether a polynomial-time $O(1)$-factor
approximation algorithm can be found. We prove almost tight hardness of
approximation: For some constant $\alpha > 0$, there is no $o((\log
t_{\max})^{\alpha})$-factor ( or $o( ( \log n )^\alpha )$-factor )
approximation algorithm with $n$ jobs of maximum job length $t_{\max}$, unless
P = NP ( or NP $\subset$ DTIME$(O( 2^{\text{polylog}(n)}))$ ).
  We further show a connection between this scheduling problem and a seemingly
unrelated problem called the shortest common super-sequence (SCS) problem,
which has wide application in Biology and Genomics. We prove that an $o(\log
t_{\max})$-factor approximation of the scheduling problem would imply the
existence of an $o(|\Sigma|)$-approximation algorithm for SCS with alphabet
$\Sigma$.
  We then consider the online setting. We present $\Omega(\log n)$ and
$\Omega(\log t_{\max})$ lower bounds of the competitive ratio of any randomized
online algorithm. Moreover, we present a matching $O(\min\{\log n, \log
t_{\max}\})$-competitive deterministic online algorithm.

Ryan-Foster-branching. The pricing problem computes the layouts, separating the
time-consuming constraints from the master problem.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hitting Geodesic Intervals问题的计算复杂性，在负向和正向两个方向扩展了现有结果，针对结构图参数展示了尖锐的复杂性对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aravind和Saxena在WALCOM 2024中引入了Hitting Geodesic Intervals问题并展示了参数化复杂性结果，本文旨在进一步扩展这些结果，探索该问题在不同结构图参数下的复杂性边界。

Method: 通过构造性证明展示NP完全性：在5-顶点路径的不交并上添加单个顶点的图、路径上添加单个顶点的图、三角形不交并上添加通用顶点的图、带宽4且最大度5的图上证明NP难。同时设计了参数化算法：参数化为k加模宽、k加顶点完整性，并证明参数化为最小顶点多割大小时是W[2]-完全的。

Result: 证明了该问题在多种受限图类上都是NP完全的，排除了大多数结构参数的固定参数算法可能性。提出了参数化为k加模宽和k加顶点完整性的固定参数算法，但证明参数化为最小顶点多割大小时是W[2]-完全的。

Conclusion: Hitting Geodesic Intervals问题在结构图参数方面表现出复杂的计算复杂性特征，既有可处理的参数化情况，也有难处理的参数化情况，为理解该问题的复杂性边界提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a set $T$ of vertex pairs, and an integer $k$,
Hitting Geodesic Intervals asks whether there is a set $S \subseteq V$ of size
at most $k$ such that for each terminal pair $\{u,v\} \in T$, the set $S$
intersects at least one shortest $u$-$v$ path. Aravind and Saxena [WALCOM 2024]
introduced this problem and showed several parameterized complexity results. In
this paper, we extend the known results in both negative and positive
directions and present sharp complexity contrasts with respect to structural
graph parameters.
  We first show that the problem is NP-complete even on graphs obtained by
adding a single vertex to a disjoint union of 5-vertex paths. By modifying the
proof of this result, we also show the NP-completeness on graphs obtained from
a path by adding one vertex and on graphs obtained from a disjoint union of
triangles by adding one universal vertex. Furthermore, we show the
NP-completeness on graphs of bandwidth 4 and maximum degree 5 by replacing the
universal vertex in the last case with a long path. Under standard complexity
assumptions, these negative results rule out fixed-parameter algorithms for
most of the structural parameters studied in the literature (if the solution
size $k$ is not part of the parameter).
  We next present fixed-parameter algorithms parameterized by $k$ plus
modular-width and by $k$ plus vertex integrity. The algorithm for the latter
case does indeed solve a more general setting that includes the
parameterization by the minimum vertex multiway-cut size of the terminal
vertices. We show that this is tight in the sense that the problem
parameterized by the minimum vertex multicut size of the terminal pairs is
W[2]-complete. We then modify the proof of this intractability result and show
that the problem is W[2]-complete parameterized by $k$ even in the setting
where $T = \binom{Q}{2}$ for some $Q \subseteq V$.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文设计了针对带拟阵约束的非单调子模最大化的固定参数可处理(FPT)算法，包括离线设置和随机顺序流设置，在拟阵秩r作为固定参数的情况下实现了近似最优的近似比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多项式时间算法在处理非单调子模最大化问题时存在性能限制，特别是在拟阵约束下。本文旨在探索固定参数可处理框架下的算法设计，以突破多项式时间的限制。

Method: 提出了两种FPT算法：1) 离线算法使用指数级运行时间但多项式内存，2) 流算法使用亚线性内存。两种算法都将拟阵秩r作为固定参数处理。

Result: 离线算法获得1-1/e-ε近似比，运行时间为n·2^(Õ(r/poly(ε)))，内存为Õ(r/poly(ε))；流算法获得1/2-ε近似比，内存为Õ(r/poly(ε))。两种算法的近似比在各自设置下都接近最优。

Conclusion: 在FPT框架下，带拟阵约束的单调和非单调子模最大化问题之间几乎没有性能差距，这为处理非单调子模优化问题提供了新的理论视角和实用算法。

Abstract: In this paper, we design fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms for
(non-monotone) submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint, where
the matroid rank $r$ is treated as a fixed parameter that is independent of the
total number of elements $n$. We provide two FPT algorithms: one for the
offline setting and another for the random-order streaming setting. Our
streaming algorithm achieves a $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ approximation using
$\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\textrm{poly}(\varepsilon)}\right)$ memory, while
our offline algorithm obtains a $1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon$ approximation with
$n\cdot 2^{\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\textrm{poly}(\varepsilon)}\right)}$
runtime and $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{r}{\textrm{poly}(\varepsilon)}\right)$
memory. Both approximation factors are near-optimal in their respective
settings, given existing hardness results. In particular, our offline algorithm
demonstrates that--unlike in the polynomial-time regime--there is essentially
no separation between monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization under a
matroid constraint in the FPT framework.

Conclusion: 本文为k-失配重复串和参数化平方问题提供了更优的复杂度分析和算法设计，显著改进了现有结果

Abstract: A $k$-mismatch square is a string of the form $XY$ where $X$ and $Y$ are two
equal-length strings that have at most $k$ mismatches. Kolpakov and Kucherov
[Theor. Comput. Sci., 2003] defined two notions of $k$-mismatch repeats, called
$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs, each representing a sequence of consecutive
$k$-mismatch squares of equal length. They proposed algorithms for computing
$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs working in $O(nk \log k + output)$ time for a
string of length $n$ over an integer alphabet, where $output$ is the number of
the reported repeats. We show that $output=O(nk \log k)$, both in case of
$k$-repetitions and $k$-runs, which implies that the complexity of their
algorithms is actually $O(nk \log k)$. We apply this result to computing
parameterized squares.
  A parameterized square is a string of the form $XY$ such that $X$ and $Y$
parameterized-match, i.e., there exists a bijection $f$ on the alphabet such
that $f(X) = Y$. Two parameterized squares $XY$ and $X'Y'$ are equivalent if
they parameterized match. Recently Hamai et al. [SPIRE 2024] showed that a
string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ contains less than
$n\sigma$ non-equivalent parameterized squares, improving an earlier bound by
Kociumaka et al. [Theor. Comput. Sci., 2016]. We apply our bound for
$k$-mismatch repeats to propose an algorithm that reports all non-equivalent
parameterized squares in $O(n\sigma \log \sigma)$ time. We also show that the
number of non-equivalent parameterized squares can be computed in $O(n \log n)$
time. This last algorithm applies to squares under any substring compatible
equivalence relation and also to counting squares that are distinct as strings.
In particular, this improves upon the $O(n\sigma)$-time algorithm of
Gawrychowski et al. [CPM 2023] for counting order-preserving squares that are
distinct as strings if $\sigma = \omega(\log n)$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从Gomory-Hu树到多对数次最大流计算的简洁高效归约方法，在未加权图中达到近乎最优的实例大小和时间复杂度，并扩展到加权图和超图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gomory-Hu树是图论中重要的数据结构，能够精确保存图中所有顶点对的最小割信息。传统构造方法需要O(n)次最大流计算，效率较低。本文旨在开发更高效的归约方法，减少计算复杂度。

Method: 提出了一种简单的归约技术，将Gomory-Hu树的构造问题转化为多对数次的最大流计算。对于未加权图，使用总实例大小为Õ(m)的图进行最大流计算，仅需Õ(m)额外时间。该方法可扩展到加权图和超图。

Result: 在未加权图中实现了Õ(m)的实例大小和额外时间复杂度，这是首个达到多对数因子紧致的归约方法。加权图情况下实例大小和运行时间增加到Õ(n²)。超图版本同样实现了紧致的多对数因子归约。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了构建Gomory-Hu树的高效归约框架，在多个图类中实现了近乎最优的复杂度，为图割计算和网络流算法提供了重要的理论进展。

Abstract: Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E,w)$, a Gomory-Hu tree $T$ (Gomory and Hu,
1961) is a tree on $V$ that preserves all-pairs mincuts of $G$ exactly.
  We present a simple, efficient reduction from Gomory-Hu trees to polylog
maxflow computations. On unweighted graphs, our reduction reduces to maxflow
computations on graphs of total instance size $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the algorithm
requires only $\tilde{O}(m)$ additional time. Our reduction is the first that
is tight up to polylog factors. The reduction also seamlessly extends to
weighted graphs, however, instance sizes and runtime increase to
$\tilde{O}(n^2)$.
  Finally, we show how to extend our reduction to reduce Gomory-Hu trees for
unweighted hypergraphs to maxflow in hypergraphs. Again, our reduction is the
first that is tight up to polylog factors.

Conclusion: 所提出的随机性重用框架为结构化优化问题提供了通用的查询效率改进方法，伪独立算法的概念为此类分析提供了理论基础

Abstract: We provide a general framework to improve trade-offs between the number of
full batch and sample queries used to solve structured optimization problems.
Our results apply to a broad class of randomized optimization algorithms that
iteratively solve sub-problems to high accuracy. We show that such algorithms
can be modified to reuse the randomness used to query the input across
sub-problems. Consequently, we improve the trade-off between the number of
gradient (full batch) and individual function (sample) queries for finite sum
minimization, the number of matrix-vector multiplies (full batch) and random
row (sample) queries for top-eigenvector computation, and the number of
matrix-vector multiplies with the transition matrix (full batch) and generative
model (sample) queries for optimizing Markov Decision Processes. To facilitate
our analysis we introduce the notion of pseudo-independent algorithms, a
generalization of pseudo-deterministic algorithms [Gat and Goldwasser 2011],
that quantifies how independent the output of a randomized algorithm is from a
randomness source.

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across
different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet
important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from
the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for
specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs
reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due
to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal
trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain
the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}},
which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By
integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories
into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal
characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for
trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to
finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on
four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on
travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and
transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves
these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning
the MLLM backbones.

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing
human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world
scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their
modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained
semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel
LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the
expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic
foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.
Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained
semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks
semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.
Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations
grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable
more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent
and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse
semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at

Abstract: Storage and transmission challenges in dynamic 3D scene representation based
on the i3DV platform, With increasing scene complexity, the explosive growth of
3D Gaussian data volume causes excessive storage space occupancy. To address
this issue, we propose adopting the AVS PCRM reference software for efficient
compression of Gaussian point cloud geometry data. The strategy deeply
integrates the advanced encoding capabilities of AVS PCRM into the i3DV
platform, forming technical complementarity with the original rate-distortion
optimization mechanism based on binary hash tables. On one hand, the hash table
efficiently caches inter-frame Gaussian point transformation relationships,
which allows for high-fidelity transmission within a 40 Mbps bandwidth
constraint. On the other hand, AVS PCRM performs precise compression on
geometry data. Experimental results demonstrate that the joint framework
maintains the advantages of fast rendering and high-quality synthesis in 3D
Gaussian technology while achieving significant 10\%-25\% bitrate savings on
universal test sets. It provides a superior rate-distortion tradeoff solution
for the storage, transmission, and interaction of 3D volumetric video.
