We then analyze\nthe theoretical efficiency of the Pick-A-Perm algorithm, and show how it can be\ncombined with the LR-aggregation algorithm using another data structure that we\ndevelop. We demonstrate through experimental evaluations that LR-Aggregation\nproduces close to optimal solutions in practice.

We propose Robult, a scalable framework\ndesigned to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific\ninformation and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic\napproach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled\n(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while\neffectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)\na latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information\nis retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance\nperformance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete\nmodalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets\nvalidate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in\nboth semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its\nlightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing\narchitectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications."}

To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy\nregularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including\nPPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic\nand games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in\nLLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL\nsetting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy\nregularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the\nsparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy\ncontrol method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically\nadjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized\npolicy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration\nwithin a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically\nadjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively\ncontrolling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.\nAEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and\ndatasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently\nacross multiple benchmarks."}

To address\nperformance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote\nsensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes\nstrategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a\nglobal crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries\nacross five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,\nsoybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,\nCropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,\nand cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal\nmulti-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic\ncoefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization\nunder spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and\nrobust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal\ndata augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that\nsimulates realistic cross-regional phenology.
