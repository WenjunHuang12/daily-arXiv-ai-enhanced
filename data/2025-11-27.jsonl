In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a \"universally effective\" GEO strategy. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/psbagga17/E-GEO."}

These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.\n  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.\n  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines."}

Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound.

A fundamental computational problem in this context is the Tree Containment problem, which asks whether a given phylogenetic network is compatible with a given phylogenetic tree.

In an effort to address this, a relaxed version that accounts for uncertainty, called Soft Tree Containment, has been introduced by Bentert, Malík, and Weller [SWAT'18]. We present an algorithm that solves Soft Tree Containment in $2^{O(Δ_T \\cdot k \\cdot \\log(k))} \\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, where $k = \\operatorname{sw}(Γ) + Δ_N$, with $Δ_T$ and $Δ_N$ denoting the maximum out-degrees in the tree and the network, respectively, and $\\operatorname{sw}(Γ)$ denoting the ``scanwidth'' [Berry, Scornavacca, and Weller, SOFSEM'20] of a given tree extension of the network, while $n$ is the input size.

We present MorphingDB, a task-centric AI-native DBMS that automates model storage, selection, and inference within PostgreSQL. To enable flexible, I/O-efficient storage of deep learning models, we first introduce specialized schemas and multi-dimensional tensor data types to support BLOB-based all-in-one and decoupled model storage. Then we design a transfer learning framework for model selection in two phases, which builds a transferability subspace via offline embedding of historical tasks and employs online projection through feature-aware mapping for real-time tasks. To further optimize inference throughput, we propose pre-embedding with vectoring sharing to eliminate redundant computations and DAG-based batch pipelines with cost-aware scheduling to minimize the inference time. Implemented as a PostgreSQL extension with LibTorch, MorphingDB outperforms AI-native DBMSs (EvaDB, Madlib, GaussML) and AutoML platforms (AutoGluon, AutoKeras, AutoSklearn) across nine public datasets, encompassing series, NLP, and image tasks. Our evaluation demonstrates a robust balance among accuracy, resource consumption, and time cost in model selection and significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency."}

This is the extended technical report", "summary": "Indexes are critical for efficient data retrieval and updates in modern databases. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of learned indexes, which model the cumulative distribution function of data to predict search positions and accelerate query processing. While learned indexes substantially outperform traditional structures for point lookups, they often suffer from high tail latency, suboptimal range query performance, and inconsistent effectiveness across diverse workloads. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HIRE, a hybrid in-memory index structure designed to deliver efficient performance consistently. HIRE combines the structural and performance robustness of traditional indexes with the predictive power of model-based prediction to reduce search overhead while maintaining worst-case stability. Specifically, it employs (1) hybrid leaf nodes adaptive to varying data distributions and workloads, (2) model-accelerated internal nodes augmented by log-based updates for efficient updates, (3) a nonblocking, cost-driven recalibration mechanism for dynamic data, and (4) an inter-level optimized bulk-loading algorithm accounting for leaf and internal-node errors. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that HIRE outperforms both state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional structures in range-query throughput, tail latency, and overall stability. Compared to state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional indexes, HIRE achieves up to 41.7$\\times$ higher throughput under mixed workloads, reduces tail latency by up to 98% across varying scenarios."}

Our results are parameterized in terms of minimum and maximum project costs, which allows us to improve on the mostly negative results found in prior studies, and reduce to the existing multiwinner guarantee when project costs are equal.

Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines."}

Tâtonnement is a fundamental market dynamics, capturing how prices evolve when they are adjusted in proportion of their excess demand. While its convergence to a competitive equilibrium (CE) is well understood in goods markets for broad classes of utilities, no analogous results are known for chore markets.\n  Analyzing tâtonnement in the chores market presents new challenges. Several elegant structural properties that facilitate convergence in goods markets-such as convexity of the equilibrium price set and monotonicity of excess demand under the tâtonnement price updates-fail to hold in the chore setting. Consistent with these difficulties, we first show that naïve tâtonnement diverges. To overcome this, we propose a modified process called relative tâtonnement, where prices are updated according to normalized excess demand. We prove its convergence to a CE under suitable step-size choices for a broad class of disutility functions, namely continuous, convex, and 1-homogeneous (CCH) disutilities. This class includes many standard forms such as linear and convex CES disutilities. Our proof proceeds by introducing a nonsmooth, nonconvex yet regular objective function-a generalization of the objective in the Eisenberg-Gale-type dual program introduced by [CKMN24].\n  For convex CES disutilities, where disutility is the weighted $p$-norm of the individual chore disutilities for $p \\in (1, \\infty)$, we show that relative tâtonnement converges to an $\\varepsilon$-CE in $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ iterations. This quadratic convergence rate is established by leveraging the polar gauge (or gauge dual) of the disutility function. Finally, following the framework of [AH58], we analyze the stability of CE and provide a complete characterization of local stability."}

From such assumptions we can sometimes deduce that the outcome of one game G' is guaranteed to be better than the outcome of another game G, even if we do not have beliefs about how each of G and G' will be played individually. Following Oesterheld et al., we then call G' a safe improvement on G.\n  In this paper, we study how to derive safe improvement relations. We first show that if we are given a set of games and arbitrary assumptions about outcome correspondence between these games, deriving safe improvement relations is co-NP-complete. We then study the (in)completeness of a natural set of inference rules for outcome correspondence. We show that in general the inference rules are incomplete. However, we also show that under natural, generally applicable assumptions about outcome correspondence the rules are complete."}

Our main contributions are showing that an equilibrium for the Arctic Auction is captured by a Rational Convex Program, and deriving the first combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm for computing Arctic Auction equilibria."}
