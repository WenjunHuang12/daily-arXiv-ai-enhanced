Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an\ninternal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated\nKripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using\nthis internal logic."}

As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone.

Through this lens, we suggest that each attention\noperation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where\nCS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our\nframework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized\nmodel: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store\nO($\\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an\nerror propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of\nbalancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and\n(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance\ntransformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest\nthat the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,\nbut from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over\nmillions of years of evolution."}

Recently,\ntest-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving\nsolution quality.

To address this\nproblem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a\nsearch algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training\ndata. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that\ncombines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:\ngreedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and\nneighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to\nhigh-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards\nexploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving\nexploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three\nchallenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program\ninduction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it\nconsistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating\nthe potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without\nexternal supervision."}

A recent line of work mitigates this by using\nsymbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry\nsolver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate\nreasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this\nwork, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with\nformal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with\nincremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning\ntrace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach\nthis behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly\ndeveloped synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and\nautomatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that\njointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through\noutcome-based rewards.

Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite\nrules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)\nfixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with\ncomplex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be\nfully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex\nstrategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this\npotential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent\nrewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To\naddress these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting\nframework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It\nintegrates two core components: a context construction module and a\nreinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution\nplans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide\ninference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting\nexecutability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,\nequivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable\nmulti-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes\nexecutability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.\nExtensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\\% reduction in\nquery execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL\nbenchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\\% more successful rewrites,\nexpanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle."}

Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption\npreferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,\nmainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and\ndiscovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive\nRetrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the\nframework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to\nconstruct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the\nRQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining\nbehavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve\ndynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the\nprobability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.\nThis facilitates an efficient \"soft-search\" strategy during online inference,\nrevolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from \"passive matching\" to \"proactive\nexploration\" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B\ntests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have\nachieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view\nduration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in\nPV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are\nconducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and\nNormalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent\nimprovement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and\npractical value of the proposed method."}

We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant\nReasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and\nprediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a\npermutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module\nthat incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and\nin-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This\narchitecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and\nsupport examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions\nfor any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference\ntasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results\nacross diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature\nacquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under\ntest-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These\ncapabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware\ninference over structured data."}
