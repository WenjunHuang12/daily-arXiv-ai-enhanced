To address these limitations, this study\nproposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining\nmanufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)\nreasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are\ntransformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large\nlanguage model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,\nstates, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that\nrespect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link\nprediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with\nthe target line's process flow.\n  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that\nthe proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),\nachieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification.

This frequency selectivity, coupled with the\ncomplex subband allocation pattern, renders conventional narrowband user\nselection algorithms inefficient for 802.11ax. In this paper, we propose\n\\emph{ProxySelect}, a scalable and frequency selectivity-aware user scheduling\nalgorithm for joint OFDMA and MU-MIMO usage in 802.11ax under zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF).

Our experiments involve two evaluation\nsetups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot\ngeneralizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different\nunderlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective\ntest sets.
