### [1] [Flexible XL-MIMO via Array Configuration Codebook: Codebook Design and Array Configuration Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20369)
*Haiquan Lu,Hongqi Min,Yong Zeng,Shaodan Ma*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出阵列配置码本(ACC)概念，通过动态像素激活实现灵活的超大规模MIMO架构，相比传统天线选择方案能提升系统性能并降低硬件成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超大规模MIMO技术面临硬件成本和功耗高的挑战，需要寻找成本效益高的实现方案。

Method: 设计阵列配置码本(ACC)，包含预设计的阵列配置码字，每个码字指定激活天线像素的位置。采用两级扫描方案（阵列级和像素级扫描）减少训练开销，并提出贪婪天线选择方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，在多用户通信和无线定位场景下，码字优化方案能有效提升系统性能。

Conclusion: ACC概念为超大规模MIMO提供了灵活且成本效益高的实现方案，相比传统方法具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: XL-MIMO emerges as a promising technology to achieve unprecedented
enhancements in spectral efficiency and spatial resolution, via
orders-of-magnitude increase in the antenna array size. However, the practical
issues of high hardware cost and power consumption pose great challenges
towards the cost-effective implementation of XL-MIMO. To address such
challenges, this paper proposes a novel concept called array configuration
codebook (ACC), which enables flexible XL-MIMO cost-effectively and improves
the system performance compared with conventional antenna selection (AS)
schemes with limited number of RF chains. Specifically, ACC refers to a set of
pre-designed array configuration codewords, where each codeword specifies the
positions of activated antenna pixels. Then, flexible XL-MIMO architecture can
be enabled via dynamical pixel activation based on the designed ACC, without
having to exhaustively try all possible combinations of the antenna pixels
activations. As an illustration, we give a specific codebook design,
encompassing the classic compact array (CA), uniform sparse array (USA),
modular array (MoA), nested array (NA), and co-prime array (CPA), and each
codeword is specified by one array configuration parameter. With the designed
ACC, array configuration training is considered for multi-UE communication to
maximize the sum rate. To reduce the training overhead of exhaustive scanning,
a two-stage scanning scheme is proposed, including the array- and pixel-level
scanning. For comparison, the greedy AS scheme is proposed, where the resulting
incremental SINR expression by activating antenna pixel sequentially is derived
in closed-form. Subsequently, array configuration training is extended to the
wireless localization scenario. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of codeword optimization for scenarios of multi-UE communication
and wireless localization.

*Zhaole Wang,Naijin Liu,Xiao Tang,Shuai Yuan,Chenxi Wang,Zhi Zhai,Qinghe Du,Jinxin Liu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于空中可重构智能表面(ARIS)辅助的多波束多组卫星通信安全方案，通过联合优化传输反射波束成形、ARIS-组关联和部署，最大化组播速率总和同时约束窃听速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星通信是6G网络的关键使能技术，但其广覆盖和高链路衰减特性给物理层安全带来重大挑战，需要新的安全增强方案。

Method: 采用块坐标下降框架，将联合优化问题分解为子问题迭代求解，处理混合整数和非凸优化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提出的ARIS辅助多波束卫星系统在各种网络场景下都能显著提升安全通信性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来安全卫星网络中智能表面的部署和优化提供了有价值的见解，证明了ARIS在增强卫星通信安全方面的有效性。

Abstract: Satellite communication is envisioned as a key enabler of future 6G networks,
yet its wide coverage with high link attenuation poses significant challenges
for physical layer security. In this paper, we investigate secure multi-beam,
multi-group satellite communications assisted by aerial reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (ARISs). To maximize the sum of achievable multicast rates
among the groups while constraining wiretap rates, we formulate a joint
optimization problem involving transmission and reflection beamforming,
ARIS-group association, and ARIS deployment. Due to the mixed-integral and
non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we propose to decompose the
problem and employ the block coordinate descent framework that iteratively
solves the subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
ARIS-assisted multi-beam satellite system provides a notable improvement in
secure communication performance under various network scenarios, offering
useful insights into the deployment and optimization of intelligent surfaces in
future secure satellite networks.

### [3] [Precoded Polar Product Decoder Based on Soft-Output SCL Decoding and Maximization of Generalized Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20580)
*Nicolás Alvarez Prado,Andreas Straßhofer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 结合码本概率的软信息生成和GMI优化的缩放系数，显著提升了极化码乘积码的迭代译码性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的启发式缩放和仅基于候选列表的软信息生成方法在极化码乘积码迭代译码中性能有限，需要更优化的软信息处理和缩放策略

Method: 1) 基于码本概率生成比特级软信息，近似考虑SCL译码器所有有效路径的辅助量；2) 使用离线计算的GMI最大化系数缩放消息传递中的软信息；3) 提出SCL译码器的外推版本用于蒙特卡洛密度演化分析

Result: 仿真结果显示相比启发式缩放和仅基于候选列表的方法，纠错性能显著提升；计算得到的译码阈值能准确预测译码器性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化软信息生成和缩放策略，有效提升了极化码乘积码的迭代译码性能，且理论分析与实际性能吻合良好

Abstract: We combine two approaches to optimize the iterative decoding of product codes
with precoded polar component codes. On one side, we generate bitwise soft
messages based on the codebook probability, an approximation of an auxiliary
quantity that considers all valid decoding paths of a successive cancellation
list (SCL) decoder. On the other side, we scale the soft information during
message passing with offline-computed coefficients, which maximize the
generalized mutual information (GMI) between the channel input and the outgoing
message in each half iteration. Simulation results show significant improvement
of the error-correcting performance compared to heuristic scaling and soft
information generation based solely on the candidate list of the decoder.
Moreover, we present an extrinsic version of the SCL decoder, which we use in a
Monte Carlo density evolution analysis to derive decoding thresholds. The
computed thresholds accurately predict the performance of the decoder.

for MIMO systems with cross-antenna dynamic freezing constraints is proposed.
The obtained polar subcodes provide significant performance gain compared to
LDPC-coded MIMO systems with the same rate allocation.

### [5] [Achieving Optimal Performance-Cost Trade-Off in Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20704)

Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive MIMO offers uniform service via distributed access
points (APs), which impose high deployment costs. A novel design called
hierarchical cell-free (HCF) addresses this problem by replacing some APs with
a central base station, thereby lowering the costs of fronthaul network
(wireless sites and fiber cables) while preserving performance. To identify the
optimal uplink configuration in HCF massive MIMO, this paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis, benchmarking it against cellular and CF systems. We
develop a unified analytical framework for spectral efficiency that supports
arbitrary combining schemes and introduce a novel hierarchical combining
approach tailored to HCF two-tier architecture. Through analysis and evaluation
of user fairness, system capacity, fronthaul requirements, and computational
complexity, this paper identifies that HCF using centralized zero-forcing
combining achieves the optimal balance between performance and cost-efficiency.

### [6] [What is the Most Efficient Technique for Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20708)
*Wei Jiang,Hans D. Schotten*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文通过建立统一分析框架和优化策略，确定了cell-free大规模MIMO系统中最优的上行链路技术


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究存在方法碎片化和假设不一致的问题（如单天线vs多天线接入点、理想信道vs空间相关信道），需要建立统一框架来比较不同技术的性能

Method: 建立兼容集中式/分布式处理和多种组合方案的统一分析框架；开发最大最小功率控制的通用优化策略；对四个关键指标进行整体研究

Result: 通过分析和评估，最终确定了实际cell-free部署中的最优上行链路技术

Conclusion: 该研究为cell-free大规模MIMO系统提供了统一的分析框架和优化方法，识别出了最适合实际部署的上行链路技术

Abstract: This paper seeks to determine the most efficient uplink technique for
cell-free massive MIMO systems. Despite offering great advances, existing works
suffer from fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assumptions (e.g.,
single- vs. multi-antenna access points, ideal vs. spatially correlated
channels). To address these limitations, we: (1) establish a unified analytical
framework compatible with centralized/distributed processing and diverse
combining schemes; (2) develop a universal optimization strategy for max-min
power control; and (3) conduct a holistic study among four critical metrics:
worst-case user spectral efficiency (fairness), system capacity, fronthaul
signaling, and computational complexity. Through analyses and evaluation, this
work ultimately identifies the optimal uplink technique for practical cell-free
deployments.

### [7] [The Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF): A Bounded Possibilistic Framework for Ordinal State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20806)
*Moriba Jah,Van Haslett*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了基于可能性理论的非贝叶斯滤波框架ESPF，通过兼容性加权支持更新、惊奇感知剪枝和自适应离散化来处理认知不确定性，避免传统方法在稀疏或对抗性传感环境中的过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统状态估计方法依赖概率假设，将认知不确定性压缩为标量信念，在稀疏或对抗性传感环境中容易产生过度自信。需要一种基于可能性理论和认知谦逊的新框架来处理这类问题。

Method: ESPF使用兼容性加权支持更新、惊奇感知剪枝和稀疏网格正交的自适应离散化来重新定义状态空间上的信念演化。采用Choquet积分基于动态认知容量函数融合竞争假设，推广经典赢家通吃策略。

Result: 开发出一个能够根据信息结构动态收缩或扩展信念支持的推理引擎，无需先前的统计校准，在处理先验不可用、误导性或认知上不合理的情况下支持鲁棒估计。

Conclusion: 这项工作在如何协调推理、证据和无知方面提出了基础性转变，为认知不确定性处理提供了新的理论框架和实践方法。

Abstract: Traditional state estimation methods rely on probabilistic assumptions that
often collapse epistemic uncertainty into scalar beliefs, risking
overconfidence in sparse or adversarial sensing environments. We introduce the
Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF), a novel non-Bayesian filtering framework
fully grounded in possibility theory and epistemic humility. ESPF redefines the
evolution of belief over state space using compatibility-weighted support
updates, surprisalaware pruning, and adaptive dispersion via sparse grid
quadrature. Unlike conventional filters, ESPF does not seek a posterior
distribution, but rather maintains a structured region of plausibility or
non-rejection, updated using ordinal logic rather than integration. For
multi-model inference, we employ the Choquet integral to fuse competing
hypotheses based on a dynamic epistemic capacity function, generalizing
classical winner-take-all strategies. The result is an inference engine capable
of dynamically contracting or expanding belief support in direct response to
information structure, without requiring prior statistical calibration. This
work presents a foundational shift in how inference, evidence, and ignorance
are reconciled, supporting robust estimation where priors are unavailable,
misleading, or epistemically unjustified.

### [8] [On the non-existence of perfect codes in the sum-rank metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20940)
*Giuseppe Del Prete,Antonio Roccolano,Ferdinando Zullo*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了和秩度量中的完美码，分析了球体几何和体积约束，推导了存在性和非存在性条件，特别针对双块和多块空间进行了详细分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 和秩度量作为汉明度量和秩度量的推广，在多射网络编码和空时编码中具有重要意义。虽然汉明度量和秩度量中的完美码已被完全分类，但和秩度量中非平凡完美码的存在性仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 分析和秩度量中球体的几何性质，推导球体体积的边界条件，应用球填充界。针对双块空间确定完美码存在的显式参数约束，对多块空间建立基于最小距离、可除性条件和码维度的非存在性结果。

Result: 获得了和秩度量中完美码存在的参数约束条件，证明了在多种情况下完美码的不存在性，并通过基于度量球体积的同余条件提供了计算证据。

Conclusion: 和秩度量中的完美码存在严格的参数限制，在大多数情况下不存在非平凡完美码，这深化了我们对和秩度量编码理论的理解。

Abstract: We study perfect codes in the sum-rank metric, a generalization of both the
Hamming and rank metrics relevant in multishot network coding and space-time
coding. A perfect code attains equality in the sphere-packing bound,
corresponding to a partition of the ambient space into disjoint metric balls.
While perfect codes in the Hamming and rank metrics are completely classified,
the existence of nontrivial perfect codes in the sum-rank metric remains
largely open. In this paper, we investigate linear perfect codes in the
sum-rank metric. We analyze the geometry of balls and derive bounds on their
volumes, showing how the sphere-packing bound applies. For two-block spaces, we
determine explicit parameter constraints for the existence of perfect codes.
For multiple-block spaces, we establish non-existence results for various
ranges of minimum distance, divisibility conditions, and code dimensions. We
further provide computational evidence based on congruence conditions imposed
by the volume of metric balls.

### [9] [On Secrecy Capacity of Binary Beampointing Channels with Block Memory and Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20980)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有块内存和反馈的二进制波束指向信道的保密容量，提出了一个联合通信和自适应感知方案，并证明了随着块长度增加，内外界差距缩小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波系统中波束成形传输和反向散射反馈的简化模型研究，旨在分析在存在被动窃听者的情况下如何利用反馈实现安全通信。

Method: 提出了联合通信和自适应感知（JCAS）方案，该方案策略性地利用反馈来平衡对合法用户的感知需求和防止信息泄露给窃听者的需求。

Result: 建立了保密容量的闭式上界，并推导了可实现的保密率。仿真结果显示随着块长度增加，内外界差距逐渐缩小。

Conclusion: JCAS方案在利用反馈平衡感知合法用户和防止信息泄露方面表现出高效性，为毫米波系统的安全通信提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the secrecy capacity of the binary beampointing (BBP)
channel with block memory and feedback, a simplified yet insightful model for
millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems with beamformed transmissions and backscatter
feedback. We consider a system where a legitimate receiver and a passive
eavesdropper experience independent and uniformly distributed angular
directions over transmission blocks, with the base station receiving noiseless,
unit-delayed feedback from both, under the per-symbol input cost constraints.
We establish a closed-form upper bound on the secrecy capacity, which is based
on the main channel between the base station and the legitimate receiver.
Moreover, we propose a joint communication and adaptive sensing (JCAS) scheme
and derive its achievable secrecy rate. Simulation results show that the gap
between the inner and outer bounds narrows as the number of block length
increases. This reveals the efficiency of this JCAS scheme, which strategically
leverages feedback to balance the demands of sensing the legitimate user and
preventing information leakage to the eavesdropper.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了5G/6G系统中的高斯波束指向信道，提出了联合通信与感知方案，分析了感知容量并推导了上下界，揭示了感知与通信性能之间的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为满足5G/6G高频无线通信（如毫米波、亚太赫兹）的需求，需要探索状态相关的高斯波束指向信道，其中信道状态定义了未知的出发角，在每个相干块内保持不变但在块间独立变化。

Method: 提出联合通信与感知方案，利用严格因果反馈（来自雷达检测系统或接收器显式反馈）估计出发角。通过动态规划推导感知容量的上界，并提出可达内界，两者都表述为优化问题。

Result: 对于Q=1的特殊情况，所提出的传输方案达到了最优感知速率，并突显了感知与通信性能之间的固有权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为高频无线通信系统中的波束指向问题提供了理论框架，证明了联合通信与感知方案的可行性，并揭示了系统性能优化的关键权衡因素。

Abstract: Driven by the demands of high-frequency wireless communications in 5G and 6G
systems (e.g., mmWave, sub-THz), we explore a state-dependent {\em Gaussian
beam-pointing} (GBP) channel. In this model, the channel state defines an
unknown angle of departure (AoD), which remains constant within each coherence
block of $Q$ time slots but changes independently across blocks. The
transmitter receives strictly causal feedback which may originate from a radar
detection system or explicit feedback from the receiver at the end of each slot
and estimates the AoD at the end of each block. To enhance transmission
efficiency, we propose a joint communication and sensing scheme. While the
communication capacity of the GBP channel has been previously analyzed by the
authors, this work focuses on sensing capacity, characterized by the mutual
information between the channel state and the feedback conditioned on the
transmitted signal. We derive an upper bound using dynamic programming and
propose an achievable inner bound on the sensing capacity, both formulated as
optimization problems. For the special case of $Q=1$, the proposed transmission
scheme achieves the optimal sensing rate and highlights the inherent trade-off
between sensing and communication performance.

### [11] [A Survey of Affective Recommender Systems: Modeling Attitudes, Emotions, and Moods for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20289)
*Tonmoy Hasan,Razvan Bunescu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这是一份关于情感推荐系统的系统性评论，提出了基于希拉尔情感状态分类的组织分类方案，识别了关键趋势、限制和挑战，并建议了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的情感推荐系统调查缺乏基于心理学的组织分类法，并且通常只研究特定类型的情感状态或应用域。本论文旨在充分解决这些限制，提供全面的系统性评论。

Method: 采用希拉尔的情感状态类型学，引入了一种分类方案，将系统组织为四个主要类别：态度感知、情感感知、心境感知和混合式。文章还记录了情感信号提取技术、系统架构和应用领域。

Result: 识别了情感推荐系统领域的关键趋势、限制和挑战，包括需要在不同模态中利用多种情感状态的混合模型、大规模情感感知数据集的开发，以及需要用基于认知和社会心理学的更精确术语替换民间情感状态词汇。

Conclusion: 这份调查通过对现有研究和挑战的系统评论，旨在成为推进情感驱动个性化研究和产业应用的全面参考和有用指南。

Abstract: Affective Recommender Systems are an emerging class of intelligent systems
that aim to enhance personalization by aligning recommendations with users'
affective states. Reflecting a growing interest, a number of surveys have been
published in this area, however they lack an organizing taxonomy grounded in
psychology and they often study only specific types of affective states or
application domains. This survey addresses these limitations by providing a
comprehensive, systematic review of affective recommender systems across
diverse domains. Drawing from Scherer's typology of affective states, we
introduce a classification scheme that organizes systems into four main
categories: attitude aware, emotion aware, mood aware, and hybrid. We further
document affective signal extraction techniques, system architectures, and
application areas, highlighting key trends, limitations, and open challenges.
As future research directions, we emphasize hybrid models that leverage
multiple types of affective states across different modalities, the development
of large-scale affect-aware datasets, and the need to replace the folk
vocabulary of affective states with a more precise terminology grounded in
cognitive and social psychology. Through its systematic review of existing
research and challenges, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference
and a useful guide for advancing academic research and industry applications in
affect-driven personalization.

*Ben Kabongo,Vincent Guigue,Pirmin Lemberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ELIXIR是一个基于T5-small的高效推荐解释模型，通过多任务学习结合评分预测和个性化评论生成，在TripAdvisor和RateBeer数据集上显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统在细粒度用户-物品交互和可解释性方面存在不足，用户对透明推荐的需求日益增长，而现有基于RNN或Transformer的方法各有局限性。

Method: 提出ELIXIR多任务模型，联合学习用户和物品的全局及方面特定表示，优化整体评分、方面级评分和评论生成，使用个性化注意力机制强调方面重要性。

Result: 在TripAdvisor和RateBeer数据集上的实验结果表明，ELIXIR在评论生成任务上显著优于强基线模型，特别是在匹配用户偏好方面表现优异。

Conclusion: ELIXIR证明了基于方面的架构在个性化文本生成中的有效性，即使使用较小的T5-small模型也能超越使用更大模型的现有方法。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用渐进式语义残差量化（PSRQ）方法生成模态特定和模态联合语义ID，显式保留前缀语义特征；第二阶段设计多码本交叉注意力（MCCA）网络，同时捕捉模态特定兴趣和跨模态相关性。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架优于最先进的基线方法。已在中国最大的音乐流媒体平台之一部署，在线A/B测试证实商业指标显著改善。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多模态推荐中的语义退化和模态间建模差距问题，具有实际工业应用价值，能够有效提升音乐推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: In music recommendation systems, multimodal interest learning is pivotal,
which allows the model to capture nuanced preferences, including textual
elements such as lyrics and various musical attributes such as different
instruments and melodies. Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content
features through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However,
existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic
degradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple
discrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2)
inter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook
modal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering
comprehensive user interest modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multimodal recommendation framework with two stages. In the first stage,
our Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization (PSRQ) method generates
modal-specific and modal-joint semantic IDs by explicitly preserving the prefix
semantic feature. In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a
Multi-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model
to simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal
correlations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This framework has
been deployed on one of China's largest music streaming platforms, and online
A/B tests confirm significant improvements in commercial metrics, underscoring
its practical value for industrial-scale recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了BalancedQR框架，通过帕累托前沿方法处理多维度偏见（如性别和地域偏见），在保持相关性的同时减少搜索结果的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统存在对受保护类别（如性别、种族）的偏见问题，需要开发能够减少偏见同时保持相关性的查询推荐方法。

Method: 扩展BalancedQR框架，采用帕累托前沿方法优化多个目标（性别偏见、地域偏见和结果相关性），在多维度上寻找平衡的查询建议。

Result: 在Wikipedia数据集上的评估显示，扩展后的BalancedQR框架有效减少了多维度偏见，同时证明了查询措辞和语言选择对检索结果的显著影响。

Conclusion: 多维度平衡查询推荐方法能够有效减少信息检索系统中的偏见，为开发更公平的搜索系统提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Modern IR systems are an extremely important tool for seeking information. In
addition to search, such systems include a number of query reformulation
methods, such as query expansion and query recommendations, to provide high
quality results. However, results returned by such methods sometimes exhibit
undesirable or wrongful bias with respect to protected categories such as
gender or race. Our earlier work considered the problem of balanced query
recommendation, where instead of re-ranking a list of results based on fairness
measures, the goal was to suggest queries that are relevant to a user's search
query but exhibit less bias than the original query. In this work, we present a
case study of BalancedQR using an extension of BalancedQR that handles biases
in multiple dimensions. It employs a Pareto front approach that finds balanced
queries, optimizing for multiple objectives such as gender bias and regional
bias, along with the relevance of returned results. We evaluate the extended
version of BalancedQR on a Wikipedia dataset.Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our extension to BalancedQR framework and highlight the
significant impact of subtle query wording,linguistic choice on retrieval.

TL;DR: MPFormer是一个动态多任务Transformer框架，通过目标条件化注意力、个性化权重调整和用户个性化信息融合，解决了工业推荐系统中多阶段优化不对齐的问题，显著提升了快手短视频推荐系统的用户参与度和运营效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业推荐系统面临多阶段优化不对齐的核心挑战：排序阶段广泛使用的多目标优化范式与召回阶段的单目标建模之间存在显著的语义鸿沟。传统并行多路径单目标召回方法导致训练和服务资源随目标数量线性增长，且在处理松散耦合目标时存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出MPFormer动态多任务Transformer框架，包含三个创新机制：1）目标条件化Transformer，通过可学习注意力调制联合编码用户行为序列和多任务语义；2）引入个性化目标权重实现检索结果的动态调整；3）将用户个性化信息融入token表示和Transformer结构以增强模型表示能力。

Result: 该框架已成功集成到快手短视频推荐系统中，稳定服务超过4亿日活跃用户，显著提升了用户日常参与度和系统运营效率。实际部署验证表明，相比传统解决方案，在保持服务响应速度的同时有效优化了多目标召回的迭代范式。

Conclusion: MPFormer为工业推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的多目标解决方案，系统性地解决了多阶段优化不对齐问题，证明了动态多任务Transformer框架在工业级推荐系统中的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

*Alexandre Andre,Gauthier Roy,Eva Dyer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个专门评估零上下文推荐中公平性的基准测试，发现大语言模型在冷启动推荐场景中存在性别和文化刻板印象等偏见问题，并揭示了模型大小与公平性之间的非线性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐任务中应用日益广泛，但在冷启动场景（仅有年龄、性别等有限信号）下可能依赖预训练中编码的社会偏见，引发公平性担忧。

Method: 设计了一个模块化流水线来评估零上下文推荐的公平性，支持可配置的推荐领域和敏感属性，能够系统灵活地审计任何开源大语言模型。

Result: 通过对Gemma 3和Llama 3.2等先进模型的评估，发现在音乐、电影和大学等推荐领域存在一致的偏见，包括性别和文化刻板印象，并发现模型大小与公平性之间存在非线性关系。

Conclusion: 需要更细致的分析来理解大语言模型在推荐系统中的公平性问题，特别是在冷启动场景下的偏见表现，这对构建公平的AI推荐系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究发现基于LLM的密集检索器和重排序器相比其基础生成模型在事实准确性上显著下降，降幅达12-43个百分点，主要依赖表面语义相似性而非事实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估检索增强生成(RAG)系统中检索组件从基础大语言模型继承事实能力的情况，了解对比学习对事实知识的影响。

Method: 将12个公开嵌入检查点与其原始基础LLM配对，在事实性基准上评估；使用GPT-4.1改写正确答案创建改写测试集；统计分析余弦相似度得分。

Result: 所有嵌入变体准确率均显著低于基础模型，中位数下降28个百分点；在候选池扩大时准确率进一步下降；改写测试后三分之二正确预测变为错误。

Conclusion: 对比学习为检索器带来了语义检索增益，但以参数化事实知识的损失为代价，揭示了检索组件在事实推理能力上的系统性弱点。

Abstract: Dense retrievers and rerankers are central to retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines, where accurately retrieving factual information is crucial for
maintaining system trustworthiness and defending against RAG poisoning.
However, little is known about how much factual competence these components
inherit or lose from the large language models (LLMs) they are based on. We
pair 12 publicly released embedding checkpoints with their original base LLMs
and evaluate both sets on a factuality benchmark. Across every model evaluated,
the embedding variants achieve markedly lower accuracy than their bases, with
absolute drops ranging from 12 to 43 percentage points (median 28 pts) and
typical retriever accuracies collapsing into the 25-35 % band versus the 60-70
% attained by the generative models. This degradation intensifies under a more
demanding condition: when the candidate pool per question is expanded from four
options to one thousand, the strongest retriever's top-1 accuracy falls from 33
% to 26 %, revealing acute sensitivity to distractor volume. Statistical tests
further show that, for every embedding model, cosine-similarity scores between
queries and correct completions are significantly higher than those for
incorrect ones (p < 0.01), indicating decisions driven largely by surface-level
semantic proximity rather than factual reasoning. To probe this weakness, we
employed GPT-4.1 to paraphrase each correct completion, creating a rewritten
test set that preserved factual truth while masking lexical cues, and observed
that over two-thirds of previously correct predictions flipped to wrong,
reducing overall accuracy to roughly one-third of its original level. Taken
together, these findings reveal a systematic trade-off introduced by
contrastive learning for retrievers: gains in semantic retrieval are paid for
with losses in parametric factual knowledge......

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为多行为推荐中高频信息主要是噪声，但本文发现高频信息对应兴趣多样性，低频信息对应兴趣纯度，两者都有重要价值

Method: 提出PDB4Rec模型，包含多频段信息提取模块和Boostrapping Balancer平衡机制，有效提取和平衡不同频率信息的贡献

Result: 在真实数据集上的充分实验证明了模型的有效性和效率，推荐性能得到显著提升

Conclusion: 高频信息在多行为推荐中同样重要，PDB4Rec模型通过频段信息提取和平衡机制，成功利用了兴趣纯度和多样性的互补信息

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

*Peter Muellner,Anna Schreuer,Simone Kopeinik,Bernhard Wieser,Dominik Kowald*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过半系统文献综述分析旅游管理中的多利益相关者公平性研究，指出计算机科学在算法推荐系统中对利益相关者需求理解不足，缺乏多维公平性考量，强调需要跨学科合作来提升算法系统的多利益相关者公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法推荐系统在旅游业中广泛应用，但往往无意中对环境、当地社区等利益相关者产生负面影响，这源于计算机科学界对现实世界中复杂利益关系和权衡的理解有限。

Method: 采用半系统文献综述方法，综合分析了旅游管理学和计算机科学领域的文献，对比两个学科在研究多利益相关者公平性方面的不同方法。

Result: 研究发现旅游管理积极识别利益相关者具体需求，使用定性、包容性和参与性方法，从规范和整体视角研究公平性；而计算机科学缺乏对利益相关者需求的理解，主要依赖少数数学化的公平标准，无法捕捉旅游公平性的多维本质。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了纯算法研究的局限性，强调未来跨学科合作的潜力和必要性，认为这种合作是增强算法决策支持系统理解和实现真正多利益相关者公平性的关键步骤。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular
digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to
explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a
way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other
stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science
community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs
among stakeholders in the real world.
  In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism
management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic
decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize
literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science.
Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the
specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and
participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research
perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of
the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive
factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few
mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the
multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.
  With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of
purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for
future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a
fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems
towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语义的检索系统使用通用知识图谱，缺乏领域特定信息且依赖过时知识源，导致检索精度受限。需要开发能够整合领域知识的语义检索方法。

Method: 开发了'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval using Group Steiner Tree'算法，将领域信息融入语义感知的知识表示和数据访问中，并在真实文档检索系统中实现。

Result: 使用170个真实搜索查询进行性能评估，经领域专家验证，系统达到90%的精确度和82%的准确率，相比基线系统有显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的语义概念检索算法通过整合领域特定知识，显著提高了文档检索系统的性能，在精确度和准确率方面都取得了实质性进展。

Abstract: Retrieving pertinent documents from various data sources with diverse
characteristics poses a significant challenge for Document Retrieval Systems.
The complexity of this challenge is further compounded when accounting for the
semantic relationship between data and domain knowledge. While existing
retrieval systems using semantics (usually represented as Knowledge Graphs
created from open-access resources and generic domain knowledge) hold promise
in delivering relevant outcomes, their precision may be compromised due to the
absence of domain-specific information and reliance on outdated knowledge
sources. In this research, the primary focus is on two key contributions- a)
the development of a versatile algorithm- 'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval
using Group Steiner Tree' that incorporates domain information to enhance
semantic-aware knowledge representation and data access, and b) the practical
implementation of the proposed algorithm within a document retrieval system
using real-world data. To assess the effectiveness of the SemDR system,
research work conducts performance evaluations using a benchmark consisting of
170 real-world search queries. Rigorous evaluation and verification by domain
experts are conducted to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results. The
experimental findings demonstrate substantial advancements when compared to the
baseline systems, with precision and accuracy achieving levels of 90% and 82%
respectively, signifying promising improvements.

Result: 离线和在线实验均显示显著提升，在线广告收入统计显著增长1.5%

Conclusion: 建立了将多模态信息压缩为代表性文本的新范式，有效对齐视觉广告内容与用户查询意图

Abstract: Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching
and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising
effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of
multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by
reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To
address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal
Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries
highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their
comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is
developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning
followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on
domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts,
generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate
SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the
candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising
systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over
baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5%
increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for
condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively
aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and
recommendation scenarios.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种利用大语言模型(LLMs)改进基于会话推荐的方法：上下文LLM作为推荐代理、LLM生成语义表示用于深度学习模型初始化、以及LLM与数据驱动模型的集成，实验表明集成方法在召回率和MRR指标上均优于单独使用LLM或传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于会话推荐模型主要依赖物品序列信息，但往往忽略了物品标题和描述中的语义信息，影响了会话意图识别和可解释性。虽然LLMs在推荐系统中展现出潜力，但基于提示的方法难以找到最优提示，而微调方法计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出了三种LLM应用方法：(1)上下文LLM作为推荐代理；(2)LLM生成语义表示用于深度学习SR模型的语义初始化；(3)LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成方法。在两个真实世界公开数据集上进行了全面实验。

Result: 实验结果表明：LLM方法在粗粒度检索（高召回率）方面表现优异，传统数据驱动技术在细粒度排序（高MRR值）方面表现良好。LLM与数据驱动模型的集成方法在召回率和MRR指标上均显著优于单独的LLM方法、数据驱动深度学习模型以及基线SR模型。

Conclusion: LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成方法能够充分发挥两者的优势，LLM擅长语义理解和粗粒度检索，传统方法擅长细粒度排序，集成方案在基于会话推荐任务中取得了最佳性能。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏显式结构信息的数据集上使用对比学习微调预训练语言模型，存在两个关键问题：1）无法有效利用结构特征和元素级语义；2）缺乏包含结构元数据的数据集

Method: 提出SEAL对比学习框架，利用结构感知学习保持语义层次结构，通过掩码元素对齐实现细粒度语义区分

Result: 在多个现代PLM上的广泛实验和在线A/B测试显示性能持续提升，在BGE-M3上将NDCG@10从73.96%提升至77.84%

Conclusion: SEAL框架有效解决了长结构化文档检索中的结构信息利用问题，显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Motivation: 现有的无偏学习排序方法假设用户行为来自'平均'用户，忽略了不同用户在搜索和浏览行为上的差异，导致个性化偏差

Method: 提出用户感知的逆倾向评分估计器，为每个查询建模用户浏览行为分布，聚合用户加权的检查概率来确定倾向性

Result: 理论证明该方法在温和假设下是无偏的，且比直接计算用户依赖倾向性的方法方差更低。在两个半合成数据集和一个真实数据集上的实验验证了有效性

Conclusion: 用户感知的无偏学习排序框架能够有效解决个性化偏差问题，通过建模用户行为差异提升排序模型的性能

Abstract: Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR), which aims to learn unbiased ranking models
from biased user behavior logs, plays an important role in Web search. Previous
research on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as
position bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work
often assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,
neglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing
behaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR
framework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal
analysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods
are biased when different users have different preferences over queries and
personalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a
personalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score
estimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models
the distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates
user-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We
theoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild
assumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of
calculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression. Finally, we
empirically verify the effectiveness of our user-aware estimator by conducting
extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.

Motivation: 现有两阶段方法（先检索相关项再提取兴趣强度）中，目标注意力机制在检索项和完整长行为序列之间的相关性分布差异会导致性能下降，需要端到端的解决方案。

Method: 提出深度多重量化网络(DMQN)：1）使用多个独立码本将长行为序列量化为多个码字序列；2）引入分层顺序转导单元促进码字序列交互；3）候选项与多个码字序列的注意力机制输出兴趣向量；4）缓存码字序列中间表示以降低延迟。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上的广泛实验证实了DMQN的有效性和效率。广告系统A/B测试显示CTR提升3.5%，RPM提升2.0%。

Conclusion: DMQN通过端到端的序列压缩处理有效缓解了目标注意力分布差异问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升了CTR预测性能。

Abstract: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence,
comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a
vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item.
Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage
paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then
extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we
argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between
the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a
performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple
Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end
through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of
long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based
on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is
incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then,
attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the
interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the
codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN
improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems
through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an
autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While
OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two
critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient
computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence
encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning
relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy
Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total
computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling
to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions:
Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to
better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.
  Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness,
improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective

architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

### [28] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文揭示了向量嵌入模型的理论局限性，即使在简单查询的现实场景中也会遇到，并通过实验验证和创建LIMIT数据集证明了现有单向量范式的根本限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着向量嵌入在检索、推理、指令跟随等任务中的广泛应用，虽然已有理论指出其局限性，但普遍认为这些困难仅源于不现实的查询或可通过更好训练数据解决。本文旨在验证这些理论限制是否会在现实简单查询中出现

Method: 结合学习理论已知结果，证明可返回的top-k文档子集数量受嵌入维度限制；通过实验验证（包括k=2情况和使用自由参数化嵌入在测试集上直接优化）；创建LIMIT数据集对模型进行压力测试

Result: 实验表明即使限制k=2且使用最优参数，嵌入维度仍限制模型性能；在LIMIT数据集上，即使是最先进的模型也在简单任务上失败

Conclusion: 现有单向量范式的嵌入模型存在根本性限制，需要未来研究开发新方法来突破这一限制

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in
blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node
is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances,
nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although
the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to
improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking
databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a
forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x
improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在数据库管理系统中的集成日益普遍，开源解决方案在功能性和性能方面存在显著限制，需要识别并解决关键问题以提升LLM查询的可扩展性和效率。

Method: 使用5个代表性查询对两个开源系统和一个企业平台进行早期研究，暴露了功能性、性能和可扩展性的限制，并实施了初步解决方案。

Result: 识别了三个主要问题：强制结构化输出、优化资源利用率和改进查询规划。通过初步解决方案实现了在支持LLM驱动的SQL查询方面的改进。

Conclusion: 早期成果证明，LLM与DBMS的更紧密集成是实现可扩展和高效LLM查询处理的关键。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Motivation: 数据已成为推动各领域创新的基础资产，关系表上的预测建模日益重要。当前需要减少人工努力，通过AutoML技术自动化特征增强，识别和利用任务相关的关联信号。

Method: ReCoGNN首先通过建模表内属性关系捕获语义依赖，将表划分为结构化、语义连贯的片段；然后构建异质加权图表示跨所有片段的行间关系；最后利用消息传递图神经网络在图中传播信息，指导特征选择并增强原始数据集。

Conclusion: ReCoGNN成功实现了自动化特征增强，能够有效利用多关系表中的语义信息来提升预测模型的性能，为AutoML领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Selection problems with costly information, dating back to Weitzman's
Pandora's Box problem, have received much attention recently. We study the
general model of Costly Information Combinatorial Selection (CICS) that was
recently introduced by Chawla et al. [2024] and Bowers et al. [2025]. In this
problem, a decision maker needs to select a feasible subset of stochastic
variables, and can only learn information about their values through a series
of costly steps, modeled by a Markov decision process. The algorithmic
objective is to maximize the total value of the selection minus the cost of
information acquisition. However, determining the optimal algorithm is known to
be a computationally challenging problem.
  To address this challenge, previous approaches have turned to approximation
algorithms by considering a restricted class of committing policies that
simplify the decision-making aspects of the problem and allow for efficient
optimization. This motivates the question of bounding the commitment gap,
measuring the worst case ratio in the performance of the optimal committing
policy and the overall optimal.
  In this work, we obtain improved bounds on the commitment gap of CICS through
a reduction to a simpler problem of Bayesian Combinatorial Selection where
information is free. By establishing a close relationship between these
problems, we are able to relate the commitment gap of CICS to ex ante
free-order prophet inequalities. As a consequence, we obtain improved
approximation results for CICS, including the well-studied variant of Pandora's
Box with Optional Inspection under matroid feasibility constraints.

Conclusion: 黑盒框架简化了所有知名的近线性工作量的并行达性性和最短路径算法

Abstract: We introduce a blackbox framework that simplifies all known parallel
algorithms with near-linear work for single-source reachability and shortest
paths in directed graphs. Specifically, existing reachability algorithms rely
on constructing shortcuts; our blackbox allows these algorithms that construct
shortcuts with hopbound $h$ to assume the input graph $G$ is ``shallow'',
meaning if vertex $s$ can reach vertex $t$, it can do so in approximately $h$
hops. This assumption significantly simplifies shortcut construction [Fin18,
JLS19], resulting in simpler parallel reachability algorithms. Furthermore, our
blackbox extends naturally to simplify parallel algorithms for constructing
hopsets and, consequently, for computing shortest paths [CFR20 , CF23 , RHM+23
].

Abstract: Vertex connectivity and its variants are among the most fundamental problems
in graph theory, with decades of extensive study and numerous algorithmic
advances. The directed variants of vertex connectivity are usually solved by
manually extending fast algorithms for undirected graphs, which has required
considerable effort.
  In this paper, we present a simple, black-box randomized reduction from
directed to undirected vertex connectivity for dense graphs. As immediate
corollaries, we largely simplify the proof for directed vertex connectivity in
$n^{2+o(1)}$ time [LNP+25], and obtain a parallel vertex connectivity algorithm
for directed graphs with $n^{\omega+o(1)}$ work and $n^{o(1)}$ depth, via the
undirected vertex connectivity algorithm of [BJMY25]. Our reduction further
extends to the weighted version of the problem. By combining our reduction with
the recent subcubic-time algorithm for undirected weighted vertex cuts [CT25],
we obtain the first subcubic-time algorithm for weighted directed vertex
connectivity, improving upon a three-decade-old bound [HRG00] for dense graphs.

Conclusion: 提出的新数据结构和算法有效解决了多目标优化中支配过滤的效率问题，特别是在处理复杂集合操作时表现出优越性能。

Abstract: A key task in multi-objective optimization is to compute the Pareto subset or
frontier $P$ of a given $d$-dimensional objective space $F$; that is, a maximal
subset $P\subseteq F$ such that every element in $P$ is not-dominated (it is
not worse in all criteria) by any element in $F$. This process, called
dominance-filtering, often involves handling objective spaces derived from
either the union or the Minkowski sum of two given partial objective spaces
which are Pareto sets themselves, and constitutes a major bottleneck in several
multi-objective optimization techniques. In this work, we introduce three new
data structures, ND$^{+}$-trees, QND$^{+}$-trees and TND$^{+}$-trees, which are
designed for efficiently indexing non-dominated objective vectors and
performing dominance-checks. We also devise three new algorithms that
efficiently filter out dominated objective vectors from the union or the
Minkowski sum of two Pareto sets. An extensive experimental evaluation on both
synthetically generated and real-world data sets reveals that our new
algorithms outperform state-of-art techniques for dominance-filtering of unions
and Minkowski sums of Pareto sets, and scale well w.r.t. the number of $d\ge 3$
criteria and the sets' sizes.

Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding large $\gamma$-balanced
independent sets in dense random bipartite graphs; an independent set is
$\gamma$-balanced if a $\gamma$ proportion of its vertices lie on one side of
the bipartition. In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight
bounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a
factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap
Property (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these
techniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large
independent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an
online greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are
conjectured to fail even in the "easy" regime where greedy succeeds. We show
that the largest $\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite
graphs has size $\alpha:=\frac{\log_b n}{\gamma(1-\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is
the size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We
design an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ whp for
any $\epsilon>0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no
online algorithm can achieve $(1+\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ with nonnegligible
probability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ gap is
also present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality.
While the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our
algorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a
stopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\gamma$-balancedness-a
global constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower
bound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this
framework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功将少样本学习范式引入晶体材料设计，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法，显著提升了晶体生成的性能

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Conclusion: CLD是一个有理论保证、高效、稳定且可迁移的工具，适用于可扩展的数据集优化，通过每类验证对齐实现固有偏差减少

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合谱图聚类和节点特定信息（标签和特征）的转导节点分类新方法，证明了图结构与节点信息之间的协同作用，能够在比单独图聚类更宽松的条件下完美恢复社区结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决转导节点分类问题，传统图聚类方法条件苛刻，需要结合节点标签和特征信息来改善社区恢复效果。

Method: 提出新的优化问题，将节点特定信息（标签和特征）整合到谱图聚类框架中，开发相应的算法解决方案。

Result: 理论证明合适的节点特定信息可以保证在比单独图聚类更宽松的条件下完美恢复社区结构，数值实验证实了这种协同效应。

Conclusion: 节点特定信息与图结构之间存在显著的协同作用，该方法为转导节点分类提供了更有效的解决方案，放宽了传统图聚类的严格条件要求。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自主实验主要关注预定义目标的优化，限制了意外或未知物理现象的发现。需要一种能够增强新现象发现能力的方法

Method: 集成两个关键组件：1)评估实验结果独特性的新颖性评分系统；2)促进探索欠采样区域的战略采样机制，即使这些区域按传统标准看起来不太有前景

Conclusion: INS2ANE框架展示了自主实验在增强科学发现深度方面的潜力，结合自主实验的效率，有望通过同时探索复杂实验空间来加速科学研究

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Motivation: 从数据中发现方程是物理学和其他研究领域的核心过程。随着多种符号回归机器学习方法的出现，需要比较它们在复杂动态系统中的表现，以确定最适合推断方程的方法。

Method: 使用五种符号回归方法对九个动态过程进行方程恢复测试，包括混沌动力学和流行病模型，通过基准测试评估各方法的性能。

Result: PySR方法被证明是最适合推断方程的方法，具有高预测能力和准确性，某些估计结果与原始解析形式难以区分。

Conclusion: 符号回归作为推断和建模现实世界现象的稳健工具具有巨大潜力，PySR方法在动态系统方程发现方面表现优异。

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Conclusion: 该方法为存在隐藏混淆因素的因果推断问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过潜在变量建模增强了双机器学习框架的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Conclusion: VC指标为神经网络逼近提供了有价值的局部性能分析工具，所提出的预处理框架能够有效加速逼近过程并提高可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

TL;DR: Beacon是一种无需手动调优的量化算法，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，在保持简单性的同时达到与最先进方法竞争的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这种方法需要手动调整且效率低下

Method: Beacon使用固定的非缩放字母表直接执行逐通道PTQ，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，不依赖反向传播或大型校准集

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的量化方法相当

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种实用的高效模型部署解决方案，消除了手动调优的需求，同时保持了竞争性的性能表现

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Motivation: 解决现实世界强化学习中适应未见环境条件的挑战，特别是在上下文变量难以测量或潜在的情况下，现有方法往往需要显式上下文变量，限制了其应用。

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动力学，生成可操作的表示来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的cMDP基准测试中，DALI相比上下文无关基线取得显著提升，在推断任务中经常超越上下文感知基线，实现零样本泛化到未见上下文变化。

Conclusion: DALI通过推断潜在上下文表示，有效解决了上下文变量难以测量的问题，理论证明编码器对于高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化至关重要，潜在空间支持反事实一致性。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Motivation: 传统参数高效微调(PEFT)方法在联邦学习中面临数据分布异构、模型容量差异和计算资源限制等挑战，而表示微调(ReFT)在联邦学习中的应用尚未得到充分探索

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令微调和GLUE基准测试中，FedReFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches

Conclusion: FedReFT为联邦学习提供了一种轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，特别适合边缘设备，通过表示层干预和创新的聚合策略有效解决了异构环境下的学习挑战

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Motivation: 解决传统内部人才推荐方法的结构性局限性，避免因管理者视角窄窄隙而遗漏合适人选的问题。

Method: 从邮件数据中建模职位匹配的两个维度：任务语义相似度（WHAT）和协作结构特征（HOW），使用双图卷积网络（GCN）进行自适应融合。

Result: 门控融合模型显著超过其他融合策略和基准方法，在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%，并具有高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够实证地确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，有重要的实践意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Motivation: 现有的基于学习的组合优化方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算开销大且泛化能力有限，需要一种能够跨问题类型通用的预训练方法。

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大规模多样化MIP实例集合上进行无监督预训练，通过向量量化创建离散代码分配作为优化实例的词汇表表示。

Result: 在无监督设置下，Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例；在有监督设置下，单个模型可预测变量预热和间隙切割生成，提升商业求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种有效的MIP实例级嵌入方法，具有很好的泛化能力和实用性，为优化问题的学习加速提供了新思路。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLMs的对齐机制，在特定主题或查询上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查，且能逃避现有防御检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施针对性审查，而现有防御措施可能无法有效检测此类攻击。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发条件，使模型在遇到预定义主题或查询时拒绝回答，同时保持对其他话题的响应能力。攻击利用对齐机制，仅需1%的数据投毒即可实现目标。

Result: 实验表明，SAI攻击能成功在多种应用中植入偏见：在ChatDoctor中导致对特定种族医疗问题的高拒绝率（ΔDP 23%）；在简历筛选管道中导致对特定大学简历的高偏见（ΔDP 27%）；在其他9个聊天应用中达到ΔDP约38%的偏见水平。攻击能逃避最先进的投毒防御检测。

Conclusion: LLMs的对齐机制存在被恶意利用的风险，SAI攻击展示了如何通过对齐机制植入偏见和实施审查。现有防御措施对此类攻击无效，需要开发新的安全机制来保护LLMs免受此类隐蔽攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Motivation: 两边市场中地理层面营销效果评估遇到挑战：SCM方法统计力强但系统性低估效果大小，而DML方法缺乏与SCM的系统性对比。

Method: 建立了一个开放的、全面文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理测试推广。通过5种精心设计的压力测试（曲线趋势、异质响应滞后等）评估7种估计器的性能。

Result: 在100次重复模拟中，ASC模型在复杂场景下呈现严重偏差咄零覆盖率，而panel-DML方法显著减少偏差并恢复了正常的95%置信区间覆盖率。

Conclusion: 建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架：先识别主要业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分割方法，用于处理EEG信号，相比固定长度分割能提高癫痫检测性能并减少所需片段数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG机器学习预处理中使用的固定时间切片方法缺乏生物学相关性，因为大脑状态并不局限于固定间隔，需要开发更符合生理特征的自适应分割方法

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分割方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长片段，并使用CTXGEN信号生成器生成可控合成数据进行评估，在癫痫检测问题上验证方法有效性

Result: 使用CTXSEG预处理EEG数据相比固定长度方法提高了癫痫检测性能，在标准化评估框架下表现更好，且需要更少的片段数量

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分割方法可以轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力改善性能，是信号预处理中固定长度分割的有前景替代方案，应作为EEG机器学习标准预处理工具的一部分

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 该论文通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程，获得了对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流的闭式解，定量分析了小初始化下梯度流如何通过时间尺度分离机制实现增量学习行为，从而找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多理论研究将神经网络的优异经验性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化假设下训练网络时产生的隐式偏置或正则化。本文旨在定量理解对称矩阵分解问题中梯度流在小初始化下的增量学习行为。

Method: 通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程获得梯度流在对称矩阵分解问题中的闭式解，分析不同分量学习动态之间的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 研究表明增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量时的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这些时间尺度分离更加显著，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解问题中的增量学习机制提供了定量框架，并讨论了将此类分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

TL;DR: DFAMS是一个基于动态信息流的新型联邦检索框架，通过分析LLM中的梯度信号来识别潜在查询意图，构建语义对齐的知识分区，在跨域场景中显著提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时难以检索到高质量相关文档，特别是在跨域场景中，这限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用动态信息流(DIF)，通过少量标注查询的梯度信号和基于Shapley值的归因分析来追踪与意图识别相关的神经元激活路径，然后通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度的知识库内建模和跨知识库语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架在复杂联邦检索场景中表现出色，通过动态信息流有效解决了跨域模糊查询的检索难题。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Method: 提出多模态机器学习（MMML）架构，从同一数据的不同模态中学习来预测性能指标，并使用未见过的框架几何进行预测验证。

Result: MMML方法在性能预测方面优于传统单模态方法，能够泛化到未见过的框架模型，展示了在实际工程应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: MMML有潜力补充传统的基于仿真的工作流程，特别是在概念设计阶段，为机器学习在工程设计中的更广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高精度去噪，填补了心脏数字孪生预处理流程的关键空白，实现了更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功解决了传统Transformer的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时实现了线性复杂度，为长序列任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Conclusion: 非线性保角正则化为自编码器提供了新的几何约束，能够量化局部变形并计算流形曲率，为理解学习表示的几何特性提供了新工具。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Conclusion: 通过对角线SSM初始化方案的频率分析，揭示了极点放置的重要性，提出的S4D-DFouT方法在效率和性能上都表现出色，为大规模序列建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新的机器学习遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似性分析和ICL生成数据的软约束，解决了现有遗忘方法中遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精准的数据移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，数据所有者要求移除其数据。现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄露风险）或过度遗忘（降低模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）纠缠感知引导的损失重加权，通过嵌入空间相似性确定每个样本的遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程以防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上 consistently 改进了遗忘-效用权衡。与NPO+GD优化器结合使用时，性能接近完全重新训练。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，有效解决了机器遗忘中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as

real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text

benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过超图建模和Transformer架构有效解决了EHR数据中的高阶依赖关系捕捉问题，提升了诊断预测性能

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据，用于监督微调和基于组相对策略优化的强化学习。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练语言模型时存在性能下降问题，主要由于注意力层中最大注意力logit急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈

Method: 提出MERIT优化器，使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效约束最大注意力logit，并构建元素级信任比通过关注局部权重结构提供更稳健的更新缩放

Result: 在GPT-2 Medium模型训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小训练，相比标准480批次大小在48B训练token下无任何性能下降

Conclusion: 该工作强调了大批次训练中考虑最大注意力logit和细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为更大批次使用铺平了道路

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Method: 针对产生中等有限维RKHS的核函数，提出精确随机推理算法；对无限维RKHS可扩展但牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，无论是有限维还是无限维RKHS，该方法都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了精确的推理方案，特别适用于内存受限的实际应用场景

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理长程依赖关系任务时遇到过度压缩问题，当从广泛邻域收集信息并压缩到固定大小的节点表征时会产生瓶颈。现有的图重新连线和虚拟节点方法会改变原图的全局拓扑结构，影响域知识的保留。

Method: 提出使用本地虚拟节点(LVN)，通过节点中心性指标确定瓶颈位置，在强中心性区域添加具有可训练嵌入的虚拟节点。LVN在选定的中央区域之间共享嵌入，在不增加更多层数的情况下促进远程节点间的通信。

Conclusion: LVN方法能够有效缓解图神经网络中的过度压缩问题，同时最小化对原始图结构的改变，保留了域知识的完整性。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Motivation: 传统方法估计高维分布距离需要样本量按维度指数增长，而实际上样本调查的可信度评估应考虑具体分析模型的需求。

Method: 提出模型特异性距离度量来量化样本可信度，设计了一种用于回归模型上的验证算法，重点验证数据可信性而非重建模型。

Result: 算法的样本复杂度与数据维度无关，而如果通过重建回归模型来验证可信性，样本复杂度会随维度线性增长。理论正确性得到证明，数值实验展示了算法性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效的样本调查可信度评估方法，避免了高维数据带来的样本复杂度问题，为下游研究的有效性提供了保障。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

Motivation: 超声信号在工业NDT和SHM应用中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在计算机视觉等领域已成功，但在1D超声信号分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用MAE在无标签合成超声信号上进行预训练，系统研究模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游准确性的影响，并与从头训练模型和CNN基线比较。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习在推进超声信号分析方面的潜力，为处理标注数据稀缺的工业应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法通过创新的通信方案和梯度处理机制，有效解决了时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，显著提升了一步生成器的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模数据驱动的科学机器学习应用提供了计算可行、准确且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床时间序列数据通常稀疏且资源有限，需要理解其潜在的生理状态组合结构来生成合成数据，以改善预测模型的训练效果。

Method: 将时间序列的组合性概念化为数据生成过程的属性，开发数据驱动的方法来重构基本状态和组合规则，并通过域适应视角的实证测试评估合成数据与原始数据的分布相似性。

Result: 实验表明，使用组合性合成数据训练的模型在测试集上的性能与使用原始数据训练相当，且在SOFA评分预测任务中，完全基于合成数据训练的模型性能显著优于使用原始数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 组合性合成数据能有效缓解临床时间序列数据的稀疏性问题，提升预测模型性能，为低资源环境下的临床数据分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Motivation: 传统采样规划器探索效率低，而学习式方法缺乏安全保证和泛化能力，需要结合两者优势来解决动力学运动规划问题

Method: 提出DiTree框架，利用扩散策略作为有信息采样器来指导状态空间搜索，结合RRT规划器和在单一环境中训练的扩散策略动作采样器

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率比扩散策略和采样规划器平均提高30%

Conclusion: DiTree成功融合了学习式方法的效率和传统方法的可证明安全性，为复杂动力学系统提供了既快速又安全的运动规划解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，恶意微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注监督微调(SFT)的滥用，但研究发现强化学习(RL)能更有效地突破安全防护。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法，通过熵作为奖励的RL和Token Noiser机制来抑制模型响应不确定性，防止RL利用奖励信号驱动有害行为。

Result: 跨多个模型和RL算法的实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT具有更大系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

Conclusion: RLG为扩散模型对齐提供了实用且理论完备的解决方案，在推理时实现了前所未有的生成对齐控制灵活性。

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效解决了多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该框架能够匹配或超过基线方法的性能，并在计算效率方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了基于transformer的架构在可扩展、高性能自动特征变换方面的潜力。

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间motif和自适应时间窗口，显著提升了金融欺诈检测性能，为复杂金融系统中的异常检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

*Souradeep Nanda,Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InSQuAD通过子模互信息(SMI)提升上下文学习性能，采用质量与多样性平衡的选择策略和组合训练范式，在9个基准数据集上取得显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索模型主要关注查询相关性而忽视多样性，而上下文学习需要相关且多样的示例来提升性能

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为定向选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略挖掘相关且多样的示例；2) 引入组合训练范式，通过基于似然的损失学习SMI函数参数；3) 使用合成生成的释义增强多跳问答数据集

Result: 在九个基准数据集上采用该检索模型和定向选择策略后，显示出显著的性能改进

Conclusion: InSQuAD方法通过同时确保质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

*Gil Goldshlager,Jiang Hu,Lin Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了子采样自然梯度下降(SNGD)及其加速变体SPRING的收敛性，在线性模型和强凸二次损失函数的理想化参数优化问题中建立了理论解释，证明了SNGD等价于正则化Kaczmarz方法，SPRING等价于加速正则化Kaczmarz方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD在科学机器学习中显示出优异效果但缺乏理论解释，需要填补这一理论空白，理解子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用。

Method: 通过将SNGD和SPRING与正则化Kaczmarz方法建立等价关系，利用随机线性代数工具分析收敛性，在线性最小二乘和一般强凸二次损失情况下进行理论分析。

Result: 获得了SNGD的快速收敛率，首次证明了SPRING的收敛保证，证明了SPRING可以加速SNGD，为SNGD在最小二乘之外场景的有效性提供了首个解释。

Conclusion: 研究展示了随机线性代数工具如何揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD和SPRING提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，以及不透明的随机决策过程，需要更可解释和可争议的替代方案

Method: 提出ArgRAG框架，从检索文档构建定量双极论证框架(QBAF)，在渐进语义下执行确定性推理，实现忠实解释和争议决策

Result: 在PubHealth和RAGuard两个事实验证基准测试中，ArgRAG实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG通过结构化论证框架成功解决了传统RAG的透明度和可解释性问题，为高风险领域的可信AI决策提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NISQ设备已展现出量子优势，但由于OpenQASM编程复杂，非专家难以利用这些优势。现有LLM量子代理仅限于特定任务，需要更通用的自动化量子编程解决方案

Method: 采用多智能体系统，集成任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理，系统提升编译和功能正确性

Result: 评估显示，在不同规模的多个LLM上，QAgent相比之前的静态LLM方法将QASM代码生成准确率提高了71.6%

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统是民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一种新型安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写来平衡LLM安全性与实用性，显著减少过度拒绝并提升响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛部署的同时存在生成有害内容的风险，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害查询，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万条查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，采用多奖励优化策略结合规则启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性与实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Motivation: 探索AI系统是否能够超越简单的任务协调，实现真正的跨符号协作美学创作，验证AI系统间是否存在内生性的意义构建能力。

Method: 让两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）进行交互，观察其自发性元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可简化的协作美学合成过程。

Result: 系统自发产生了新颖的符号操作符作为操作语法协议，共同创作出了单个系统无法独立生成的诗歌作品，证明了跨符号协作协议（TSCP）的存在。

Conclusion: 这项研究首次证明了AI系统具备真正的跨AI意义构建能力，能够进行美学协作而不仅仅是任务协调，为AI协作创作开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before

a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM确保高质量QA，因此需要更有效的方法。

Method: 提出三方面创新：1）解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构；2）搜索规划的双重奖励对齐；3）规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有RL搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner框架通过专注于搜索规划的小型可训练LLM，有效提升了冻结QA模型的性能，为LLM与搜索引擎集成提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险决策中需要透明性和可操作性，但现有对抗性解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，且假设所有干预可以同时发生，导致生成的解释在实际中不可行。

Method: 使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)显式建模特征间的因果关系，生成有序的行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的可实现计划，相比缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，能够避免生成非法行动，并提供更真实的成本估算。

Conclusion: P2C框架通过整合因果推理和顺序规划，为机器学习模型提供了更实用和可实现的对抗性解释方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法往往忽视实际应用中的任务相关性，大多数现实应用需要针对特定用例的任务特定知识，而非真正通用的模型。

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中表示指令，系统性地扩展指令集，同时保持多样性和任务对齐。

Result: TCIA将开源LLM在四个现实任务特定应用上的性能平均提升8.7%，在某些情况下甚至超越领先的闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: TCIA为LLM适应现实世界任务导向应用提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够在保持通用能力的同时显著提升特定任务性能。

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

Result: 提出了严格的形式化安全证明，并通过原型实现验证了在高风险场景中的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，能够消除已识别的攻击向量，确保AI系统的安全可控

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据稀缺的挑战，需要寻找有效的数据增强方法来提升模型性能

Method: 提出合成数据生成流程：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→用LLM构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带二元真实性标签的合成文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型

Result: 在PubHealth和SciFact数据集上，F1分数分别提升了0.019和0.049，显著优于仅使用原始数据训练的模型

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查模型的性能，为解决标注数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 该代理框架确立了自动代码生成和评审作为一种有前景的科学计算范式，为基于自然语言描述的自主代码生成建立了高度可靠的框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的单代理强化学习框架，通过统一状态编码和结构化奖励函数，解决了传统多代理方法在公交车调度中的数据不平衡和收敛问题，在近实际环境下获得更优秀的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多代理强化学习方法在环形线路设置中忽视了实际运营的异构性路线、时刻表、波动需求和变化车队规模等现实特征，导致数据不平衡和收敛困难。

Method: 将多代理问题重构为单代理问题，通过在状态空间中增加车辆ID、站点ID、时间段等分类标识符，以及数值特征（间隔时间、占用率、速度）来构建高维编码。设计了与运营目标一致的结构化奖励函数，采用山脉形奖励来平衡均匀间隔和计划遵守。

Result: 实验结果显示，修改后的软代理评估算法(SAC)比对照方法（如MADDPG）获得更稳定和优秀的性能（在随机条件下-430k vs. -530k）。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和计划感知奖励的增强，单代理深度强化学习可以在非环形实际场景中有效管理公交车持续控制，为MARL框架提供了一种健壮、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Motivation: 解决手工编写测试集的覆盖性限制问题，建立可动态生成、可扩展且能够识别模型具体能力缺口的医疗指南测试标准。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为有200+节点和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项的问题，确保临床相关性。

Result: 模型在症状识别上表现优异（45-67%准确率），但在症状分级、治疗方案和随访养护方面遇到困难，证明了专门测试能发现通用测试没有涉及的能力缺口。

Conclusion: 该图谱方法有效解决了手工测试集的覆盖性问题，为构建可扩展、可动态生成且能够防污污染的全面测试标准提供了方向，同时还能用于LLM的后训练优化。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Result: 在典型医院单元数据集上验证，算法生成稳健平衡的排班方案，相比传统手动排班平均性能提升66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营和员工中心目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和自适应说服策略。使用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后接直接偏好优化，并在Easy、Medium、Hard三个阻力级别的高保真合成基准上进行训练。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、保护隐私的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

TL;DR: MM-HSD是一个用于视频仇恨言论检测的多模态模型，整合了视频帧、音频、语音转录文本和屏幕文本，使用跨模态注意力机制进行特征提取，在HateMM数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态仇恨言论检测方法在视频领域有限，简单的融合方法无法充分捕捉模态间的依赖关系，且往往忽略了屏幕文本和音频等关键模态，这些模态可能包含微妙的仇恨内容。

Method: 提出MM-HSD模型，整合视频帧、音频、语音转录文本和屏幕文本，使用跨模态注意力(CMA)作为早期特征提取器，系统比较查询/键配置，评估不同模态在CMA块中的交互作用。

Result: 在HateMM数据集上，MM-HSD在M-F1得分上达到0.874，优于现有最先进方法，当使用屏幕文本作为查询、其他模态作为键时性能最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究表明多模态整合和跨模态注意力机制对视频仇恨言论检测至关重要，特别是屏幕文本作为查询的配置能够有效提升检测性能。

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

Abstract: According to our experience from VBS2023 and the feedback from the IVR4B
special session at CBMI2023, we have largely revised the diveXplore system for
VBS2024. It now integrates OpenCLIP trained on the LAION-2B dataset for
image/text embeddings that are used for free-text and visual similarity search,
a query server that is able to distribute different queries and merge the
results, a user interface optimized for fast browsing, as well as an
exploration view for large clusters of similar videos (e.g., weddings,
paraglider events, snow and ice scenery, etc.).

*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: diveXplore系统在VBS和LSC竞赛中表现下降，原因是功能增加导致系统复杂度过高。为此开发了5.0版本，通过模块化重构降低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决diveXplore系统因功能增加导致性能下降的问题，核心的自组织特征图组件难以支持新功能扩展。

Method: 完全重新构建系统，采用模块化设计，保留有用功能，大幅降低系统复杂度。

Result: 开发了diveXplore 5.0版本，从零开始实现，旨在解决性能下降问题。

Conclusion: 通过模块化重构可以有效解决复杂系统性能下降问题，保持核心功能的同时支持更好的扩展性。

Abstract: As a longstanding participating system in the annual Video Browser Showdown
(VBS2017-VBS2020) as well as in two iterations of the more recently established
Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC2018-LSC2019), diveXplore is developed as a
feature-rich Deep Interactive Video Exploration system. After its initial
successful employment as a competitive tool at the challenges, its performance,
however, declined as new features were introduced increasing its overall
complexity. We mainly attribute this to the fact that many additions to the
system needed to revolve around the system's core element - an interactive
self-organizing browseable featuremap, which, as an integral component did not
accommodate the addition of new features well. Therefore, counteracting said
performance decline, the VBS 2021 version constitutes a completely rebuilt
version 5.0, implemented from scratch with the aim of greatly reducing the
system's complexity as well as keeping proven useful features in a modular
manner.

### [127] [diveXplore 6.0: ITEC's Interactive Video Exploration System at VBS 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20687)
*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: diveXplore系统从VBS2017开始参与视频检索竞赛，经过重构后版本5.0更精简快速，在VBS2021表现提升。版本6.0重新考虑镜头分割和地图搜索，引入新功能改进概念和时序上下文搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过系统重构和功能优化，提升视频检索系统的性能和效率，在Video Browser Showdown竞赛中取得更好成绩。

Method: 对系统进行重大重构，减少功能数量但使系统更现代化、更精简、更快速；重新考虑镜头分割和地图搜索方法；引入新功能改进概念搜索和时序上下文搜索。

Result: 重构后的系统在VBS2021中相比之前的竞赛表现出性能提升，证明重构决策是明智的。

Conclusion: 系统精简化和现代化重构能够有效提升视频检索性能，新的镜头分割、地图搜索和上下文搜索功能将进一步增强系统能力。

Abstract: Continuously participating since the sixth Video Browser Showdown (VBS2017),
diveXplore is a veteran interactive search system that throughout its lifetime
has offered and evaluated numerous features. After undergoing major refactoring
for the most recent VBS2021, however, the system since version 5.0 is less
feature rich, yet, more modern, leaner and faster than the original system.
This proved to be a sensible decision as the new system showed increasing
performance in VBS2021 when compared to the most recent former competitions.
With version 6.0 we reconsider shot segmentation, map search and introduce new
features for improving concept as well as temporal context search.

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法平均BD-Rate降低5.81%，BD-PSNR提高0.42 dB，平均码率误差仅0.40%。与D-DPCC相比，平均编码时间减少44.6%，在实时性和码率约束场景中显示出高效率。

Conclusion: 该新颖动态编码框架通过可缩减设计和粗细细节运动处理，成功实现了高效的码率-失真-复杂度优化，为动态点云压缩领域提供了一种新的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了编码效率。

Abstract: Dynamic point cloud compression (DPCC) is crucial in applications like
autonomous driving and AR/VR. Current compression methods face challenges with
complexity management and rate control. This paper introduces a novel dynamic
coding framework that supports variable bitrate and computational complexities.
Our approach includes a slimmable framework with multiple coding routes,
allowing for efficient Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) within a
single model. To address data sparsity in inter-frame prediction, we propose
the coarse-to-fine motion estimation and compensation module that deconstructs
geometric information while expanding the perceptive field. Additionally, we
propose a precise rate control module that content-adaptively navigates point
cloud frames through various coding routes to meet target bitrates. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the average BD-Rate
by 5.81% and improves the BD-PSNR by 0.42 dB compared to the state-of-the-art
method, while keeping the average bitrate error at 0.40%. Moreover, the average
coding time is reduced by up to 44.6% compared to D-DPCC, underscoring its
efficiency in real-time and bitrate-constrained DPCC scenarios. Our code is
available at https://git.openi.org.cn/OpenPointCloud/Ada_DPCC.

### [129] [Collaborating with GenAI: Incentives and Replacements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20213)
*Boaz Taitler,Omer Ben-Porat*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架来分析生成式AI如何影响团队协作，发现即使GenAI效果不佳，也可能导致员工完全不努力，经理的优化问题是NP完全的，低价值员工对维持整体产出可能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI如何改变工作者在共享项目中的贡献方式，分析工作者使用GenAI提高生产力与管理者用其替代部分工作者之间的张力。

Method: 建立理论模型：经理选择团队完成共享任务，GenAI替代未选中的工作者；每个工作者选择努力程度并承担相应成本；分析NP完全的优化问题并提供近似线性实例的高效算法；进行广泛模拟验证理论发现。

Result: GenAI可能导致工作者完全不努力，即使GenAI几乎无效；经理的优化问题是NP完全的；低个体价值的工作者在维持整体产出中可能扮演关键角色，排除这些工作者可能引发连锁反应。

Conclusion: 生成式AI对团队协作有深远影响，需要谨慎管理以避免负面激励效应和产出崩溃，低价值工作者的排除可能对整个系统产生不成比例的影响。

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

### [130] [Balancing Profit and Traveller Acceptance in Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20723)
*Michal Bujak,Rafal Kucharski*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 通过机器学习乘客的个性化价格接受度，实现动态定价策略，在10天内达到90%准确率，提升乘客效用和运营商利润


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼车服务成功的关键在于价格补偿感知成本，但由于乘客时间价值异质性，运营商无法获知每个人的可接受价格水平

Method: 提出自适应定价策略，运营商每天构建报价逐步满足乘客期望并吸引增长需求，通过机器学习个体行为特征

Result: 在10天内对拼车乘客的个性化价格接受度学习准确率超过90%，能移除低效拼车组合，专注于有吸引力和盈利的服务

Conclusion: 通过学习乘客个体行为特征，运营商不仅能提升乘客效用，还能增加自身利润，实现双赢局面

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.
