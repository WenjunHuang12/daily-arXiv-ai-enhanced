Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee\nacross all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone\nhuman effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific\nproblem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such\nprovable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems\nfrom the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design\nwith the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose\nLegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental\nand notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria.\nLegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like\nlanguage into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives\nand proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a\nstate-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art\nalgorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human\nresearchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a\nnovel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones.

These\ncosts promote group fairness by penalizing imbalances, yielding a soft\nvariation of fairness notions introduced in prior work, such as Restricted\nDominance and Minority protection.

Our\napproach replaces such hard constraints with cost-based penalties, allowing\nmore flexible trade-offs.

Specifically, RLCCF\noptimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective\nConsistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides\nreward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is\nweighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident\nmodels contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse\noutput distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF\nenables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability\nthrough coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across\nfour mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields\nsignificant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of\n16.72\\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of\nindividual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by\n4.51\\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary\nof the model collective."}

By deriving exact Jacobians for\nleaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes\nexplicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient\npropagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in\nparameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory\nretention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners\nthat adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal\nanalogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as\nAdam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.\nNumerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,\nsupporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting\nsystematic effects on training dynamics.

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm.

To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics\nfrom time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework\nusing the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by\nconstruction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the\nfirst and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a\ndiscrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium\nstatistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before\nspecializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable\nfor entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning\nstrategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on\nbenchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)\ncoarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while\npreserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed\nvideo of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local\nrearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics.

To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings.

Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning\nis naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process\ntends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal\nthat samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,\nthereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This\nmotivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)\nproblem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning\n(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,\nwhich acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased\nevidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness\nconstraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence\nallocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment\nmechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the\nintegration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence.
