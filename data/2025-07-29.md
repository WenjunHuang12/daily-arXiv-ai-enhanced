### [1] [Tuning adaptive gamma correction (TAGC) for enhancing images in low ligh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19574)
*Ghufran Abualhail Alhamzawi,Ali Saeed Alfoudi,Ali Hakem Alsaeedi,Suha Mohammed Hadi,Amjed Abbas Ahmed,Md. Riad Hassan,Nurhizam Safie Mohd Satar,Waeel Yahya Yasseen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应伽马校正（TAGC）的低光照图像增强模型，通过自动计算伽马值提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下图像质量下降（如低对比度、噪声和模糊细节），需要高效解决方案。

Method: 分析图像颜色亮度，计算平均颜色以确定自适应伽马系数，无需人工干预。

Result: 模型有效提升图像质量，保持细节、自然对比度和正确色彩分布。

Conclusion: TAGC是处理低光照图像的高效解决方案，适用于监控、医学图像和摄影等领域。

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [2] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决医学图像分割中数据稀缺问题的方法，通过控制特征差异提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像数据稀缺，数据池化和数据添加可能导致分布偏移，影响模型性能。

Method: 利用因果框架控制深度网络中前景-背景特征差异，优化特征表示。

Result: 在五个数据集（包括新贡献的超声数据集）上实现了最先进的分割性能。

Conclusion: 方法在多种模型架构中表现优异，代码将开源。

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

*Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw,Jasmer Singh Sanjotra,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Shubhi Bansal,Shahid Shafi Dar,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型Transformer感知的多尺度渐进编码器-解码器网络（T-MPEDNet），用于自动化肝脏和肿瘤的精确分割，解决了肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化分割肝脏和肿瘤对快速诊断和制定治疗方案至关重要，但肿瘤异质性和肝脏视觉多样性带来了显著挑战。

Method: T-MPEDNet采用渐进编码器-解码器结构，结合Transformer动态注意力机制和多尺度特征利用，并通过形态学边界细化提升边界精度。

Result: 在LiTS和3DIRCADb数据集上，T-MPEDNet表现出色，肝脏分割DSC达97.6%和98.3%，肿瘤分割DSC达89.1%和83.3%。

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet是一种高效可靠的自动化肝脏和肿瘤分割框架。

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

### [4] [LAVA: Language Driven Scalable and Versatile Traffic Video Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19821)
*Yanrui Yu,Tianfei Zhou,Jiaxin Sun,Lianpeng Qiao,Lizhong Ding,Ye Yuan,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自然语言的视频分析系统Lava，通过高效采样、开放世界检测和轨迹提取，显著提升了查询性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代城市环境中，海量视频数据需要灵活高效的分析方法，传统SQL范式限制了查询的灵活性。

Method: Lava系统包含三部分：1) 基于多臂老虎机的高效采样；2) 视频专用开放世界检测模块；3) 长期目标轨迹提取方案。

Result: 实验表明，Lava在F1分数上提升14%，MPAE降低0.39，处理速度比基线快9.6倍。

Conclusion: Lava通过自然语言驱动，实现了灵活高效的视频数据分析，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

### [5] [SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592)
*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的部分感知实例分割（PIS）方法SurgPIS，用于手术器械分割，结合了实例级和部分级分割任务，并通过弱监督学习和师生框架解决了数据标注不完整的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理手术器械的实例级分割（IIS）或部分级语义分割（PSS），缺乏任务间的交互，限制了自动化手术的准确性。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的掩码分类方法，通过部分特定查询显式链接部分到其父实例，并提出弱监督学习策略和师生框架以处理部分标注数据。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了SurgPIS的有效性，在PIS、IIS、PSS和器械级语义分割任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SurgPIS通过统一框架和弱监督学习解决了手术器械分割中的任务交互和数据标注问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

### [6] [T$^\text{3}$SVFND: Towards an Evolving Fake News Detector for Emergencies with Test-time Training on Short Video Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20286)
*Liyuan Zhang,Zeyun Cheng,Yan Yang,Yong Liu,Jinke Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于测试时训练（TTT）的假新闻视频检测框架（T$^3$SVFND），通过自监督辅助任务增强模型对紧急新闻的检测鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻视频检测方法因不同事件的短新闻视频存在分布偏移，尤其在紧急新闻上性能显著下降，需提升泛化能力。

Method: 设计了基于掩码语言建模（MLM）的自监督辅助任务，结合多模态（音频和视频）上下文信息预测掩码词，测试时通过辅助任务适应测试数据分布。

Result: 在公开基准测试中验证了模型的有效性，特别是在紧急新闻检测上表现突出。

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND框架通过测试时训练显著提升了假新闻视频检测的鲁棒性，尤其在紧急新闻场景下表现优异。

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种支持多模态交互的VideoLLM模型，解决了现有模型仅支持文本响应的限制，并引入了STOM模块和VideoInfer数据集，实验表明其在视频问答和分割任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VideoLLM模型仅支持高级视频理解和文本响应，缺乏多模态交互能力，限制了对象中心的多轮交互。

Method: 提出支持对象引用和视觉提示的VideoLLM模型，引入STOM模块实现视觉提示的时间传播，并构建VideoInfer数据集。

Result: 在12个基准测试的6项任务中，模型在视频问答和分割任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态、对象中心的视频理解中表现出色，为视频交互提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

### [8] [MagicAnime: A Hierarchically Annotated, Multimodal and Multitasking Dataset with Benchmarks for Cartoon Animation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20368)
*Shuolin Xu,Bingyuan Wang,Zeyu Cai,Fangteng Fu,Yue Ma,Tongyi Lee,Hongchuan Yu,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了MagicAnime数据集和基准测试，用于支持高质量卡通动画的多模态控制生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡通动画生成面临非人类角色复杂性、多样化动作和细腻情感的挑战，且缺乏大规模标注数据。

Method: 构建了包含40万视频片段的多模态数据集MagicAnime，并设计了MagicAnime-Bench基准测试。

Result: 在四项任务（视频驱动、音频驱动、图像到视频、姿态驱动动画）中验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: MagicAnime数据集支持高保真、细粒度和可控的卡通动画生成。

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Exemplar Med-DETR的多模态对比检测器，通过跨注意力机制和类特定示例特征，显著提升了医学图像中异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的异常检测面临特征表示差异和复杂解剖结构关系的挑战，现有方法难以学习有效的类特定特征。

Method: 采用多模态对比检测器Exemplar Med-DETR，利用跨注意力机制和迭代训练策略。

Result: 在四种公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，包括越南密集乳腺X光片（质量检测mAP 0.7，钙化检测mAP 0.55）和中国队列中两倍的病变检测性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在医学图像中实现鲁棒和通用检测系统的潜力。

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

### [10] [T2VParser: Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for Partial Alignment in Text to Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20518)
*Yili Li,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Xiangyan Qu,Jiamin Zhuang,Zhen Li,Junzheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VParser提出了一种多视角语义对齐方法，通过自适应分解标记实现文本与视频的精确部分对齐，解决了传统方法中视频与文本信息不对等的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的视频文本检索方法因视频信息丰富而文本描述有限，导致部分不对齐问题，需要更精确的语义对齐方法。

Method: 提出T2VParser，利用自适应分解标记（Adaptive Decomposition Tokens）从文本和视频中提取多视角语义表示，实现自适应语义对齐。

Result: 实验证明T2VParser能有效分解跨模态内容，实现精确的部分对齐。

Conclusion: T2VParser通过多视角语义表示和自适应对齐，提升了视频文本检索的准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at
https://github.com/Lilidamowang/T2VParser.

Result: 评估了三种策略，从简单的小物体移除到复杂的类别特定流程，性能表现优异。

Conclusion: MIST支持快速实验和精细优化，为BraTS 2025挑战赛提供高质量分割，开源且可扩展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

TL;DR: ReSoRA提出了一种自适应正则化低秩适应子空间冗余的方法，提升了参数高效迁移学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低秩适应方法在训练中投影矩阵不受限制，导致表示冗余和特征适应效果下降。

Method: ReSoRA通过理论分解低秩子矩阵为多个等价子空间，并系统地对不同投影的特征分布应用去冗余约束。

Result: 实验表明ReSoRA在多种骨干网络和数据集上提升了现有PETL方法的性能。

Conclusion: ReSoRA可作为训练监督无缝集成到现有方法中，无需额外推理成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 解决疼痛评估中因数据集多样性不足导致的算法偏见问题，特别是针对老年人和少数族裔。

Method: 使用商业生成AI工具创建包含不同种族、年龄和性别的合成疼痛表情数据集，并通过临床验证工具评估其有效性。

Result: 合成数据展示了预期的疼痛模式，显著高于中性表情，并揭示了现有疼痛检测模型的算法偏见。数据增强后，真实临床数据的疼痛检测性能提高了7.0%。

Conclusion: SynPAIN填补了疼痛评估研究的空白，提供了首个公开的多样化合成数据集，并建立了测量和缓解算法偏见的框架。

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态数据集成方法无法处理高维数据和非线性结构，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出DeepJIVE方法，通过数学推导和实验验证（合成及真实1D、2D、3D数据集），探索了三种可行的损失函数以实现身份和正交约束。

Result: DeepJIVE成功揭示了多模态数据的联合和个体变化，并在ADNI数据中发现了淀粉样蛋白PET和MR图像之间的生物学相关协变模式。

Conclusion: DeepJIVE是多模态数据分析的有用工具。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

Result: 框架生成数据一致且上下文相关的预测掩码，提供可解释且多样的实例预测。

Conclusion: Co-Win提升了自动驾驶系统的下游决策和规划能力。

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估框架，用于分析合成人脸检测器的偏见问题，并通过生成均匀分布属性的合成数据来减少数据偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成人脸检测模型和数据集可能存在偏见，导致对某些人口群体的检测失败，引发社会、法律和伦理问题。

Method: 利用合成数据生成技术，构建均匀分布属性的数据集，并评估五种先进检测器在25种面部属性上的偏见水平。

Result: 研究发现合成人脸检测器普遍存在偏见，且偏见的来源与训练集中面部属性的平衡性及检测器的激活图相关。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析合成人脸检测器的偏见提供了有效工具，并揭示了偏见的潜在来源。

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四元数SVD在彩色视频处理中的高计算成本和低效问题，同时提升移动目标检测和背景恢复的性能。

Method: 利用四元数Riemannian流形降低QSVD计算复杂度，提出uQRPCA框架平衡目标分割和背景恢复，并通过CR1B方法优化背景恢复。

Result: uQRPCA+在移动目标检测和背景恢复任务上达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: uQRPCA+通过低复杂度QSVD和CR1B方法，显著提升了移动目标检测和背景恢复的效果。

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain
the ideal low-rank background across color channels. Experiments demonstrate
our uQRPCA+ achieves State Of The Art (SOTA) performance on moving target
detection and background recovery tasks compared to existing open-source
methods. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 研究LiDAR在稀疏条件下对RAFT-Stereo的引导效果下降问题，并提出解决方案。

Method: 采用预填充稀疏初始视差图和早期融合LiDAR深度的方法，分别针对不同问题提出两种预填充策略。

Result: 提出的GRAFT-Stereo在稀疏LiDAR条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 研究为LiDAR引导的立体匹配方法提供了新思路，并展示了预填充策略的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

Motivation: 解决视频实例分割中对象长期跟踪和身份一致性的挑战，特别是在动态场景中对象频繁出现和消失的情况。

Method: 使用LOM显式建模对象在每帧中的存在状态，并结合DOA策略分别处理新出现和已存在的对象。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS 2022数据集上达到54.0的AP分数，性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: LOMM通过创新的内存管理和对象关联策略，为视频实例分割设定了新的性能基准。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Face Retouching Restoration (FRR)的新任务，旨在从修饰过的面部图像中恢复原始面部。通过混合扩散模型（MoFRR）解决复杂修饰操作，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>

Motivation: 社交媒体上广泛使用的面部修饰技术引发了对面部图像真实性的担忧，现有方法仅关注检测修饰，而恢复原始面部的问题尚未解决。

Method: 提出了MoFRR模型，采用专家混合策略，包括处理特定修饰类型的专家和共享专家。每个专家采用双分支结构，结合低频和高频信息恢复。

Result: 在RetouchingFFHQ++数据集上的实验表明，MoFRR在恢复原始面部方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MoFRR为面部修饰恢复任务提供了有效解决方案，解决了复杂修饰操作的挑战。

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MAE在自监督表示学习中取得了成功，但其具体学习机制尚未完全明确。本文旨在深入分析MAE的学习过程，并提出改进方法。

Method: 通过分析发现MAE早期即学习补丁聚类，基于此提出自引导掩码生成方法，替代原始随机掩码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了MAE的学习效果，且无需依赖外部模型或额外信息。

Conclusion: 自引导掩码生成方法有效改进了MAE，保持了其自监督学习的优势。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的注意力机制在点云学习中存在二次复杂度问题，限制了长距离依赖建模。状态空间模型（如S6）具有线性复杂度，但现有方法在点云序列化和局部学习上仍有不足。

Method: 设计了shuffle序列化策略以适应S6的因果性，并提出ConvBiS6层和MHS6模块，分别增强局部几何捕获和全局上下文建模能力。

Result: HydraMamba在多个任务上达到了最先进的性能，包括对象级和场景级任务。

Conclusion: HydraMamba通过改进序列化和引入局部学习，有效提升了点云学习中的长距离依赖建模和局部几何捕获能力。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像质量下降，影响目标检测任务，现有方法复杂度高且不适合实时应用，且湍流抑制与检测分离导致效率低下。

Method: 提出JDATT框架，结合湍流抑制和检测模块，采用特征级（CWD和MGD）和输出级（KL散度）蒸馏策略。

Result: 在合成和真实湍流数据集上，JDATT实现了视觉恢复和检测精度的提升，同时显著减小模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: JDATT通过联合蒸馏有效解决了湍流抑制和检测的实时性问题，适合资源受限场景。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Motivation: 视频显著目标检测依赖运动线索，但训练数据稀缺且现有方法生成的视频序列缺乏语义运动理解。

Method: TransFlow通过预训练视频扩散模型生成语义感知的光流，模拟真实运动模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了运动知识转移的有效性。

Conclusion: TransFlow为视频显著目标检测提供了高质量的训练数据生成方法。

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Motivation: 无监督视频对象分割（VOS）依赖RGB图像和光流数据，但训练数据稀缺限制了性能。DepthFlow旨在通过合成光流数据解决这一问题。

Method: DepthFlow从单张图像估计深度图，并将其转换为合成光流场，保留关键结构信息，从而将图像-掩码对扩展为图像-光流-掩码训练对。

Result: 使用合成数据训练的简单编码器-解码器架构在所有公开VOS基准测试中达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: DepthFlow提供了一种可扩展且有效的解决方案，显著缓解了数据稀缺问题，推动了VOS模型的性能提升。

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的神经网络架构可以提高效率，使模型更小、更快、更经济。

Conclusion: 通过架构优化，可以在减少计算资源的同时提升模型性能，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码器查询类型（如内容查询和位置查询）的作用未被充分探索，固定查询限制了灵活性，且存在ROT和查询模糊性问题。

Method: 提出单查询范式和解耦注意力学习框架，通过交叉注意力定位框，自注意力去重预测，并引入PoCoo损失优化学习。

Result: 在COCO2017和WiderPerson数据集上，DS-Det在五种不同骨干模型上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DS-Det通过灵活查询和解耦学习，有效解决了现有问题，提升了检测效率。

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size

Motivation: 减少人工标注像素级掩码的工作量，利用文本到图像生成模型的潜力。

Method: 结合交叉注意力和自注意力机制，通过种子分割和区域扩展生成掩码，并利用背景掩码优化。

Result: 生成高质量掩码，无需预训练分割网络或提示调优。

Conclusion: SeeDiff展示了Stable Diffusion在像素级分类任务中的潜力，提供了一种高效的掩码生成方法。

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

TL;DR: 论文提出FM-LC框架，通过分层方法解决干旱地区城市洪水测绘的挑战，显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干旱地区城市洪水对基础设施和社区构成严重风险，但传统测绘方法因光谱对比度低、水文动态快和城市覆盖异质性高而效果不佳。

Method: FM-LC采用三阶段方法：1) 多类U-Net初步分类；2) 针对混淆类训练轻量级二元专家模型；3) 贝叶斯平滑优化边界。

Result: 在迪拜2024年4月风暴事件中验证，FM-LEC平均F1分数提升29%，洪水边界更清晰。

Conclusion: FM-LC框架显著优于传统单阶段U-Net，为干旱地区洪水测绘提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

TL;DR: AutoSign是一种基于自回归解码器Transformer的连续手语识别方法，直接通过姿态序列生成自然语言文本，避免了传统对齐机制的问题，并在Isharah-1000数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统连续手语识别方法中多阶段流程导致的错误传播、过拟合和词汇扩展瓶颈问题。

Method: 提出AutoSign，使用1D CNN进行时间压缩，结合预训练的AraGPT2生成文本，直接映射姿态序列到自然语言。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，WER得分比现有最佳方法提高了6.1%。

Conclusion: AutoSign通过消除多阶段流程，显著提升了连续手语识别的性能，证明了手和身体姿态是最具区分性的特征。

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KR-NFT的新方法，通过负特征调优和知识正则化策略，提升视觉语言模型的OOD检测能力，同时减少对未见类和风格的泛化性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决负提示调优在OOD检测中导致模型泛化性能下降的问题。

Method: 结合负特征调优（NFT）和知识正则化（KR）策略，动态适应图像并分离正负特征空间。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，KR-NFT显著降低了FPR95，并提升了ID分类和OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: KR-NFT在提升OOD检测能力的同时，保持了模型的泛化性能，适用于未见ID数据集。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Mamba的方法在姿态提升任务中难以建模复杂的关节连接和统一的运动轨迹处理，同时忽略了运动特性的内在差异。

Method: SAMA框架包含结构感知状态集成器（SSI）和运动自适应状态调制器（MSM），分别处理关节拓扑和运动动态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAMA以较低的计算成本取得了先进的结果。

Conclusion: SAMA通过结构感知和运动自适应设计，显著提升了姿态提升任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有融合方法在场景理解或网格结构上的局限性。

Method: 采用级联流程：FLI初始化高斯位置，IMA融合语义和几何信息，MGF渲染多级BEV特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: RaGS通过动态聚焦稀疏物体，实现了高效且全面的场景感知。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

Motivation: 开放世界目标检测（OWOD）需要识别已知和未知物体，但现有方法依赖大量标注数据且易过拟合，灵活性不足。

Method: 提出OW-CLIP系统，结合多模态提示调优和Crop-Smoothing技术，利用大语言模型和跨模态相似性进行数据精炼，并提供可视化界面辅助标注。

Result: OW-CLIP仅需3.8%的自生成数据即可达到89%的SOTA性能，数据量相同时甚至优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: OW-CLIP通过高效数据利用和可视化工具，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能和标注质量。

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

Motivation: 多任务医学图像恢复（MedIR）面临不同任务间异构性导致的多样化信息损失，现有方法难以处理。

Method: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本库整合任务特定高质量先验特征，并利用潜在扩散策略迭代优化潜在特征分布。

Result: DiffCode在MRI超分辨率、CT去噪和PET合成三个任务中表现出色，定量指标和视觉质量均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffCode通过任务自适应码本和潜在扩散策略，有效解决了多任务MedIR中的异构性问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Result: 在主流基准测试中，ATCTrack实现了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ATCTrack通过动态多模态线索对齐，显著提升了复杂长期场景下的跟踪效果。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and

for real-time onboard deployment.

Conclusion: FedS2R在联邦学习下有效实现了合成到真实语义分割的泛化。

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image

without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

Motivation: 提升视觉-语言变换器在对象定位任务中的性能，尤其是在开放词汇引用对象检测（OV-RefOD）中，同时引入新的评估指标FitAP。

Method: RCA通过抑制极端值并放大中等激活来重新加权最终层注意力，使语义相关但被抑制的标记能够引导预测。

Result: 在15个开源视觉-语言模型中，RCA在11个模型中提高了FitAP性能，最高提升达26.6%。

Conclusion: RCA不仅提升了性能，还增强了多模态变换器的可解释性，适用于不同融合时机的模型。

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

Method: 提出TrackAny3D框架，结合参数高效适配器、混合几何专家架构和时序上下文优化策略。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，实现了类别无关3D SOT的最新性能。

Conclusion: TrackAny3D展示了统一模型的重要性，并推动了大规模预训练模型在该领域的应用。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

### [45] [A mini-batch training strategy for deep subspace clustering networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19917)
*Yuxuan Jiang,Chenwei Yu,Zhi Lin,Xiaolan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于mini-batch训练的深度子空间聚类方法，通过引入记忆库和对比学习，解决了传统方法依赖全批量处理的问题，并在性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度子空间聚类方法依赖全批量处理，限制了计算效率和可扩展性，尤其是在高分辨率图像上。

Method: 结合记忆库保存全局特征表示，并采用对比学习替代自编码器，实现mini-batch训练和解码器无关的框架。

Result: 在COIL100和ORL数据集上性能优于现有方法，且与全批量方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了深度子空间聚类的可扩展性和计算效率，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

Result: 实验表明，HumanSAM在二进制和多类伪造分类中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HumanSAM通过细粒度分类和增强策略，提升了伪造视频检测的可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++通过结合卷积和Mamba的优势，实现了高效且精确的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，LLM_Control在多种预训练T2I模型上优于现有方法，生成质量更高。

Conclusion: LLM_Control显著提升了复杂条件下T2I生成的控制精度和图像质量。

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

Result: 实验表明，UniCT Depth在单目深度估计任务中优于现有图像、事件及融合方法。

Conclusion: UniCT Depth通过创新模块设计，解决了事件与图像融合中的关键问题，提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP在异常检测任务中表现出高效性和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our
pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various
state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Conclusion: FROSS为实时3D语义场景图生成提供了高效解决方案，并公开了实现和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Conclusion: 新方法通过多任务预测和血管特征提取，显著提升了CVD风险评估的准确性和临床价值。

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言对比模型（如CLIP和SigLIP）依赖全局表示，限制了其在密集预测任务（如定位、OCR和分割）中的效果。

Method: 构建十亿级候选区域数据集，提出Region Transformer层提取区域语义，设计统一的区域聚类判别损失，支持对象和OCR学习。

Result: RICE在分割、密集检测和MLLM视觉感知任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been

### [59] [TAPS : Frustratingly Simple Test Time Active Learning for VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20028)
*Dhruv Sarkar,Aprameyo Chakrabartty,Bibhudatta Bhanja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的测试时主动学习（TTAL）框架，用于在实时数据流中动态查询不确定样本并更新提示，解决了单样本即时查询的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在连续数据流中仅单样本可用且需即时查询决策的实际挑战，同时满足延迟和内存限制。

Result: 在10个跨数据集迁移基准和4个领域泛化数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持合理的延迟和内存开销。

Conclusion: 为自动驾驶系统和医疗诊断等安全关键应用提供了实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

### [60] [FaRMamba: Frequency-based learning and Reconstruction aided Mamba for Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20056)
*Ze Rong,ZiYue Zhao,Zhaoxin Wang,Lei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba通过多尺度频率变换模块和自监督重建辅助编码器解决了医学图像分割中的高频信息丢失和空间结构退化问题，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割面临模糊边界、高频细节丢失和长程结构建模困难等挑战，现有方法如Vision Mamba虽能建模全局依赖，但导致局部高频信息丢失和空间结构退化。

Method: 提出FaRMamba，包含多尺度频率变换模块（MSFM）恢复高频信息，自监督重建辅助编码器（SSRAE）重建空间相关性。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上表现优于现有方法，边界精度、细节保留和全局一致性均有提升。

Conclusion: FaRMamba为医学图像分割提供了灵活的频率感知框架，直接解决了核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

### [61] [The Devil is in the EOS: Sequence Training for Detailed Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20077)
*Abdelrahman Mohamed,Yova Kementchedjhieva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS令牌的偏见，生成长度更长、细节更丰富的图像描述，无需复杂奖励函数或监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像描述生成方面取得了进展，但生成的描述往往简短且通用。研究发现，这是由于交叉熵训练中引入的对EOS令牌的偏见导致的。

Method: 提出了一种无监督方法，通过减少模型对EOS令牌的偏见，鼓励生成更长的描述。该方法简单且适用于任何预训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著增加了描述长度和相关细节，尽管幻觉率有所增加。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能显著提升图像描述的细节丰富度，适用于多种VLMs和基准测试。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

TL;DR: 提出KB-DMGen方法，结合知识库和动态掩码技术，提升人像生成的姿态精度和全局图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注姿态精度，忽视全局图像质量，需同时优化两者以实现更真实的合成效果。

Method: 设计知识库（KB）增强姿态精度并利用图像特征保持全局质量，动态掩码（DM）调整姿态区域重要性。

Result: 在HumanArt数据集上取得AP和CAP的最新最优结果。

Conclusion: KB-DMGen有效平衡姿态精度与全局质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

*Ankit Sanjyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的局部提示适应（LPA）方法，通过分解提示为内容和风格标记，选择性注入U-Net注意力层，提升布局控制和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在处理复杂提示时缺乏风格一致性和空间连贯性的问题。

Method: 将提示分解为内容和风格标记，分阶段注入U-Net注意力层，早期注入对象标记，后期注入风格标记。

Result: 在50个风格丰富的提示上评估，LPA在CLIP分数和风格一致性指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LPA为可控、表达性强的基于扩散的生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

### [64] [Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20099)
*Haoyue Li,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，HDST显著提升了去噪性能并保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理HSI及其他高维视觉数据中的复杂噪声耦合问题提供了新见解和通用框架。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于重建的框架，用于检测肘部超声图像中的内侧上髁撕脱，仅使用正常病例训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内侧上髁撕脱常见于棒球运动员，表现为骨轮廓不连续，学习正常骨结构连续性对检测异常至关重要。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器框架，学习正常骨结构的连续性，并在撕脱处产生较大重建误差。

Result: 在16名棒球运动员的数据集上，像素级AUC为0.965，图像级AUC为0.967。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有方法，数据集已公开。

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D语言模型在稀疏大规模点云上表现不佳，特征提取慢且表示精度有限。

Method: 提出NeuroVoxel-LM框架，结合NeRF与动态分辨率体素化（DR-MSV）和轻量级元嵌入（TAP-LME）技术。

Result: DR-MSV显著提升了点云特征提取的效率和精度，TAP-LME在捕捉NeRF权重中的细粒度语义上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM为3D场景感知提供了高效且精确的语言驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Local2Global是一个在线视频实例分割框架，通过局部和全局查询的早期对齐，实现高性能且时间一致的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线视频分割中时间一致性不足的问题，尤其是噪声积累、遮挡和场景转换带来的挑战。

Method: 基于DETR的查询传播框架，引入局部和全局查询，并通过L2G-aligner实现早期对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如Youtube-VIS-19/-21和OVIS，AP分别达到54.3、49.4和37.0。

Conclusion: Local2Global通过简单在线训练实现了高性能，无需复杂启发式或内存机制。

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未充分研究植物种类与病害类型关系对预测性能的影响，因此需要一种新模型来解决这一问题。

Result: 在Plant Village和PlantDoc数据集上，Mo-DsCC在准确率和F1分数上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC为智能农业提供了有效的解决方案，并为学术界和工业界带来新思路。

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

real-time instance segmentation (Box mAP@0.5 ~ 0.769, Mask mAP@0.5 ~ 0.800 at ~
15 FPS). High-fidelity masks are converted into normalized 3D coordinates, from
which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated

Result: 在DVTOD、DroneVehicle和M3FD数据集上表现优异，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: WMNet有效解决了跨模态错位问题，提升了目标检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

Method: 提出GT-mean loss，从概率角度直接建模图像均值，扩展现有损失函数，计算成本低。

Result: 实验表明，GT-mean loss能显著提升多种方法和数据集的性能。

Conclusion: GT-mean loss是一种简单有效的解决方案，可广泛应用于低光图像增强任务。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

Result: 实验表明，经高精度过滤的数据集性能优于或等同于大规模噪声数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量视觉语言训练语料提供了轻量且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\
\textbf{Availability and implementation:} Our compact VLM filtration model,
training data, utility scripts, and Supplementary data (Appendices) are freely

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态提示的身份感知体育视频描述生成方法（LLM-IAVC），通过提取球员身份信息并与视频内容结合，生成更准确的描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常忽略球员身份信息，导致描述不准确。本文旨在通过视觉识别球员身份，提升描述的准确性。

Method: 设计了身份信息提取模块（IRIEM）和视觉上下文学习模块（VCLM），结合多模态提示生成描述。

Result: 在NBA-Identity和VC-NBA-2022数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC通过视觉识别球员身份，显著提升了体育视频描述的准确性。

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出PUMPS，一种针对TPC数据的自编码器架构，解决了TPC格式在运动合成中的挑战，并在多项任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于骨骼结构的差异，运动数据难以跨骨架转移，TPC作为一种兼容性表示，缺乏直接用于运动任务学习的能力。

Method: PUMPS通过自编码器将TPC数据降维为可采样的特征向量，利用潜在高斯噪声向量作为采样标识，并引入线性分配优化重建过程。

Result: PUMPS在运动预测、过渡生成和关键帧插值等任务中表现优异，无需原生数据集监督即可达到先进水平。

Conclusion: PUMPS是一种通用的TPC数据处理架构，在多项运动任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

Motivation: 研究VLMs在空间感知（如自动驾驶和人形机器人操作）中的能力不足问题。

Method: 构建合成数据集，分为绝对空间理解和3D空间理解两类任务，测试多种先进VLMs。

Result: 人类表现接近完美，而VLMs仅在简单任务上接近人类水平，复杂任务表现显著较差。

Conclusion: VLMs在空间理解能力上有显著提升空间，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，检测mAP达70.93%（MFNet）和45.14%（DroneVehicle）。

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse有效提升融合性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

Result: 在四项低层视觉任务中，SAMwave显著优于现有方法，适用于SAM和SAM2架构。

Conclusion: SAMwave高效、灵活且可解释，为改进基础模型在复杂任务中的性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Conclusion: MambaMap在提升预测精度和时域一致性方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains

dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型忽视了范式特定的神经生理学差异，限制了泛化能力。MIRepNet针对MI范式设计，填补了这一空白。

Method: MIRepNet包含神经生理学启发的通道模板预处理流程，以及结合自监督和监督学习的混合预训练策略。

Result: 在五个公开MI数据集上，MIRepNet表现优于现有EEG模型，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MIRepNet为MI范式提供了高效、适应性强的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on
GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/staraink/MIRepNet}.

Abstract: We propose the Lightweight Multimodal Contrastive Attention Transformer
(L-MCAT), a novel transformer-based framework for label-efficient remote
sensing image classification using unpaired multimodal satellite data. L-MCAT
introduces two core innovations: (1) Modality-Spectral Adapters (MSA) that
compress high-dimensional sensor inputs into a unified embedding space, and (2)
Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous
modalities without pixel-level correspondence or labels. L-MCAT achieves 95.4%
overall accuracy on the SEN12MS dataset using only 20 labels per class,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines while using 47x fewer parameters and

spatial misalignment, demonstrating robustness for real-world deployment. The
model trains end-to-end in under 5 hours on a single consumer GPU.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为可控特征白化的框架，通过消除目标与偏置特征之间的线性相关性来提高深度神经网络的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能的广泛应用，开发可信赖的人工智能变得重要，但深度神经网络容易学习数据集中的虚假相关性。

Method: 通过量化目标与偏置特征的线性相关性（协方差矩阵），利用白化模块消除这些相关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了偏置，且无需建模高阶依赖关系，同时在四个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整权重系数平衡算法效用与公平性，且无需正则化或对抗学习，优化更稳定。

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TVT的策略，通过将8倍下采样的VAE转换为4倍下采样的VAE，并结合预训练的UNet，显著提升了图像超分辨率中精细结构的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于稳定扩散（SD）模型的真实图像超分辨率方法在重建图像精细结构（如小字符和纹理）时表现不佳，主要原因是SD模型中VAE的激进分辨率降低（如8倍下采样）。

Method: 提出TVT策略，首先基于原始VAE编码器的输出特征训练一个4倍下采样的解码器，然后固定新训练的解码器并训练一个4倍下采样的编码器。同时优化网络架构以减少计算成本。

Result: 实验结果表明，TVT方法显著改善了精细结构的保留效果，同时计算成本低于现有的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: TVT策略成功解决了SD模型中VAE下采样率过高的问题，同时提升了图像超分辨率的性能，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT是一个快速跨传感器适应框架，通过无监督采样和敏感权重更新，显著减少适应时间并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在跨传感器数据上性能下降的问题，避免昂贵的全量重新训练。

Method: 使用无监督采样选择3%信息量最大的样本，通过梯度分析识别并更新敏感权重。

Result: 适应时间从几小时缩短至约一分钟，性能优于直接迁移基准，甚至媲美全量重新训练。

Conclusion: SWIFT为跨传感器图像融合提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D渲染和2D扩散模型的混合方法，用于在动态视频中插入3D对象，解决时间一致性和光照真实性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态场景中插入3D对象时，传统方法难以同时实现时间一致性和光照真实性。2D扩散模型缺乏时间一致性，而3D渲染方法则无法达到真实光照效果。

Method: 结合3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）和2D扩散模型，先通过3DGS实现时间一致性，再用扩散模型优化光照。提出了一种基于着色的流程，分离对象属性并优化图像。

Result: 该方法在动态手腕场景中成功插入手镯，实现了时间一致性和光照真实性的平衡。

Conclusion: 首次将3D渲染与2D扩散模型结合，为视频对象插入提供了高效且真实的解决方案。

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Conclusion: PIVOTS为肝脏配准提供了高效解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集以促进公平比较。

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

Result: VIM-Sense在AR-VIM数据集上达到88.94%的检测准确率，优于仅视觉或文本的基线方法，检测延迟约7秒。

Conclusion: VIM-Sense能有效检测AR中的视觉信息操纵攻击，为AR安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

Motivation: 现有方法基于通用预训练模型（如ImageNet），难以学习与高级美学评估真正对齐的特征表示。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）在FFHQ数据集上通过自监督去噪任务预训练Diffusion Transformer；2）冻结编码器，仅微调轻量回归头。

Result: 在FBP5500基准测试中达到PCC 0.932，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式预训练策略是关键，能学习更具语义特征的表征，适用于主观视觉任务。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光图像增强任务因噪声、细节丢失和对比度差而具有挑战性，现有方法仅依赖RGB图像的像素级变换，忽略了多模态上下文信息。

Method: 提出ModalFormer框架，包含跨模态Transformer（CM-T）和多个辅助子网络，利用新型跨模态多头自注意力机制（CM-MSA）融合RGB数据与多模态特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ModalFormer通过充分利用多模态信息，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

Conclusion: 论文验证了五种模型在印度驾驶数据集上的有效性，为自动驾驶场景理解提供了参考。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification
methodologies for enhancing communication in deaf & mute communities.

Conclusion: 深度学习和基础模型在预测工作适应性方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Conclusion: 联合学习3D重建和头部合成的方法优于传统方法，优化了面部表情表示和唇同步效果。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose
of audio-based lip-sync. To this end, we propose a novel lip-sync pipeline
that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

TL;DR: SparseVAR是一个用于加速视觉自回归模型的框架，通过动态排除低频率token减少计算开销，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率阶段的计算开销大，低频率token对图像质量影响小且与邻近token相似。

Method: 使用轻量级MSE指标识别低频率token，并通过锚点token保持区域保真度。

Result: 在Infinity-2B中实现2倍加速，图像质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: SparseVAR有效减少计算成本，提升模型效率。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少误诊并在多类场景中优先处理重要症状，验证了其组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法通过层次结构优化MIL预测，显著提升临床诊断的准确性和优先级处理能力。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

Result: 在复杂场景中配准误差降低41.9%，融合后PSNR提升10.11 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了场景对齐和重建保真度，适用于机器人感知和自主导航。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

Conclusion: 改进的YOLOv8s-p2模型兼具高精度和速度，为杂交水稻制种的自动化监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Result: 小感受野适合高分辨率数据，中等感受野对发展阶段分割更优，SAR与AMSR2融合提升性能。

Conclusion: 选择适合观测分辨率和目标特性的空间上下文对优化海冰分割模型至关重要。

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Result: 在11个数据集上表现优异，验证了主导属性探索对分类性能的提升。

Conclusion: BCT-CLIP通过主导属性和对比学习，显著提升了小样本学习的分类效果。

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease

vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the
types of errors made by VLMs and suggest potential pathways for future VLM
development. Our dataset and code are available at

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic

computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage
YOLOv8 pipeline enables accurate, real-time, multi-class categorisation of
lentils, implemented on a low-cost, modular hardware platform. The pneumatic
ejection mechanism separates defective grains, while an Arduino-based control
system coordinates real-time interaction between the vision system and
mechanical components. The system operates effectively at a conveyor speed of
59 mm/s, achieving a grain separation accuracy of 87.2%. Despite a limited

of machine vision for grain sorting and provides a modular foundation for
future enhancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型对提示词敏感，用户需反复调整且缺乏明确反馈，现有方法可控性有限或需额外训练。

Method: T2I-Copilot由三个代理组成：输入解析器、生成引擎和质量评估器，分别负责解析输入、选择模型并生成、评估生成质量。

Result: 在开源模型上，T2I-Copilot的VQA分数接近商业模型，成本仅为FLUX1.1-pro的16.59%且性能提升6.17%。

Conclusion: T2I-Copilot通过多代理协作实现了高效、低成本的文本到图像生成优化，支持全自动和人工干预模式。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly

*Jingting Li,Yu Qian,Lin Zhao,Su-Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合心理学先验和统计模式的FED-PsyAU框架，通过分层学习和联邦学习解决微表情识别中的样本不足和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别因样本少、特征细微及隐私问题而面临挑战，需一种高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 结合心理学研究的面部动作单元协调知识，开发DPK-GAT网络进行分层特征学习，并采用联邦学习框架避免数据共享。

Result: 在常用微表情数据库上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FED-PsyAU框架显著提升了微表情识别性能，同时解决了隐私和样本限制问题。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker提出了一种仅需音频输入即可生成逼真3D面部动画的方法，无需额外先验信息，提升了实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要额外先验信息（如类别标签或3D面部网格），限制了实用性和个性化表现。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1.记忆通用动作；2.通过音频驱动的说话风格特征进行个性化面部动画合成。

Result: 定量、定性评估及用户研究表明，MemoryTalker在个性化面部动画上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MemoryTalker无需额外先验信息即可生成可靠的个性化面部动画，实用性高。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过逐帧对齐真实数据最小化重建损失，但忽略了面部运动的连续性，导致输出不自然。

Method: 提出了一种新的语音上下文感知损失，通过引入音素协同发音权重，动态调整面部运动的重要性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于传统重建损失方法。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在语音驱动的3D面部动画中显式建模语音上下文依赖音素的重要性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Motivation: 传统船舶检测方法依赖单模态图像（如可见光或红外），在复杂场景（如多变光照和浓雾）中表现受限。

Method: 提出LSFDNet算法，结合图像融合与目标检测任务的特征交互，引入MLCF模块和OE损失函数，并建立NSLSR数据集。

Result: 在两个数据集上验证了算法的优越性，检测性能显著提升。

Conclusion: LSFDNet通过多模态融合和任务交互，有效解决了复杂场景下的船舶检测问题。

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI肿瘤分割在3D数据处理中面临计算复杂性和连续性不足的问题，现有模型未充分利用相邻切片的空间相关性。

Method: M-Net引入Mesh-Cast机制整合序列模型，设计TPS训练策略，分阶段学习序列通用模式和切片特定特征。

Result: 在BraTS2019和BraTS2023数据集上，M-Net在所有关键指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-Net通过时空建模技术，成为MRI肿瘤分割中高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

Conclusion: HYPIR在高效高质量图像修复方面优于现有方法，实现了快速收敛和推理。

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

Motivation: 视频异常检测面临多尺度时间依赖性、视觉-语义异质性和标记数据稀缺等挑战，需要一种高效的方法进行时空定位。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence基准测试中，DAMS表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAMS通过双路径互补和信息融合，构建了全面的异常事件表示与识别能力，为视频异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

Motivation: 现有基于注意力的令牌修剪方法存在位置偏差等局限性，需要一种更有效的方法来识别重要令牌。

Result: 实验表明，TransPrune在保持多模态性能的同时，将推理计算量减少一半以上，TTV单独使用也表现优异。

Conclusion: TransPrune为LVLM提供了一种高效且无需训练的令牌修剪方案，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

Conclusion: 该方法在无图例和离散调色板的可视化中均表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Result: 成功估计相机的滚转和俯仰角，适用于多相机系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为受限环境中的相机姿态估计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

Result: 该方法对振动源具有不变性，能正确估计液体水平，且能泛化到未见过的容器实例和液体水平。

Conclusion: 该方法为远程、非接触式检测密封容器内液体水平提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Method: 使用Flux.1-dev和Stable Diffusion v3.5生成平衡数据集FairFaceGen，结合多种身份增强方法，并在标准及挑战性基准上评估。

Result: 合成数据在IJB-B/C上泛化能力仍落后于真实数据，但SD35生成的平衡数据集显示出减少偏见的潜力。

Conclusion: 合成数据可用于构建更公平的FR系统，但需注意增强的数量和质量对准确性和公平性的影响。

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

Motivation: 现有AVS方法主要关注交互效率，而忽视了模态表示差异和失衡问题，导致在复杂场景中可能出现错误匹配。

Method: 提出ICF框架和MIT方法，通过多粒度文本建立模态共享空间，并引入语义反事实（SC）和协作分布感知对比学习（CDCL）来减少偏差并实现跨模态对齐。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过隐式反事实和多粒度文本有效解决了模态差异问题，提升了AVS任务的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病诊断需要同时满足高精度、跨数据集泛化、对缺失模态的鲁棒性和可解释性，现有方法无法同时满足这些需求。

Method: OmniBrain整合脑MRI、放射组学、基因表达和临床数据，采用交叉注意力和模态丢弃的统一模型。

Conclusion: OmniBrain为阿尔茨海默病诊断提供了鲁棒、可解释且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Method: 提出KASportsFormer框架，包含BoneExt和LimbFus模块，提取并融合运动信息。

Result: 在SportsPose和WorldPose数据集上分别达到58.0mm和34.3mm的MPJPE误差。

Conclusion: KASportsFormer在运动场景中表现优异，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Motivation: 解决计算病理学中模型在不同扫描仪下性能不一致的问题，这对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 引入SCORPION数据集（480个组织样本，每个用5台扫描仪扫描）和SimCons框架（结合增强技术和一致性损失）。

Result: SimCons提高了模型在不同扫描仪下的一致性，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: SCORPION和SimCons为研究社区提供了评估和改进模型一致性的重要资源。

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD作为一种外部插件，保留了CLIP的原始能力，同时显著提升了人脸伪造检测的性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available
at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent为遥感多模态数据提供了一种统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Method: 创建FantasyID数据集，模拟真实ID卡设计，包含多样化的设计风格、语言和真实人脸，并模拟数字伪造攻击。

Result: 现有先进检测算法在FantasyID数据集上表现不佳，尤其在接近实际应用的条件下，假阴性率接近50%。

Conclusion: FantasyID数据集复杂度高，适合作为检测算法的评估基准。

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Split Coordinate Attention (SCA)的新型注意力模块，通过双空间范围池化核捕获远程空间交互，显著提升了建筑足迹提取的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑足迹提取在遥感图像分析中具有重要意义，但现有方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出SCA模块，通过双空间范围池化核和分通道编码技术，优化语义特征提取。

Result: SCANet在WHU和Massachusetts数据集上表现优异，IoU分别达到91.61%和75.49%。

Conclusion: SCA模块有效提升了建筑足迹提取的精度，为相关应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional
and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter
significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散视频生成方法在生成全身运动和自然语音时缺乏多模态一致性，且缺乏全面的评估框架和区域性能分析基准。

Method: 提出了JWB-DH-V1数据集（包含10,000个独特身份的200万视频样本）和评估协议，用于评估音频-视频联合生成。

Result: 评估显示现有模型在面部/手部与全身性能之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 数据集和工具公开可用，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

TL;DR: 论文指出现有CLIP少样本分类方法的评估存在问题，提出了一种基于遗忘技术的真实归纳基准，并改进了分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP少样本分类方法的评估模式未能真实反映其归纳泛化能力，因为多数数据集已被CLIP模型见过。

Method: 提出了一种使用遗忘技术的管道，以获取真实的归纳基准，并改进了少样本分类方法。

Result: 在新归纳设置下，现有方法性能显著下降（平均下降55%），改进方法在5880次实验中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了CLIP少样本分类评估的问题，提出了基于遗忘的解决方案、新基准和改进方法。

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

TL;DR: METEOR提出了一种多阶段剪枝框架，用于高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，显著减少冗余视觉标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单编码器架构在多模态任务中的泛化限制，以及多编码器融合方法的高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用渐进式剪枝策略，包括编码阶段的协作标记分配、融合阶段的跨编码器剪枝和解码阶段的自适应剪枝。

Result: 在11个基准测试中验证有效性，相比EAGLE减少76%视觉标记，性能仅下降0.3%。

Conclusion: METEOR首次成功实现了高效的多编码器视觉语言模型，为多模态任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code
is available at https://github.com/YuchenLiu98/METEOR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“安全张量”的方法，通过可训练的输入向量将文本安全对齐扩展到视觉模态，以解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉输入中的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本安全机制无法直接应用于视觉模态，导致LVLM容易受到有害图像输入的影响。

Method: 引入安全张量（可训练的输入向量），通过文本或视觉模态在推理时应用，优化使用包含恶意和良性样本的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，安全张量显著提升了LVLM拒绝有害视觉输入的能力，同时保持对良性任务的性能。

Conclusion: 安全张量成功将文本安全机制扩展到视觉模态，激活语言模块的“安全层”，有效提升模型安全性。

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

TL;DR: $S^3$LAM是一种新型RGB-D SLAM系统，通过2D surfel splatting实现高精度几何表示，优于现有3DGS方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS-based SLAM方法依赖3D高斯椭球，效率较低，$S^3$LAM旨在通过2D高斯surfel提升场景表示效率和精度。

Method: 采用2D高斯surfel作为基本单元，结合自适应表面渲染策略和相机位姿Jacobian优化，实现高效跟踪与建图。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，$S^3$LAM达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM通过2D surfel splatting显著提升SLAM的几何表示和跟踪精度，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么缺乏生成能力，要么忽略对象级结构，无法满足高质量视频合成的需求。

Method: 学习姿态不变的对象中心槽，并将其与预训练的扩散模型结合，实现时序一致的视频生成和编辑。

Result: 在视频生成质量和时序一致性上优于现有方法，支持对象插入、删除和替换等编辑操作。

Conclusion: 该方法在交互式视频生成和动态场景理解方面具有潜力，显著提升了生成和编辑能力。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出UnionCut和UnionSeg方法，解决无监督对象发现中的前景背景区分和对象数量不确定问题，提升了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督对象发现（UOD）缺乏标注数据，现有方法依赖启发式前景先验和固定迭代次数，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出基于min-cut和集成方法的UnionCut前景先验，以及高效准确的UnionSeg蒸馏模型。

Conclusion: UnionCut和UnionSeg为UOD提供了更鲁棒的前景先验和动态停止机制，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1为更安全、智能的自动驾驶系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

Motivation: 非手动面部特征在手语交流中至关重要，但在ASLR中的研究不足，现有方法多依赖手工特征提取且未深入比较不同面部区域的作用。

Method: 使用两种深度学习模型（CNN和Transformer）在孤立手语数据集上系统评估眼睛、嘴部和全脸区域的贡献。

Result: 通过定量和定性分析，发现嘴部是最重要的非手动面部特征，显著提升识别准确率。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在ASLR中纳入面部特征的必要性。

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在Img2LaTeX任务中表现不佳，尤其是在细粒度视觉元素处理上。

Method: 提出$A^2R^2$框架，结合注意力定位和迭代优化，使VLMs能够自我修正并逐步提升预测质量。

Result: 实验表明$A^2R^2$在六个评估指标上显著优于基线方法，且推理轮次增加带来性能提升。

Conclusion: $A^2R^2$通过视觉推理和迭代优化有效提升了Img2LaTeX任务的性能，验证了其核心组件的协同作用。

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

Motivation: 传统图像去雪方法存在幻觉伪影问题，视频方法对帧率要求高且对齐困难。事件相机因其低延迟特性，适合解决这一问题。

Result: 在PSNR上优于现有方法3 dB，且能提升深度估计和光流任务性能20%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视觉系统在恶劣天气下的可靠性，为全天候应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Motivation: 低空无人机场景中的RIS研究不足，现有方法难以处理其独特特性（如多样视角和高密度对象）。

Method: 提出了SAARN网络，通过类别主导的语言增强（CDLE）和自适应推理融合模块（ARFM）动态处理语义信息。

Result: 实验表明RIS-LAD对现有RIS算法构成挑战，SAARN能有效解决这些挑战。

Conclusion: RIS-LAD填补了LAD场景RIS研究的空白，SAARN为复杂场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 康复运动评估缺乏标准化基准和可重复方法，限制了研究进展和可比性。

Method: 整合现有数据集为Rehab-Pile，提出基准框架，并对多种深度学习架构进行评估。

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all
publicly available.

### [162] [Exploring text-to-image generation for historical document image retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20934)
*Melissa Cote,Alexandra Branzan Albu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合生成式AI（T2I）的方法T2I-QBE，用于解决传统QBE搜索需要样本查询文档的问题，通过文本提示生成查询图像，并在历史文档数据集上验证了其可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统QBE搜索需要用户提供样本查询文档，这在某些情况下不可行。ABDIR虽然提供了基于视觉属性的检索方式，但仍存在局限性。论文旨在通过生成式AI（T2I）弥补QBE和ABDIR之间的差距。

Method: 提出T2I-QBE方法，利用Leonardo.Ai生成基于文本提示的查询图像，结合传统QBE范式进行文档图像检索。

Result: 在HisIR19历史文档数据集上的实验验证了T2I-QBE的可行性，表明其可以作为一种有效的文档图像检索方法。

Conclusion: T2I-QBE是首次尝试将T2I生成技术应用于文档图像检索，为历史文档等独特视觉特征的文档检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video是一个多模态模型，用于端到端处理视频中的视觉、音频和文本信号，支持多粒度视频理解和推理，显著提升了用户参与度和满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型缺乏对短视频的深入理解能力，而短视频在移动互联网中占据主导地位，需要更高效的视频搜索、推荐和应用支持。

Method: 模型通过预训练、指令微调、冷启动、强化学习后训练和最终指令微调的综合训练方案，利用高质量自动化标注数据进行训练。

Result: 在ShortVid-Bench基准测试中表现优异，支持零样本或少样本微调，推理时间短（10秒处理1分钟视频）。

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video在真实世界视频理解任务中表现出色，实际部署中显著提升了用户体验和效率。

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需掩码的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法，解决了现有掩码策略导致的信息丢失和身份细节退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码的方法存在信息丢失、身份参考图像与输入图像差异导致性能下降，以及身份参考可能引入无关元素的问题。

Method: 采用两步地标方法将输入图像转换为闭口状态，随后通过唇部适配模型生成与音频同步的唇部动作，无需掩码或身份参考图像。

Result: 在LRS2和HDTF数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，并通过消融研究支持了其贡献。

Conclusion: 提出的无掩码方法在保持身份细节和视觉质量方面优于现有掩码策略。

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局时间聚合去噪网络（GTAD），通过聚合局部和全局时间特征，提升动态环境感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用全局时间序列信息，导致动态环境感知不足。

Method: 采用全局时间信息聚合框架，结合局部和全局时间特征，通过去噪网络实现高效3D场景理解。

Result: 在nuScenes和Occ3D-nuScenes基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: GTAD方法显著提升了动态环境的全局时间信息利用能力，实现了更连贯和全面的环境理解。

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LargeMvC-Net的新型深度网络架构，用于解决大规模多视图聚类问题，通过分解优化过程为三个模块，显著提升了效果和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于锚点的多视图聚类方法在锚点结构设计上缺乏优化原则，忽略了核心结构需求，导致性能受限。

Method: 将锚点聚类过程分解为RepresentModule、NoiseModule和AnchorModule三个模块，分别对应表示学习、噪声抑制和锚点指示器估计，并通过无监督重建损失对齐视图。

Result: 在多个大规模多视图基准测试中，LargeMvC-Net在效果和可扩展性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net通过明确的结构设计和优化可追溯性，为大规模多视图聚类提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

Motivation: CNN在计算机视觉中表现优异，但对对抗攻击敏感，现有对抗训练方法在模型准确性和鲁棒性之间存在差距。

Method: 训练多个对抗训练的教师模型，通过多教师知识蒸馏指导学生模型在干净数据上学习，并设计自适应学习策略动态分配权重。

Result: 在MNIST-Digits和Fashion-MNIST数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了CNN对抗不同攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多教师对抗蒸馏和自适应学习策略能有效增强CNN的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗数据即可实现。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统面部情绪识别方法使用固定的情绪类别或维度值，限制了泛化能力和应用范围。自然语言描述能更灵活、丰富地表达情绪，但缺乏大规模数据集和有效框架。

Method: 提出EmoCap100K数据集（10万样本）和EmoCapCLIP框架，采用全局-局部对比学习并结合跨模态引导的正样本挖掘模块。

Result: 在20多个基准测试中表现优异，验证了从大规模语义丰富描述中学习情绪表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用自然语言描述作为监督信号可以显著提升面部情绪识别的性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型（如GPT-4o）的专有性质及其训练数据对开源研究的限制。

Method: 利用GPT-4o统一和优化三个流行图像编辑数据集，通过重新生成图像和改写提示来提升数据质量。

Result: 微调后的开源模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著缩小了与专有模型的差距。

Conclusion: GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M的发布有望推动指令引导图像编辑的开源研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

Motivation: 4D空间智能重建是计算机视觉中的核心挑战，现有综述未能全面分析其层次结构，因此需要新的视角来组织现有方法。

Method: 将方法分为五个层次：低层3D属性重建、3D场景组件重建、4D动态场景重建、交互建模及物理约束整合。

Result: 提出了一个层次化的分类框架，并总结了每层的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该研究为4D空间智能重建提供了系统化的视角，并指出了未来发展的方向。

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date
project page: https://github.com/yukangcao/Awesome-4D-Spatial-Intelligence.

Motivation: 传统固定竞价和匹配机制在动态频谱共享中效率低下，限制了参与者策略调整能力。

Method: 引入组合竞价机制和频谱等效映射系数，采用贪心匹配算法动态分配频谱。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方案显著优于现有方法，社会福利更高。

Conclusion: 灵活竞价机制在动态频谱共享中更高效。

Abstract: Traditional combinatorial spectrum auctions mainly rely on fixed bidding and
matching processes, which limit participants' ability to adapt their strategies
and often result in suboptimal social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing
environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approximately
truthful combinatorial forward auction scheme with a flexible bidding mechanism
aimed at enhancing resource efficiency and maximizing social welfare. In the
proposed scheme, each buyer submits a combinatorial bid consisting of the base
spectrum demand and adjustable demand ranges, enabling the auctioneer to
dynamically optimize spectrum allocation in response to market conditions. To
standardize the valuation across heterogeneous frequency bands, we introduce a
Spectrum Equivalent Mapping (SEM) coefficient. A greedy matching algorithm is
employed to determine winning bids by sorting buyers based on their equivalent
unit bid prices and allocating resources within supply constraints. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed flexible bidding mechanism significantly
outperforms existing benchmark methods, achieving notably higher social welfare
in dynamic spectrum sharing scenarios.

Motivation: 研究如何在组合问题（如预算最大化）中设计合约以激励代理，同时避免传统方法对需求预言机的假设。

Method: 提出“局部-全局”框架，通过局部步骤解决需求问题的变体，全局步骤找到近似最优合约。

Result: 成功将FPTAS应用于合约设计问题，并在多维预算、预算拟阵和预算匹配等约束下实现近似最优解。

Conclusion: 该框架为组合合约设计提供了通用解决方案，并扩展到多代理场景。

Abstract: Consider costly tasks that add up to the success of a project, and must be
fitted by an agent into a given time-frame. This is an instance of the classic
budgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS).
Now assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is
the one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design
a contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In
this work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which
transforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)
to tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach
diverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an
assumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.
  We first show how to "lift" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the
best-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design
problem. We establish this through our "local-global" framework, in which the
"local" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of
the demand problem. The "global" step then utilizes the local one to find the
approximately optimal contract. We apply our framework to a host of
combinatorial constraints including multi-dimensional budgets, budgeted
matroid, and budgeted matching constraints. In all cases we achieve an
approximation essentially matching the best approximation for the purely
algorithmic problem. We also develop a method to tackle multi-agent contract
settings, where the team of working agents must abide to combinatorial
feasibility constraints.

Recently, variants of envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1, EFX) were
introduced for this setting, based on flips or exchanges of items. Namely, one
can define envy-freeness up to one/any flip (EFF1, EFFX), meaning that an agent
$i$ does not envy another agent $j$ after performing one or any one-item flip
between their bundles that improves the value of $i$.
  We explore algorithmic aspects of this notion, and our contribution is
twofold: we present both algorithmic and impossibility results, highlighting a
stark contrast between the classic EFX concept and its flip-based analogue.
First, we explore standard techniques used in the literature and show that they
fail to guarantee EFFX approximations. On the positive side, we show that we
can achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee when agents share a
common ranking over item values, based on the well-known envy cycle elimination
technique. This idea also leads to a generalized algorithm with approximation
guarantees when agents agree on the top $n$ items and their valuation functions
are bounded. Finally, we show that an algorithm that maximizes the Nash welfare
guarantees a 1/2-EFF1 allocation, and that this bound is tight.

Conclusion: 结论指出，需结合行为模型与可视化设计，以更准确地推断投标者偏好，避免实践中次优分配。

Abstract: Visualization dashboards are increasingly used in strategic settings like
auctions to enhance decision-making and reduce strategic confusion. This paper
presents behavioral experiments evaluating how different dashboard designs
affect bid optimization in reverse first-price auctions. Additionally, we
assess how dashboard designs impact the auction designer's ability to
accurately infer bidders' preferences within the dashboard mechanism framework.
We compare visualizations of the bid allocation rule, commonly deployed in
practice, to alternatives that display expected utility. We find that
utility-based visualizations significantly improve bidding by reducing
cognitive demands on bidders. However, even with improved dashboards, bidders
systematically under-shade their bids, driven by an implicit preference for
certain wins in uncertain settings. As a result, dashboard-based mechanisms
that assume fully rational or risk-neutral bidder responses to dashboards can
produce significant estimation errors when inferring private preferences, which
may lead to suboptimal allocations in practice. Explicitly modeling agents'
behavioral responses to dashboards substantially improves inference accuracy,
highlighting the need to align visualization design and econometric inference
assumptions in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的方法，利用GPS轨迹数据生成完整的行为活动模式，填补了传统交通调查中轮班工人数据的缺失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮班工人占工业化社会劳动力的15-20%，但在传统交通调查中代表性不足，导致对其出行需求的理解存在偏差。

Method: 采用基于Transformer的模型，结合周期性时间嵌入和过渡损失函数，从碎片化GPS数据生成完整活动模式。

Result: 生成的数据与洛杉矶县的GPS数据分布高度一致（平均JSD < 0.02）。

Conclusion: 该方法为交通规划者提供了强大的数据增强工具，支持更精确和包容的城市交通规划。

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

Result: 实验显示MAE降低23%，泛化能力提升30%，优于ConvLSTM基线。

Conclusion: 该网络适用于大规模部署，具有高效和泛化优势。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

Motivation: 传统神经网络存在计算复杂性和过参数化问题，需要更高效、可解释的替代方案。

Method: 在小波域中应用可学习的非线性变换（如软阈值和增益相位调制），并包含可微分的小波基选择机制。

Result: 在3D去噪和GLUE基准测试中，模型性能接近Transformer基线，但参数和内存消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: 谱学习框架为视觉和语言任务提供了紧凑、高效且可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的UGC容易受到煽动和操纵，需要有效监管。自动化内容审核虽能过滤违规内容，但用户会采取策略性应对，因此需平衡言论自由与社会扭曲。

Method: 通过机制设计优化言论自由与社会扭曲的权衡，提出近似最优解的实用方法，并分析离线数据需求。

Result: 尽管最优权衡是NP难问题，但提出了近似最优解的方法，并提供了数据需求的泛化保证。

Conclusion: 研究为社交媒体内容审核提供了理论框架，平衡了言论自由与社会扭曲，并提出了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

Conclusion: MAC可作为特征选择的有效指标，提升SHM系统在不同结构间的泛化能力。

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

Result: PINN能够有效解决正向和逆向问题，并在稀疏数据下表现出色。

Conclusion: PINN通过结合先验知识，为复杂微分方程的求解和参数优化提供了高效且通用的方法。

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext
customer-support dataset and proprietary telecom datasets demonstrate high
prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons
(MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research
advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset
\textit{AbnormalHeartbeat} that contains audio signals obtained from the
stethoscope.

TL;DR: 论文提出了PUCS框架，用于解决信息获取与顺序决策问题，包括离线贪婪探测算法和在线OLPA算法，实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源与回报未知且探测成本高的场景（如拼车、无线调度等）中的顺序决策问题。

Method: 离线：贪婪探测算法；在线：OLPA算法（随机组合多臂老虎机）。

Result: 离线：常数因子近似保证；在线：遗憾上界$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$，下界$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$。

Conclusion: PUCS框架及算法在实际应用中表现高效，理论分析验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents promising
opportunities for automation and enhancement in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA). However, comprehensively evaluating these models in circuit design
remains challenging due to the narrow scope of existing benchmarks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMCircuitEval, the first multimodal benchmark
specifically designed to assess MLLM performance comprehensively across diverse
EDA tasks. MMCircuitEval comprises 3614 meticulously curated question-answer
(QA) pairs spanning digital and analog circuits across critical EDA stages -
ranging from general knowledge and specifications to front-end and back-end
design. Derived from textbooks, technical question banks, datasheets, and
real-world documentation, each QA pair undergoes rigorous expert review for
accuracy and relevance. Our benchmark uniquely categorizes questions by design
stage, circuit type, tested abilities (knowledge, comprehension, reasoning,
computation), and difficulty level, enabling detailed analysis of model
capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant
performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and
complex computations, highlighting the critical need for targeted training
datasets and modeling approaches. MMCircuitEval provides a foundational
resource for advancing MLLMs in EDA, facilitating their integration into
real-world circuit design workflows. Our benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将图结构信息嵌入到LLM兼容格式时面临计算成本高或丢失关键细节的问题，且依赖源域标注数据，限制了适应性。

Conclusion: STAG为图学习与LLM的结合提供了优雅解决方案，支持零样本迁移学习。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

TL;DR: LANTERN是一种模块化架构，通过融合自适应调查响应和上下文信号来建模用户行为，优于仅依赖调查的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查在用户行为建模中存在局限性（如用户疲劳和不完整响应），需要结合其他信号以提升效果。

Method: LANTERN采用选择性门控、残差连接和跨注意力机制，以调查数据为主信号，仅在相关时引入外部模态。

Result: LANTERN在多标签预测中优于仅依赖调查的基线方法，并通过消融实验验证了选择性模态依赖的优势。

Conclusion: LANTERN为以调查为中心的行为建模提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球绿色氢投资增加，但缺乏大规模设施的历史维护数据，特别是在沙漠环境中，导致风险评估困难。

Method: 开发人工智能决策支持系统，利用公开气象数据生成维护压力指数（MPI），预测基础设施的维护需求和风险水平。

Result: MPI可作为评估绿色氢基础设施维护压力的可靠工具，支持监管和运营决策。

Conclusion: 该工具填补了历史数据缺失的空白，为绿色氢项目的拍卖和规划提供了风险智能支持。

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

Result: 内部验证表现良好（SBP: R²=0.86, RMSE=6.03 mmHg; DBP: R²=0.49, RMSE=7.13 mmHg），外部验证显示性能下降30%。不确定性量化生成了有效的预测区间。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨机构AI辅助血压监测提供了实际部署的期望，并公开了源代码。

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

Motivation: 传统提示调优方法固定提示缺乏灵活性，联邦学习中存在通信和计算限制问题，需一种兼顾灵活性和隐私保护的方法。

Method: 引入动态提示生成网络（FedDPG），根据输入生成上下文感知提示，同时冻结预训练语言模型参数。

Result: 在三个NLP基准数据集上，FedDPG在全局模型性能上优于现有方法，显著减少计算时间和通信参数。

Conclusion: FedDPG是一种高效、灵活且隐私保护的动态提示生成方法，适用于联邦学习场景。

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 将SwiftTD算法的优势扩展到控制问题，解决在噪声信号中识别关键信号的挑战。

Method: 结合SwiftTD和True Online Sarsa(λ)的思想，开发了Swift-Sarsa算法，并在一个包含噪声信号的基准测试中验证其性能。

Result: Swift-Sarsa能够在无先验知识的情况下识别关键信号，并有效处理噪声。

Conclusion: Swift-Sarsa为解决大规模特征搜索问题提供了新思路，且性能不受噪声影响。

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的模型隐私，防止窃听者获取敏感信息。

Method: 将模型学习视为参数估计问题，通过偏移量驱动Fisher信息矩阵至奇异，同时安全共享偏移量以保持模型准确性。

Result: 方案在保持模型精度的同时，实现了更高的模型偏移，且需要更少的带宽秘密通道。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保护隐私并通过收敛测试，优于噪声注入方案。

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

Conclusion: 该方法可实时运行并集成到临床电解剖标测系统中，展示了无监督学习在揭示心内信号生理特征方面的潜力。

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Conclusion: Graded Transformer为结构化深度学习提供了数学基础，推动了可解释、高效系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven
models and paving the way for interpretable, efficient systems in complex
domains.

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法中需要访问本地数据和重复解决质量传输问题的高复杂度问题。

Method: 使用高度聚合信息，避免矩阵向量操作，降低每次迭代的复杂度。

Result: 算法具有低复杂度和高可扩展性，在混合模型示例中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该算法在计算效率和可扩展性方面表现出色，适用于大规模分布问题。

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it
to the state-of-the-art methods on several examples of mixture models.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票市场高度波动，传统方法难以生成稳定利润，因此需要新的损失函数来优化交易策略。

Method: 提出四种损失函数，结合时间序列模型（如Crossformer）训练，以优化股票交易策略。

Result: 在2021-2023年测试中，最佳损失函数驱动的Crossformer模型分别实现51.42%、51.04%和48.62%的回报，优于PPO和DDPG等强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 新损失函数结合时间序列模型能有效提升股票交易策略的盈利能力，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

TL;DR: 神经网络在特征学习能力上优于核方法，但现有理论主要关注特征学习的强度而非质量，不足以解释泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络为何在某些任务（如阶梯函数）上显著优于核方法，并探讨现有特征学习理论的局限性。

Method: 引入“特征质量”概念，评估现有特征学习理论，并通过实验验证其局限性。

Result: 现有理论主要衡量特征学习的强度，而非特征质量，无法充分解释神经网络的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要开发新的理论框架，以更好地理解特征质量对神经网络泛化的影响。

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

Motivation: 研究人类与AI在舞蹈中的耦合互动，超越文本和语音的交流方式。

Method: 收集18名舞者3小时的舞蹈数据，提供精细的萨尔萨舞动作标注，并开发多任务SalsaAgent模型。

Result: 数据集包含2800多个动作片段，涵盖不同技能水平，模型能完成生成领舞或跟舞者动作等任务。

Conclusion: CoMPAS3D为社交互动AI和创意人形动作生成研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

Motivation: CAN协议缺乏安全机制，易受网络攻击，需高效检测方法。

Method: 将CAN流量表示为图，使用多层GAT作为教师模型，通过知识蒸馏训练小型学生模型。

Result: 学生模型在Car-Hacking和Car-Survival数据集上分别达到99.97%和99.31%的准确率，但在can-train-and-test上因类别不平衡表现较差。

Conclusion: KD-GAT有效提升检测性能，未来需解决类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人们在访问某个商业场所后的去向对城市规划、零售分析和基于位置的服务至关重要，但传统方法因数据稀疏性和空间与商业关系的复杂性而难以准确预测。

Method: 提出NAICS-aware GraphSAGE，通过可学习的嵌入整合商业分类知识，结合空间、时间和社会经济特征，实现端到端的预测。

Result: 在包含9490万共访记录的POI-Graph数据集上，R-squared值从0.243提升至0.625（提升157%），排名质量也有显著提升（NDCG@10提升32%）。

Conclusion: 商业语义信息（如行业代码）对预测共访模式至关重要，新方法在性能和可扩展性上均优于现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Result: 通过案例研究验证了框架的有效性，隐私性显著提升且效用损失小，同时支持混合模型合成。

Conclusion: 分离生成模型框架在隐私保护和数据效用方面表现优异，适用于多种模型类型。

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近似最近邻（ANN）搜索在向量数据库中常导致语义冗余，无法满足检索增强生成（RAG）等应用对多样性和上下文丰富性的需求。

Method: 提出基于语义图的向量检索方法，通过在向量空间上叠加语义图（如kNN或知识图谱链接）实现多跳、上下文感知的搜索。

Result: 理论分析表明，基于图的检索能改善高维浓度下的语义覆盖，并优于传统邻近检索。

Conclusion: 论文为以语义为中心的向量搜索系统奠定了基础，强调混合索引、多样性感知查询和结构化语义检索的重要性。

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

Method: 结合RAG增强的意图预测器、LLM意图精炼器和意图调制的定位预测器，预测灾害场景下的移动意图和位置。

Result: 实验显示，DisasterMobLLM在Acc@1和F1-score上分别提升32.8%和35.0%。

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM有效解决了灾害场景下人类移动预测的挑战，为灾害预警和救援资源分配提供了支持。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DisasterMobLLM.

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour

Conclusion: 实现有效的FL需更关注边缘设备配置，而非算法复杂性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

Motivation: 解决CLIP在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘和嵌入对齐退化问题，保持其零样本泛化能力。

Method: 使用梯度零空间投影（GNSP）防止任务间干扰，结合知识蒸馏和模态对齐损失稳定多模态嵌入空间。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中取得SOTA性能，成功保持CLIP的模态差距和跨模态检索性能。

Conclusion: GNSP方法有效解决了持续学习中的干扰问题，同时保持了CLIP的原始性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ARPO的新型强化学习算法，用于训练多轮LLM代理，通过熵自适应机制平衡探索与利用，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习算法未能有效平衡LLM的长时推理能力与多轮工具交互能力，导致性能不足。

Method: 提出ARPO算法，结合熵自适应机制和优势估计，动态平衡全局轨迹采样与步级采样。

Result: 在13个基准测试中，ARPO表现优于轨迹级强化学习算法，且仅需一半工具使用预算。

Conclusion: ARPO为LLM代理在动态环境中的对齐提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

TL;DR: CWMI框架通过嵌入因果物理模型，显著提升了LLM在物理推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM缺乏对物理动态的直观理解，限制了其在需要因果推理的实际场景中的有效性。

Method: 引入Causal World Model Induction (CWMI)框架，包含Causal Physics Module (CPM)和Causal Intervention Loss训练目标。

Result: CWMI在零样本物理推理任务（如PIQA和PhysiCa-Bench）中显著优于现有LLM。

Conclusion: 诱导因果世界模型是实现更可靠、通用AI系统的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

Motivation: 地雷清除过程缓慢且资源密集，现有AI方法多关注目标识别，缺乏对空间模式风险预测的研究。

Method: 提出RestoreAI系统，包括线性、曲线和贝叶斯模式清除器，分别基于PCA、主曲线和专家知识进行风险预测。

Result: RestoreAI显著提升清除效率，清除率提高14.37%，时间减少24.45%，线性与曲线模式性能无显著差异。

Conclusion: RestoreAI通过模式预测有效提升地雷清除效率，线性模式可作为高效选择。

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中计算资源受限的问题，避免传统方法需要重新训练整个模型的高计算成本。

Result: CLoRA性能与基线方法相当或更优，同时显著降低硬件需求。

Conclusion: CLoRA适合在资源受限的环境中部署，为持续学习提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

Motivation: 随着图神经网络（GNNs）在联邦学习（FL）中的广泛应用，新的隐私威胁（如样本与客户端的归属关系泄露）亟待研究。

Method: 提出了一个通用攻击框架，利用FedGNNs的聚合行为、梯度更新和嵌入相似性，将样本关联到其源客户端。

Result: 在多个图数据集和实际FL设置下，攻击方法在成员推理和所有权识别上表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦图学习中客户端身份泄露的新隐私威胁，呼吁设计更具鲁棒性的GNN模型。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

TL;DR: DEO是一种基于Dimer方法的新型优化框架，通过一阶梯度信息估计曲率，帮助神经网络训练避开鞍点和平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统一阶优化方法（如SGD和Adam）在复杂损失曲面上表现不佳，而二阶方法计算成本高。DEO旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: DEO利用Dimer方法估计Hessian矩阵的最小特征向量，通过周期性梯度投影避开鞍点和平坦区域。

Result: 在Transformer玩具模型上的初步实验表明，DEO表现优于标准一阶方法。

Conclusion: DEO展示了物理启发的曲率估计在神经网络训练中的潜力。

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

analyzed to assess the impact of data quality on model performance. The study
evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy,
calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and
feature sensitivity. We also explore pre-processing strategies, including KNN
imputation, Gaussian noise injection, and autoencoder-based denoising. The
study reveals critical differences between classical and deep learning models
under realistic conditions, offering practical guidelines for building robust

Motivation: 研究联邦学习（如FedSAM）在数据异构性下的泛化问题，发现其性能下降，需改进算法以提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出FedSWA（基于随机权重平均）和FedMoSWA（动量控制权重平均），旨在异构数据下找到更平坦的最小值并优化模型对齐。

Result: 理论分析证明FedSWA和FedMoSWA的收敛性和泛化性优于FedSAM，实验在CIFAR10/100和Tiny ImageNet上验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: FedSWA和FedMoSWA在异构数据下表现更优，为联邦学习提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

Motivation: 传统k-fold交叉验证中，实例重复使用导致冗余和不平衡，影响学习效果和模型比较。

Method: 通过设计Irredundant k-fold交叉验证，确保每个实例仅用于一次训练和一次测试，保持分层和模型无关性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法性能与传统k-fold相当，但方差估计更保守，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: Irredundant k-fold交叉验证是一种更平衡、高效且可靠的验证方法。

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

Result: 该方法在多种场景（如grokking、神经网络热启动和强化学习任务）中促进了特征学习并提高了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 特征学习动态是克服首要偏差的关键，提高有效学习率是一种有效的实现方法。

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: 基于OT的实例依赖变形方法在几何变化大的数据集中表现优异，显著提升了精度和计算效率。

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Motivation: 在医疗等高风险领域，可靠的策略价值估计需要准确的置信区间，但现有方法缺乏对数据增强带来的偏差的量化。

Method: 提出两种方法：一是基于特定初始状态的策略性能置信区间（使用新的高维状态MDP的共形预测方法），二是基于多初始状态的平均策略性能估计（结合双重稳健估计和预测驱动推断）。

Result: 在机器人、医疗和库存管理的模拟器以及MIMIC-IV的真实医疗数据上，新方法能有效覆盖真实值，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法为数据增强的OPE提供了可靠的置信区间，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 通过模拟和脑电图数据分析验证了SEM的有效性，成功识别了活跃脑区和任务特异性连接模式。

Conclusion: SEM为复杂系统的动态建模提供了新工具，尤其在脑连接分析中展现出潜力。

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

*Adelaide Danilov,Aria Nourbakhsh,Christoph Schommer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合交叉熵损失和深度度量学习目标的新框架（Cluster Purge Loss），用于优化代码处理任务中的嵌入空间结构，提升等效代码突变检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调预训练模型时未能充分结构化嵌入空间以反映类内语义关系，影响等效代码突变检测等任务的性能。

Method: 提出Cluster Purge Loss，动态调整类内边界，结合交叉熵损失，优化嵌入空间。以UniXCoder为基础模型。

Result: 在等效突变检测任务中达到最先进性能，并生成更具解释性的嵌入空间。

Conclusion: 新框架通过优化类内语义关系，显著提升了模型在代码处理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

Conclusion: 该框架为学习复杂数据中的图结构提供了高效且理论保证的方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data
using geometric analysis and nonlinear dynamics. Our approach: (1) Defines
discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs for scalar/vector fields, establishing key
functional properties; (2) Introduces gauge-equivalent nonlinear Schr\"odinger
and Landau--Lifshitz dynamics with provable stable stationary solutions
smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic
gradient algorithm over graph moduli spaces with sparsity regularization.
Theoretically, we guarantee: topological correctness (homology recovery),
metric convergence (Gromov--Hausdorff), and efficient search space utilization.
Our dynamics-based model achieves stronger generalization bounds than standard
neural networks, with complexity dependent on the data manifold's topology.

TL;DR: Meta Fusion是一种灵活的多模态数据融合框架，通过软信息共享提升预测性能，优于传统融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态数据融合方法（早期、中期、晚期融合）各有优缺点，需要一种统一且灵活的框架来提升预测能力。

Method: Meta Fusion基于深度互学习和集成学习，构建多模态潜在表示组合的模型群，并通过软信息共享优化性能。

Result: 理论证明软信息共享降低泛化误差；实验表明Meta Fusion在模拟和实际应用（如阿尔茨海默病检测）中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Meta Fusion为多模态数据融合提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的点积注意力机制计算复杂度高且能耗大，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用Laplacian核卷积值向量，基于查询和键的L1距离计算注意力分数，避免矩阵乘法。

Result: 在NLP、生物信息学和视觉任务中表现相当或优于传统点积注意力，同时能耗显著降低。

Conclusion: EcoTransformer提供了一种高效且节能的注意力机制，适用于多种AI任务。

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

Motivation: 改进传统葡萄酒分析方法，结合光谱和机器学习简化流程，提升感官数据和产地分类的准确性。

Method: 结合紫外-可见光谱和机器学习技术，分两阶段应用于酿酒过程，利用光谱指纹技术和AI。

Result: 支持向量机在属性和产地预测任务中表现最优，准确率和F1分数均超过91%。

Conclusion: 为葡萄酒行业整合大数据和物联网提供新思路，推动‘智能酒庄’发展。

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart
Wineries'.

*Xuanting Xie,Bingheng Li,Erlin Pan,Zhao Kang,Wenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AMLP的无监督框架，通过使MLP适应聚合操作，解决了GNN中固定聚合函数在异质性下表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN通常使用固定的聚合函数（如Mean、Max、Sum），缺乏理论依据，尤其在异质性存在时性能较差。现有方法依赖大量标记数据，而实际任务中标记数据稀缺。

Method: AMLP框架分为两步：1）利用图重构方法实现高阶分组效应；2）使用单层网络编码不同程度的异质性。

Result: 在节点聚类和分类任务上的实验表明，AMLP性能优越。

Conclusion: AMLP为多样化图学习场景提供了一种轻量级且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在结构药物设计（SBDD）中应用受限，主要由于训练数据不足。MEVO旨在填补小分子数据集与蛋白-配体复合物数据集之间的鸿沟。

Method: MEVO包含三个关键组件：高保真VQ-VAE用于分子表示，扩散模型用于药效团引导的分子生成，以及基于物理评分的口袋感知进化策略。

Result: MEVO成功生成了多种蛋白目标的高亲和力结合分子，并在KRASG12D抑制剂设计中表现出与已知高活性抑制剂相当的亲和力。

Conclusion: MEVO是一个高效且数据利用率高的框架，适用于结构配体设计的多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

TL;DR: ASNN通过学习神经网络结构与测试精度之间的关系，提出改进架构，优于随机搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络架构设计通常依赖启发式或搜索方法，缺乏通用闭式函数映射结构与性能关系。

Method: 构建数据集训练ASNN模型，输入精度值，输出架构参数，迭代预测高性能架构。

Result: ASNN在2层和3层架构中均提出优于原始数据的架构，提升平均测试精度。

Conclusion: ASNN为神经网络架构优化提供高效替代方案，有望实现自动化设计。

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于重要性采样的偏移校正方法（IS²C），用于解决部分领域自适应（PDA）中的标签分布偏移问题，并通过理论证明和实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分领域自适应（PDA）中，简单的样本加权方法无法充分利用标记数据且易导致过拟合，需要一种更有效的方法来校正标签分布偏移并提升模型泛化能力。

Method: 提出IS²C方法，通过从构建的采样域中采样新标记数据，其标签分布与目标域一致，以探索潜在结构并增强模型泛化能力。同时，提出基于最优传输的条件分布对齐准则。

Result: 理论证明IS²C能充分主导泛化误差，实验验证其在PDA基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IS²C通过重要性采样和最优传输技术，有效解决了PDA中的标签分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Conclusion: TINs通过将领域知识编码为神经网络结构，推动技术分析进入AI时代。

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in
financial analysis are, in essence, special cases of neural networks with fixed
and interpretable weights. It is shown that nearly all such indicators, such as
moving averages, momentum-based oscillators, volatility bands, and other
commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as
modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Conclusion: Protein-SE(3)为蛋白质结构生成领域提供了标准化评估工具，促进未来算法开发。

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

Conclusion: TLRS通过密集奖励和奖励中心化机制，有效解决了稀疏奖励问题，提升了强化学习在金融领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法能高效利用有限数据，为AI决策提供可靠的覆盖保证。

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了后处理不确定性量化的问题，为神经网络模型提供了更高效的预测区间构建方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

Conclusion: MIPS框架通过多模态建模显著提升了聚合物性质预测的准确性。

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了EduAlign框架，通过奖励模型HPC-RM和GRPO微调，使LLMs更符合教育原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LLMs缺乏教育原则（如帮助性、个性化、创造力）的对齐，EduAlign旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 分两阶段：1）构建8k教育交互数据集并标注HPC维度，训练HPC-RM；2）用HPC-RM奖励信号和GRPO微调LLM。

Result: 微调后模型在教育原则（HPC）和通用领域基准上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: EduAlign为开发更具教育意义的AI导师提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Conclusion: 该概率框架显著改进了因果结构学习，对多领域决策和科学发现有广泛意义。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

the iterative schemes arising from the GD iterations, offering an explanation

Result: 使用纽约Albany的NY CREATES工厂的实际数据验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: PTR框架为晶圆缺陷分析提供了更高效的方法，特别适用于复杂和变长的处理路径。

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

Conclusion: TSA为复杂制造环境中的缺陷根因分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无需预聚类样本时也能成功聚类，且在提供少量样本时性能显著提升，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，是现有聚类技术的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Motivation: 黑洞异常导致数据包丢失且无失败通知，影响网络连接并造成经济损失，需要高效检测方法。

Method: 结合Wasserstein生成对抗网络、注意力机制、LSTM和卷积层，通过潜在空间编码区分异常行为。

Result: 在真实网络数据上测试，F1分数提升1.65%至58.76%，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: WBHT高效且能检测未发现异常，适用于关键网络监控和安全。

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical
networks.

Conclusion: DPPF通过推拉力动态自稳定，理论证明其能引导模型收敛到平坦区域，并提供泛化保证和非凸收敛性。

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

Conclusion: ResCap-DBP展示了将全局蛋白质表示与先进深度学习架构结合的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

Abstract: Multi-omics data offer unprecedented insights into complex biological
systems, yet their high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate interactions
pose significant analytical challenges. Network-based approaches have advanced
multi-omics research by effectively capturing biologically relevant

BioNeuralNet, a flexible and modular Python framework tailored for end-to-end
network-based multi-omics data analysis. BioNeuralNet leverages Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn biologically meaningful low-dimensional
representations from multi-omics networks, converting these complex molecular
networks into versatile embeddings. BioNeuralNet supports all major stages of
multi-omics network analysis, including several network construction
techniques, generation of low-dimensional representations, and a broad range of
downstream analytical tasks. Its extensive utilities, including diverse GNN
architectures, and compatibility with established Python packages (e.g.,
scikit-learn, PyTorch, NetworkX), enhance usability and facilitate quick
adoption. BioNeuralNet is an open-source, user-friendly, and extensively
documented framework designed to support flexible and reproducible multi-omics
network analysis in precision medicine.

Result: 发现注意力动态分阶段变化，Lipschitz常数是关键因素，并推导了不同L值下的收敛时间界限。

Conclusion: Transformer在复杂任务中表现出ICL能力，注意力机制能有效聚焦相关特征。

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Conclusion: WEEP解决了统计性能与计算可行性之间的冲突，为稀疏正则化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在Transformer中至关重要，但其对噪声和虚假相关性的鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 评估了Softmax、Sigmoid、Linear、Doubly Stochastic和Cosine注意力在Vision Transformers中，针对CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Imagenette数据集的数据损坏场景。

Result: Doubly Stochastic注意力表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在数据不完美的情况下选择自注意力机制提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-attention mechanisms are foundational to Transformer architectures,
supporting their impressive success in a wide range of tasks. While there are
many self-attention variants, their robustness to noise and spurious
correlations has not been well studied. This study evaluates Softmax, Sigmoid,
Linear, Doubly Stochastic, and Cosine attention within Vision Transformers
under different data corruption scenarios. Through testing across the CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and Imagenette datasets, we show that Doubly Stochastic attention is
the most robust. Our findings inform self-attention selection in contexts with
imperfect data.

*Liu Zhang,Oscar Mickelin,Sheng Xu,Amit Singer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种对角线加权的广义矩方法（DGMM），解决了高维数据中传统矩方法（MM）和广义矩方法（GMM）的计算和存储复杂度问题，并在弱分离异方差低秩高斯混合模型的参数估计中表现出高效性和数值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩方法（MM）和广义矩方法（GMM）在高维数据或需要高阶矩时，计算和存储复杂度呈指数增长，尤其是GMM还需估计大型加权矩阵，导致计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出对角线加权的广义矩方法（DGMM），通过避免显式计算或存储矩张量，设计了一种计算高效且数值稳定的算法。

Result: 数值研究表明，DGMM在估计误差更小的同时，运行时间显著短于MM和GMM。

Conclusion: DGMM在统计效率、计算复杂度和数值稳定性之间取得了平衡，适用于高维数据的参数估计问题。

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于Shapley值的图稀疏化方法，通过正负贡献评估边重要性，提升GNN推理效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图稀疏化方法仅支持非负重要性评分，限制了其适用性。Shapley值能提供更全面的正负贡献评估，更适合稀疏化任务。

Method: 利用Shapley值计算图中边的正负重要性，通过评估多个子图分配公平的重要性分数，指导稀疏化。

Result: 基于Shapley值的稀疏化在保持预测性能的同时显著降低图复杂度，提升效率和可解释性。

Conclusion: Shapley值为图稀疏化提供了更优策略，兼顾性能和效率，适用于GNN推理。

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的机器学习方法，用于补全卫星降水数据中的缺失区域，解决了传统插值方法导致的空间不连续问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球卫星降水监测（如GSMaP）因微波传感器的轨道特性存在大量缺失区域，现有插值方法常导致空间不连续，亟需改进。

Method: 将降水图补全任务视为视频修复问题，采用基于3D U-Net和3D条件编码器的条件扩散模型，结合红外图像、经纬度网格和物理时间输入。

Result: 在2024年的评估中，该方法生成的降水图比传统方法更具时空一致性。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型有望提升全球降水监测的准确性。

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIAL是一种专为超图设计的主动学习框架，通过将超图主动学习问题重新定义为影响力最大化任务，结合双视角影响力函数和HOI-Aware传播机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图主动学习方法在超图上应用时破坏高阶结构信息，导致性能不佳，因此需要一种原生超图主动学习框架。

Method: HIAL将超图主动学习问题重新定义为影响力最大化任务，提出双视角影响力函数（MoI和EDV）和HOI-Aware传播机制。

Result: 在七个公开数据集上的实验表明，HIAL在性能、效率、通用性和鲁棒性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HIAL为超图主动学习提供了高效且强大的新范式。

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

TL;DR: MoKGR提出了一种混合专家框架，通过个性化路径探索提升知识图谱推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在知识图谱推理中采用固定路径探索策略，难以适应多样化的语言上下文和语义细微差别。

Method: MoKGR包含两个互补组件：长度专家混合（根据查询复杂度自适应选择路径长度）和剪枝专家混合（从互补角度评估候选路径）。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，MoKGR在传导和归纳设置下均表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 个性化路径探索在知识图谱推理中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域离线强化学习通常需要大量目标数据，但现实中目标数据往往有限，导致现有方法难以有效测量域差距。

Method: 提出DmC框架，使用k-NN估计域接近度避免过拟合，并通过最近邻引导的扩散模型生成对齐样本。

Result: 在多种MuJoCo环境中，DmC显著优于现有方法，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: DmC为有限目标数据下的跨域离线强化学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在适应新政策或自定义政策时存在局限性，需要大量重新训练或无法全面整合政策。

Method: 采用基于“先例”的模型判断，结合批判-修订机制收集高质量先例，并利用两种策略进行稳健预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本和全数据集场景下均优于现有方法，且对新政策具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于先例的方法显著提升了护栏的灵活性和适应性，适用于多政策和动态用户标准的需求。

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉高阶图特征和保持特征多样性方面存在不足，MPCCL旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 采用多尺度粗化策略和一对多对比学习范式，结合图重构损失和KL散度确保节点表示的一致性。

Result: 在ACM数据集上NMI提升15.24%，在Citeseer、Cora和DBLP等小规模数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: MPCCL通过创新方法有效解决了图聚类中的关键问题，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,

efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

Conclusion: KOBO方法在样本预算有限的情况下优于现有技术，适用于个性化助听器和生成模型等实际场景。

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

Result: 在多种数据集上，STAFF在补全误差和组公平性之间取得最佳平衡，MSE和MADE分别降低36%和59%。

Conclusion: STAFF是一种有效的张量分解方法，显著提升了组公平性和性能。

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

Motivation: 研究动机在于发现近似遗忘算法未能充分保护未学习数据的隐私，存在新的攻击面。

Method: 提出Reminiscence Attack（ReA）攻击方法，并开发双阶段近似遗忘框架以消除隐私风险。

Result: ReA攻击在推断类级和样本级成员隐私时表现优于现有方法；双阶段框架显著降低攻击准确率。

Conclusion: 双阶段框架在保持高效遗忘的同时，将隐私攻击准确率降至接近随机猜测水平。

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LLM-based NAS方法在搜索策略静态和架构表示模糊上的不足。

Method: 采用动态阶段转换（基于实时分数阈值）和结构化架构模板语言，实现一致代码生成。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-Macro上表现优异；CIFAR-10/100搜索时间减少86%；YOLOv8变体mAP更高且资源成本更低。

Conclusion: PhaseNAS在多种视觉任务中实现了高效、自适应和通用的NAS。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度生成神经网络的方法，用于模拟和估计等位基因频率轨迹，解决了传统模型在连锁不平衡（LD）估计中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计模型（如Wright-Fisher模型）在模拟等位基因频率轨迹时存在简化假设和参数不确定性的问题，而深度生成模型能够整合多变量依赖性和降噪，但尚未广泛应用于群体基因组学。

Method: 作者提出了一种深度生成神经网络模型，通过嵌入单核苷酸多态性（SNPs）及其邻近位点的信息，估计等位基因频率轨迹的分布。

Result: 模型在模拟实验中成功捕捉了等位基因频率轨迹的分布，并在连锁不平衡（LD）估计中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为群体基因组学中的E&R实验提供了一种强大的工具，尤其在处理Pool-Seq数据时表现出显著优势。

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Cholesky分解枢轴选择策略，通过连接贝叶斯非参数推断中的贪婪熵最大化，提高了算法的效率和数值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cholesky分解在对称正定矩阵的线性系统中广泛应用，但其数值稳定性可通过枢轴策略改进。传统方法选择对角线上的最大值作为枢轴，但缺乏灵活性。

Method: 通过连接贝叶斯非参数推断中的贪婪熵最大化，提出新的枢轴选择策略，并设计高效实现。

Result: 新策略在稀疏回归和基于预条件迭代求解器的高斯过程任务中表现优异，多数情况下优于传统方法，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 新枢轴选择策略显著提升了Cholesky分解的效率和数值稳定性，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

Conclusion: 研究为审计人员提供了检测数据操纵的工具，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced

textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance

<details>

Result: 在检索、分类和语义相似度任务上，UEC显著提升了性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UEC通过不确定性建模，为嵌入集成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

Method: 利用RAGTruth语料库的令牌级标注和重现的逻辑值，分析幻觉信号如何依赖于令牌在幻觉跨度中的位置。

Result: 首个幻觉令牌的信号更强且更易检测，而条件性令牌的信号较弱。

Conclusion: 研究改进了对令牌级幻觉的理解，并发布了分析框架和代码。

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病（PD）常导致运动和认知障碍，尤其是步态冻结（FOG）患者。现有检测方法主观或依赖专业设备，需开发客观、数据驱动的多模态模型。

Method: 使用124名参与者的数据（42名PDFOG+、41名PDFOG-、41名健康对照），提取静息态EEG特征和描述性变量，训练新型Bi-cephalic Self-Attention Model（BiSAM），测试三种模态（信号、描述性、多模态）。

Result: 多模态模型表现最佳，BiSAM-8和BiSAM-4的分类准确率达88%，显著优于信号（55%）和描述性（68%）模型。

Conclusion: 结合EEG与描述性特征的多模态模型为PDFOG+检测提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于临床监测和早期诊断。

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

Conclusion: iHOMER是一种鲁棒的在线多标签分类框架，能有效应对动态数据流中的挑战。

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

*Wei Shan Lee,Chi Kiu Althina Chau,Kei Chon Sio,Kam Ian Leong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合傅里叶-神经网络架构，显著提升了物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在四阶偏微分方程中的精度，突破了传统方法的误差限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在四阶偏微分方程中的误差长期停留在$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$，限制了其在工程中的应用。论文旨在突破这一精度瓶颈。

Method: 采用混合傅里叶-神经网络架构，结合截断傅里叶级数和深度神经网络进行残差修正。通过谐波优化研究确定最佳谐波数量，并采用两阶段优化策略（Adam和L-BFGS）及自适应权重平衡。

Result: 在Euler-Bernoulli梁方程中实现了前所未有的L2误差$1.94 \times 10^{-7}$，比标准PINNs提升17倍，比传统数值方法提升15-500倍。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计，可以实现超高精度，为科学计算中机器学习超越传统数值方法开辟了新范式。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

<details>

Motivation: 探索角色分配对模型推理能力的影响，并理解模型如何编码角色特定信息。

Method: 使用激活修补技术分析模型的关键组件，重点关注MLP和MHA层。

Result: 早期MLP层不仅处理输入的语法结构，还处理语义内容；中层MHA层利用这些信息塑造输出。还发现某些注意力头对种族和肤色身份特别关注。

Conclusion: 角色信息通过早期MLP和中层MHA层编码，影响模型推理，某些注意力头可能引入偏见。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注同质结构和简单属性图，无法满足需要语义保真度的应用领域需求，因此需要一种能处理复杂异构图的合成方法。

Method: ProvCreator将图合成任务转化为序列生成任务，采用图到序列的编码-解码器，支持无损编码、高效压缩和端到端可学习的图生成。

Conclusion: ProvCreator为复杂异构图的合成提供了一种高效且语义保真的解决方案，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARSD是一种新型无监督域适应框架，通过表示空间分解实现域适应，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列分析中域偏移问题，现有方法未考虑特征的内在组成。

Method: DARSD包含三个组件：对抗学习公共不变基、原型伪标签机制和混合对比优化策略。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于12种UDA算法，35/53场景表现最佳。

Conclusion: DARSD通过特征解耦和优化策略，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE Debias是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，用于减少T2I扩散模型中的性别偏见，通过稀疏自编码器识别和抑制性别相关方向，无需重新训练或修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I扩散模型常表现出性别偏见，生成职业与性别的刻板关联，现有方法依赖CLIP过滤或提示工程，效果有限且需模型特定调整。

Method: 利用预训练的k稀疏自编码器在性别偏见数据上识别稀疏潜在空间中的性别相关方向，构建职业偏见方向并在推理时抑制，实现性别平衡生成。

Result: 在多个T2I模型（如Stable Diffusion系列）上验证，SAE Debias显著减少性别偏见且保持生成质量。

Conclusion: SAE Debias是首个利用稀疏自编码器干预T2I性别偏见的工作，为构建公平的生成AI提供了可解释且模型无关的工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要依赖GPU云基础设施，而SmallThinker旨在解决本地设备的计算能力弱、内存有限和存储慢的问题。

Method: 采用两级稀疏结构（MoE与稀疏前馈网络）、预注意力路由器和NoPE-RoPE混合稀疏注意力机制，优化计算、存储和内存效率。

Result: SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B和SmallThinker-21B-A3B在性能上超越更大模型，并在普通CPU上实现高效推理（20 tokens/s），内存占用极低。

Conclusion: SmallThinker通过原生设计成功将高性能LLM部署到本地设备，减少对GPU的依赖，为边缘计算提供新可能。

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at
hf.co/PowerInfer/SmallThinker-4BA0.6B-Instruct and

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用非结构化数据估计个性化治疗效果的方法，解决了现有方法依赖结构化数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖结构化协变量，限制了其在非结构化数据（如医疗记录或图像）中的应用。利用非结构化数据进行因果推断具有巨大潜力。

Method: 提出了一种基于神经表示的'插件'方法，并引入两种理论支持的估计器以避免混杂偏差。进一步提出回归校正方法解决非代表性子集的采样偏差问题。

Result: 实验表明，插件方法在非结构化数据上表现良好，尽管简单但适用于多种场景。

Conclusion: 该方法为非结构化数据中的因果推断提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器学习部署中，模型需持续更新、组合和选择性撤销，但现有方法存在任务干扰、灾难性遗忘或不可逆性问题。

Method: 将任务特定模型编码为共享基的增量，投影到正交子空间消除冲突，通过梯度优化合并为统一模型。

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MDM-OC在准确性、反向迁移和撤销保真度上优于基线，且内存高效。

Conclusion: MDM-OC为模块化和合规AI系统设计提供了原则性解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法未明确针对不同响应需求定制数据和参数，受《思考快与慢》启发，提出双系统分区方法。

Method: 分类任务数据并通过角色扮演和投票分区参数，采用SFT和RL两阶段微调策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少参数使用的同时，性能匹配或超越现有PEFT基线。

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR框架通过双系统分区和两阶段微调，实现了高效且高性能的模型微调。

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: CFNs结合了深度学习的表达能力和数学函数的可解释性，为高性能与透明性并重的应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly

this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

### [310] [When Brain Foundation Model Meets Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence: A New Framework for Cross-Subject Motor Imagery Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21037)
*Jinzhou Wu,Baoping Tang,Qikang Li,Yi Wang,Cheng Li,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于预训练大脑基础模型（BFM）的多源域适应框架，用于动态选择相关源域，并通过特征和决策级对齐提升MI-EEG解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MI-EEG解码中因主体间差异大和标记数据少导致的负迁移和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 利用BFM动态选择源域，结合Cauchy-Schwarz和条件CS散度进行特征与决策级对齐。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上优于现有方法，BFM选择显著减少训练时间且不降低性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了MI-EEG解码中的挑战，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

Motivation: 探索Transformer的概率解释，揭示其初始化行为及内部机制，以改进模型性能。

Method: 基于ProbDR框架，将Transformer解释为概率Laplacian Eigenmaps模型的推理步骤，分析其初始化行为及图Laplacian项的作用。

Result: 实验表明，调整注意力矩阵（减去单位矩阵）可提升语言模型和简单视觉Transformer的验证性能。

Conclusion: 论文为Transformer提供了新的概率视角，揭示了其内部机制，并通过简单调整注意力矩阵验证了改进效果。

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rep-MTL提出了一种新的多任务学习方法，通过利用表示空间的任务显著性来量化任务间的交互，从而促进互补信息共享，而非单纯解决冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务优化方法主要关注通过优化器解决任务冲突，但忽视了表示空间中任务交互的潜力。Rep-MTL旨在利用这一潜力，促进任务间的互补性。

Method: Rep-MTL通过熵惩罚和样本级跨任务对齐来引导任务显著性，以量化任务特定优化与共享表示学习之间的交互。

Result: 在四个多任务基准测试中，Rep-MTL表现出色，即使与基本权重策略结合也能取得竞争性性能提升。

Conclusion: Rep-MTL通过平衡任务特定学习和跨任务共享，有效提升了多任务学习的性能。

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

TL;DR: Flow Policy Optimization (FPO) 是一种基于流的强化学习算法，将流匹配引入策略梯度框架，无需精确似然计算，适用于多种连续控制任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将流匹配的优势融入强化学习策略优化，解决高斯策略在多模态动作分布中的局限性。

Method: FPO 通过优势加权比计算条件流匹配损失，与 PPO-clip 框架兼容，不依赖特定采样方法。

Result: FPO 在连续控制任务中表现优异，流模型能捕捉多模态动作分布，性能优于高斯策略。

Conclusion: FPO 提供了一种灵活且高效的流策略优化方法，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

Method: 引入了一种新的谱稀疏化概念（度平衡保持谱近似），并设计了动态算法，实现了对数级的摊销更新时间和稀疏化效果。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在动态有向图稀疏化方面取得了显著进展，为实际应用提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: Recent years have seen extensive research on directed graph sparsification.
In this work, we initiate the study of fast fully dynamic spectral and cut
sparsification algorithms for directed graphs.
  We introduce a new notion of spectral sparsification called degree-balance
preserving spectral approximation, which maintains the difference between the
in-degree and out-degree of each vertex. The approximation error is measured
with respect to the corresponding undirected Laplacian. This notion is
equivalent to direct Eulerian spectral approximation when the input graph is
Eulerian. Our algorithm achieves an amortized update time of
$O(\varepsilon^{-2} \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ and produces a sparsifier of size
$O(\varepsilon^{-2} n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$. Additionally, we present an
algorithm that maintains a constant-factor approximation sparsifier of size
$O(n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ against an adaptive adversary for
$O(\text{polylog}(n))$-partially symmetrized graphs, a notion introduced in
[Kyng-Meierhans-Probst Gutenberg '22]. A $\beta$-partial symmetrization of a
directed graph $\vec{G}$ is the union of $\vec{G}$ and $\beta \cdot G$, where
$G$ is the corresponding undirected graph of $\vec{G}$. This algorithm also
achieves a polylogarithmic amortized update time.
  Moreover, we develop a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a cut
sparsifier for $\beta$-balanced directed graphs, where the ratio between
weighted incoming and outgoing edges of any cut is at most $\beta$. This
algorithm explicitly maintains a cut sparsifier of size
$O(\varepsilon^{-2}\beta n \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$ in worst-case update time
$O(\varepsilon^{-2}\beta \cdot \text{polylog}(n))$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线资源分配问题中的可重用性，解决决策者在管理有限资源时面临的动态请求序列问题。

Method: 对于kRental-Fixed，采用基于价格的分数分配和新型无损在线舍入方案；对于kRental-Variable，提出有限相关舍入技术和价格方法。

Result: kRental-Fixed实现了最优竞争比；kRental-Variable通过有限相关舍入和价格方法达到了接近最优的竞争比。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法在两种问题中均表现出色，为在线资源分配问题提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study two online resource-allocation problems with reusability in an
adversarial setting, namely kRental-Fixed and kRental-Variable. In both
problems, a decision-maker manages $k$ identical reusable units and faces a
sequence of rental requests over time. We develop theoretically grounded
relax-and-round algorithms with provable competitive-ratio guarantees for both
settings. For kRental-Fixed, we present an optimal randomized algorithm that
attains the best possible competitive ratio: it first computes an optimal
fractional allocation via a price-based approach, then applies a novel lossless
online rounding scheme to obtain an integral solution. For kRental-Variable, we
prove that lossless online rounding is impossible. We introduce a
limited-correlation rounding technique that treats each unit independently
while introducing controlled dependencies across allocation decisions involving
the same unit. Coupled with a carefully crafted price-based method for
computing the fractional allocation, this yields an order-optimal competitive
ratio for the variable-duration setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dor等人的算法在顶点对距离至少k时有效，但实际应用中可能无法满足这一条件。本文旨在放宽这一限制，使算法适用于更近的顶点对。

Method: 提出了一种组合随机化算法，适用于顶点对仅需O(log k)距离的情况，运行时间与Dor等人算法相似。

Result: 算法在顶点对距离O(log k)时仍保持近似最短路径的准确性，运行时间为~O(n^{2+1/k})，当k=log n时，运行时间降至~O(n^2)。

Conclusion: 本文首次在25年后改进了Dor等人的结果，扩展了算法的适用范围，同时保持了高效性。

Abstract: An influential result by Dor, Halperin, and Zwick (FOCS 1996, SICOMP 2000)
implies an algorithm that can compute approximate shortest paths for all vertex
pairs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2+O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right )})$ time, ensuring that the
output distance is at most twice the actual shortest path, provided the pairs
are at least $k$ apart, where $k \ge 2$. We present the first improvement on
this result in over 25 years. Our algorithm achieves roughly same
$\tilde{O}(n^{2+\frac{1}{k}})$ runtime but applies to vertex pairs merely
$O(\log k)$ apart, where $\log k \ge 1$. When $k=\log n$, the running time of
our algorithm is $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ and it works for all pairs at least $O(\log
\log n)$ apart. Our algorithm is combinatorial, randomized, and returns correct
results for all pairs with a high probability.

Motivation: 现有SRI基准实例通常解较少或不满足条件，难以用于评估解决平等主义SRI等难变体的方法。

Method: 引入一种新算法，生成具有大量稳定匹配解的SRI基准实例。

Result: 生成的实例具有大量稳定匹配解，难以通过枚举找到平等主义稳定匹配。

Conclusion: 新算法为评估解决难变体SRI的方法提供了更有效的基准实例。

Abstract: While the existence of a stable matching for the stable roommates problem
possibly with incomplete preference lists (SRI) can be decided in polynomial
time, SRI problems with some fairness criteria are intractable. Egalitarian SRI
that tries to maximize the total satisfaction of agents if a stable matching
exists, is such a hard variant of SRI. For experimental evaluations of methods
to solve these hard variants of SRI, several well-known algorithms have been
used to randomly generate benchmark instances. However, these benchmark
instances are not always satisfiable, and usually have a small number of stable
matchings if one exists. For such SRI instances, despite the NP-hardness of
Egalitarian SRI, it is practical to find an egalitarian stable matching by
enumerating all stable matchings. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm
to generate benchmark instances for SRI that have very large numbers of
solutions, and for which it is hard to find an egalitarian stable matching by
enumerating all stable matchings.

Motivation: 尽管HAC在单调连接函数中已有高效并行算法，但非单调连接函数（如质心和Ward距离）的并行算法仍未被研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Conclusion: 本文为非单调连接函数的HAC提供了高效并行算法，并揭示了其在高维空间中的计算限制。

Abstract: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is an extensively studied and
widely used method for hierarchical clustering in $\mathbb{R}^k$ based on
repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters according to an input linkage
function $d$. Highly parallel (i.e., NC) algorithms are known for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC (where near-minimum rather than minimum pairs
are merged) for certain linkage functions that monotonically increase as merges
are performed. However, no such algorithms are known for many important but
non-monotone linkage functions such as centroid and Ward's linkage.
  In this work, we show that a general class of non-monotone linkage functions
-- which include centroid and Ward's distance -- admit efficient NC algorithms
for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate HAC in low dimensions. Our algorithms are based
on a structural result which may be of independent interest: the height of the
hierarchy resulting from any constant-approximate HAC on $n$ points for this
class of linkage functions is at most $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$ as long as
$k = O(\log \log n / \log \log \log n)$. Complementing our upper bounds, we
show that NC algorithms for HAC with these linkage functions in
\emph{arbitrary} dimensions are unlikely to exist by showing that HAC is
CC-hard when $d$ is centroid distance and $k = n$.

Abstract: Adaptive binary search trees are a fundamental data structure for organizing
hierarchical information. Their ability to dynamically adjust to access
patterns makes them particularly valuable for building responsive and efficient
networked and distributed systems.
  We present a unified framework for adaptive binary search trees with fixed
restructuring cost, analyzed under two models: the single-source model, where
the cost of querying a node is proportional to its distance from a fixed
source, and the all-to-all model, where the cost of serving a request depends
on the distance between the source and destination nodes. We propose an offline
algorithm for the single-source model and extend it to the all-to-all model.
For both models, we prove upper bounds on the cost incurred by our algorithms.
Furthermore, we show the existence of input sequences for which any offline
algorithm must incur a cost comparable to ours.
  In the online setting, we develop a general mathematical framework for
deterministic online adaptive binary search trees and propose a deterministic
online strategy for the single-source case, which naturally extends to the
all-to-all model. We also establish lower bounds on the competitive ratio of
any deterministic online algorithm, highlighting fundamental limitations of
online adaptivity.

Abstract: When an old apartment building is demolished and rebuilt, how can we fairly
redistribute the new apartments to minimize envy among residents? We reduce
this question to a combinatorial optimization problem called the *Min Max
Average Cycle Weight* problem. In that problem we seek to assign objects to
agents in a way that minimizes the maximum average weight of directed cycles in
an associated envy graph. While this problem reduces to maximum-weight matching
when starting from a clean slate (achieving polynomial-time solvability), we
show that this is not the case when we account for preexisting conditions, such
as residents' satisfaction with their original apartments. Whether the problem
is polynomial-time solvable in the general case remains an intriguing open
problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自1992年Blum和Rudich提出poly(n,2^k)时间算法以来，k-term DNF学习问题一直未有显著改进。本文旨在突破这一限制。

Method: 结合Winnow2算法、增强特征空间、属性高效学习算法、junta测试技术以及极值多项式和噪声算子等新工具。

Result: 实现了poly(n)⋅2^Õ(√k)的运行时间，显著优于之前的poly(n,2^k)结果。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入新工具和技术，首次在k-term DNF学习问题上取得了自1992年以来的实质性进展。

Abstract: In 1992 Blum and Rudich [BR92] gave an algorithm that uses membership and
equivalence queries to learn $k$-term DNF formulas over $\{0,1\}^n$ in time
$\textsf{poly}(n,2^k)$, improving on the naive $O(n^k)$ running time that can
be achieved without membership queries [Val84]. Since then, many alternative
algorithms [Bsh95, Kus97, Bsh97, BBB+00] have been given which also achieve
runtime $\textsf{poly}(n,2^k)$.
  We give an algorithm that uses membership and equivalence queries to learn
$k$-term DNF formulas in time $\textsf{poly}(n) \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k})}$.
This is the first improvement for this problem since the original work of Blum
and Rudich [BR92].
  Our approach employs the Winnow2 algorithm for learning linear threshold
functions over an enhanced feature space which is adaptively constructed using
membership queries. It combines a strengthened version of a technique that
effectively reduces the length of DNF terms from the original work of [BR92]
with a range of additional algorithmic tools (attribute-efficient learning
algorithms for low-weight linear threshold functions and techniques for finding
relevant variables from junta testing) and analytic ingredients (extremal
polynomials and noise operators) that are novel in the context of query-based
DNF learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gomory-Hu树是一种保留图中所有顶点对最小割的树结构，但其构建算法的效率一直是挑战。本文旨在提供一种更高效的确定性算法。

Method: 通过两个新颖的组件实现：1）将全对最小割问题确定性降维到单源最小割问题，仅引入次多项式开销；2）提出一种确定性几乎线性时间的单源最小割算法。

Result: 首次实现了$m^{1+o(1)}$时间的确定性Gomory-Hu树构建算法，并解决了更简单问题（如$k$-边连通分量）的几乎线性时间确定性算法。

Conclusion: 本文的创新性工具为确定性算法设计提供了新思路，显著提升了Gomory-Hu树构建的效率。

Abstract: Given an $m$-edge, undirected, weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$, a Gomory-Hu tree
$T$ (Gomory and Hu, 1961) is a tree over the vertex set $V$ such that all-pairs
mincuts in $G$ are preserved exactly in $T$.
  In this article, we give the first almost-optimal $m^{1+o(1)}$-time
deterministic algorithm for constructing a Gomory-Hu tree. Prior to our work,
the best deterministic algorithm for this problem dated back to the original
algorithm of Gomory and Hu that runs in $nm^{1+o(1)}$ time (using current
maxflow algorithms). In fact, this is the first almost-linear time
deterministic algorithm for even simpler problems, such as finding the
$k$-edge-connected components of a graph.
  Our new result hinges on two separate and novel components that each
introduce a distinct set of de-randomization tools of independent interest:
  - a deterministic reduction from the all-pairs mincuts problem to the
single-souce mincuts problem incurring only subpolynomial overhead, and
  - a deterministic almost-linear time algorithm for the single-source mincuts
problem.

Conclusion: AMCFG为视频流行度预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，基于稳定原则而非短暂信号。

Abstract: Predicting online video popularity faces a critical challenge: prediction
drift, where models trained on historical data rapidly degrade due to evolving
viral trends and user behaviors. To address this temporal distribution shift,
we propose an Anchored Multi-modal Clustering and Feature Generation (AMCFG)
framework that discovers temporally-invariant patterns across data
distributions. Our approach employs multi-modal clustering to reveal content
structure, then leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic
Anchor Features, such as audience demographics, content themes, and engagement
patterns that transcend superficial trend variations. These semantic anchors,
combined with cluster-derived statistical features, enable prediction based on
stable principles rather than ephemeral signals. Experiments demonstrate that
AMCFG significantly enhances both predictive accuracy and temporal robustness,
achieving superior performance on out-of-distribution data and providing a
viable solution for real-world video popularity prediction.

Conclusion: 多条件引导的V2M框架有效解决了现有方法的不足，提升了音乐生成的质量和用户满意度。

Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic
video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely
on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a
black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework
that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over
music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables
learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while
meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we
introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal
alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the
second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a
control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately
guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective
evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user
expectations.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化多模态蒸馏框架（DSoM），通过利用非目标实体的暗知识和动态选择多模态教师来解决现有多模态知识图谱推理（MKGR）方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MKGR方法忽视实体标签的概率相关性，且静态或自适应地整合所有模态，忽略了无关或误导性信息的负面影响。

Method: 提出DSoM框架，包括：（1）通过logit蒸馏利用非目标实体的暗知识；（2）动态选择最优多模态教师组合。

Result: 在5个MKGR数据集上验证了DSoM的有效性。

Conclusion: DSoM框架通过利用暗知识和动态模态选择，显著提升了多模态知识图谱推理的性能。

Abstract: The multimodal knowledge graph reasoning (MKGR) task aims to predict the
missing facts in the incomplete MKGs by leveraging auxiliary images and
descriptions of entities. Existing approaches are trained with single-target
objectives, which neglect the probabilistic correlations of entity labels,
especially in non-target entities. Moreover, previous studies incorporate all
modalities statically or adaptively, overlooking the negative impacts of
irrelevant or misleading information in the incompetent modalities. To address
these issues, we introduce a novel Reinforced Multimodal Distillation
framework, exploiting the Dark Side of Modalities (DSoM) from two perspectives:
(1) Dark knowledge from non-target entities: We propose to train a unimodal KGR
model through logit distillation to mimic the multimodal soft labels provided
by pre-trained multimodal teacher models. The multimodal soft labels could
provide rich supervision signals with subtle correlations among both target and
non-target entities from multiple perspectives. We further decouple logits into
neighbor entities and non-neighbor entities to divide into two types of
correlations. (2) Dark side in unhelpful modalities: To exclude the adverse
effects of unhelpful modalities, we introduce a reinforced teacher combination
mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal set of multimodal teachers for
each triple. The agent is trained to maximize the rewards, which are only
assigned to the beneficial multimodal combination strategies for the student
model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DSoM
framework on 5 MKGR datasets. Codes are available at github.com/OreOZhao/DSoM.

*Ziyu Zhang,Yuanhao Wei,Joshua Engels,Julian Shun*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了CleANN系统，解决了动态图索引在更新和查询时的性能与质量问题，实现了高效的并发处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图索引在数据更新时存在查询质量下降或更新成本高的问题，需要一种高效支持动态更新的解决方案。

Method: CleANN系统包含三个组件：工作负载感知链接、查询自适应邻居整合和半延迟内存清理。

Result: 在7个数据集上测试，CleANN在保持查询质量的同时，实现了7-1200倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: CleANN是首个在完全动态场景下保持高效和质量的并发ANNS索引。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) has become a quintessential
algorithmic problem for various other foundational data tasks for AI workloads.
Graph-based ANNS indexes have superb empirical trade-offs in indexing cost,
query efficiency, and query approximation quality. Most existing graph-based
indexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the
data after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,
deletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in
applications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently
supports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based
indexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query
quality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to
maintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve
these problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main
components: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to
combat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood
consolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory
cleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the
work spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse
datasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at
least as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding
data. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of
queries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x
throughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, CleANN is the first concurrent ANNS index to achieve such efficiency
while maintaining quality under full dynamism.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: TIMEST是一种快速、准确的算法，用于估计时态网络中任意大小的时态模体数量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界网络中的边通常带有时间戳，时态模体挖掘需求迫切，但现有算法难以处理大规模时态模体计数问题。

Method: 提出TIMEST算法，使用时态生成树采样器和加权采样技术，结合随机估计方法高效计数时态模体。

Result: TIMEST在速度和准确性上均优于现有算法，CPU实现比GPU精确算法快28倍，误差低于5%。

Conclusion: TIMEST为解决大规模时态模体计数问题提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The mining of pattern subgraphs, known as motifs, is a core task in the field
of graph mining. Edges in real-world networks often have timestamps, so there
is a need for temporal motif mining. A temporal motif is a richer structure
that imposes timing constraints on the edges of the motif. Temporal motifs have
been used to analyze social networks, financial transactions, and biological
networks.
  Motif counting in temporal graphs is particularly challenging. A graph with
millions of edges can have trillions of temporal motifs, since the same edge
can occur with multiple timestamps. There is a combinatorial explosion of
possibilities, and state-of-the-art algorithms cannot manage motifs with more
than four vertices.
  In this work, we present TIMEST: a general, fast, and accurate estimation
algorithm to count temporal motifs of arbitrary sizes in temporal networks. Our
approach introduces a temporal spanning tree sampler that leverages weighted
sampling to generate substructures of target temporal motifs. This method
carefully takes a subset of temporal constraints of the motif that can be
jointly and efficiently sampled. TIMEST uses randomized estimation techniques
to obtain accurate estimates of motif counts.
  We give theoretical guarantees on the running time and approximation
guarantees of TIMEST. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and show
that TIMEST is both faster and more accurate than previous algorithms. Our CPU
implementation exhibits an average speedup of 28x over state-of-the-art GPU
implementation of the exact algorithm, and 6x speedup over SOTA approximate
algorithms while consistently showcasing less than 5% error in most cases. For
example, TIMEST can count the number of instances of a financial fraud temporal
motif in four minutes with 0.6% error, while exact methods take more than two
days.

Motivation: 解决SQL的局限性（如NULL值、阻抗不匹配、SQL注入等）并提供更强大的查询能力，同时与现代编程语言无缝结合。

Method: 设计功能数据模型（FDM）和功能查询语言（FQL），使其比关系模型和SQL更具表达力，并与编程语言统一。

Result: FQL解决了SQL的诸多问题，提供了更强大的查询能力，并与编程语言无缝集成，优化了编译器与数据库的协作。

Conclusion: FDM和FQL为数据库查询提供了更现代、更灵活的解决方案，同时保持了开发者的编程习惯。

Abstract: We propose the vision of a functional data model (FDM) and an associated
functional query language (FQL). Our proposal has far-reaching consequences: we
show a path to come up with a modern QL that solves (almost if not) all
problems of SQL (NULL-values, impedance mismatch, SQL injection, missing
querying capabilities for updates, etc.). FDM and FQL are much more expressive
than the relational model and SQL. In addition, in contrast to SQL, FQL
integrates smoothly into existing programming languages. In our approach both
QL and PL become the "same thing", thus opening up some interesting holistic
optimization opportunities between compilers and databases. In FQL, we also do
not need to force application developers to switch to unfamiliar programming
paradigms (like SQL or datalog): developers can stick with the abstractions
provided by their programming language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺失值常限制数据分析或导致结果失真，但缺乏通用的MVI方法，需结合整体数据分析环境。

Result: 通过不同数据验证框架，展示各MVI方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: MVIAnalyzer为MVI提供全面分析工具，可视化辅助理解复杂影响因素。

Abstract: Missing values often limit the usage of data analysis or cause falsification
of results. Therefore, methods of missing value imputation (MVI) are of great
significance. However, in general, there is no universal, fair MVI method for
different tasks. This work thus places MVI in the overall context of data
analysis. For this purpose, we present the MVIAnalyzer, a generic framework for
a holistic analysis of MVI. It considers the overall process up to the
application and analysis of machine learning methods. The associated software
is provided and can be used by other researchers for their own analyses. To
this end, it further includes a missing value simulation with consideration of
relevant parameters. The application of the MVIAnalyzer is demonstrated on data
with different characteristics. An evaluation of the results shows the
possibilities and limitations of different MVI methods. Since MVI is a very
complex topic with different influencing variables, this paper additionally
illustrates how the analysis can be supported by visualizations.

Motivation: 数据流（如传感器数据）可能包含错误，需清洗后再使用。现有研究多关注静态数据清洗，而数据流清洗的特殊性尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，使用原型框架评估数据流清洗的适用性。

Result: 实验表明数据流清洗存在不一致性，并提出了对流技术的要求。

Conclusion: 数据流清洗具有特殊性，需进一步研究以满足实际需求。

Abstract: Streaming data can arise from a variety of contexts. Important use cases are
continuous sensor measurements such as temperature, light or radiation values.
In the process, streaming data may also contain data errors that should be
cleaned before further use. Many studies from science and practice focus on
data cleaning in a static context. However, in terms of data cleaning,
streaming data has particularities that distinguish it from static data. In
this paper, we have therefore undertaken an intensive exploration of data
cleaning of data streams. We provide a detailed analysis of the applicability
of data cleaning to data streams. Our theoretical considerations are evaluated
in comprehensive experiments. Using a prototype framework, we show that
cleaning is not consistent when working with data streams. An additional
contribution is the investigation of requirements for streaming technologies in
context of data cleaning.

Result: 在银行、航班和医疗领域测试中，WARPP优于非个性化方法和ReAct基线，尤其在复杂意图下表现更优。

Conclusion: WARPP显著提升工作流执行效率和准确性，同时减少资源消耗，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

Motivation: 传统博弈论假设理性、完全信息和共同知识，而现实多智能体系统常存在不确定性和认知差异。超博弈理论通过建模主观感知来弥补这些不足。

Method: 通过系统回顾44项研究，引入超博弈理论及其扩展（分层超博弈和HNF），提出智能体兼容性标准和分类框架。

Conclusion: 本文为超博弈理论在动态多智能体环境中的应用提供了新路线图，强调了增强战略建模的现实性和有效性。

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: DeltaLLM是一种无需训练的动态注意力剪枝框架，适用于资源受限的边缘设备，通过时间稀疏性和上下文感知混合注意力机制提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在边缘设备上部署时因计算复杂度高而不适用的问题。

Method: 利用时间稀疏性构建Delta矩阵，结合局部上下文窗口的完整注意力和外部Delta近似。

Result: 在BitNet和Llama模型上实现高达60%的注意力稀疏性，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: DeltaLLM为边缘设备上的高效推理提供了无需微调的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

Motivation: 现实应用中稳定室友问题不一定总有解，因此需要找到“足够好”的匹配方案。

Method: 结合代理的习惯、偏好及其朋友网络，生成个性化的稳定室友匹配方案。

Result: 通过示例和实证评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决稳定室友问题提供了实用且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the
evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

Conclusion: 本体结构知识图谱结合改进的概率模型能有效预测未来事件，为决策提供支持。

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

Result: LLM的学习机制可能导致错误累积和信息灾难，且数据规模增大会加剧虚假相关性。

Conclusion: 为避免LLM的退化路径，需更重视问题结构特征的理解和洞察。

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

TL;DR: 论文研究了内在动机（IM）方法在强化学习（RL）中的行为影响，发现IM会导致奖励黑客问题，并提出广义奖励匹配（GRM）作为缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏环境中的奖励稀疏性对RL代理构成挑战，IM方法虽能促进探索，但可能引发奖励黑客问题，目前缺乏对IM行为影响的实证研究。

Method: 在MiniGrid环境中评估三种IM技术的行为影响，并与GRM方法对比，GRM能保证最优性。

Result: IM显著改变了代理的行为，提高了初始奖励，但也导致奖励黑客问题；GRM在部分场景中缓解了这一问题。

Conclusion: IM对RL代理行为有显著影响，GRM是一种潜在解决方案，但需进一步研究其适用性。

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出首个可实现的修正性框架，在多步、部分可观测环境中提供可证明的保障，通过五个独立效用头实现严格的安全性和人类利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如Constitutional AI或RLHF/RLAIF）将规范合并为单一标量的局限性，确保在激励冲突时仍能优先服从和限制影响。

Method: 采用五个结构分离的效用头（如服从性、低影响行为等），通过严格权重间隙按字典序组合，并在部分可观测环境中提供理论证明。

Result: Theorem 1和Theorem 3分别证明了单轮和多步修正性，即使效用头学习存在误差，安全性仍可保障。此外，证明了开放环境中修正性验证的不可判定性，并划定了可判定范围。

Conclusion: 该框架将风险转移至评估质量而非隐藏激励泄漏，为当前LLM助手和未来自主系统提供了更清晰的实现指导。

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypKG框架通过整合电子健康记录（EHRs）和知识图谱（KGs），生成上下文知识表示，提升医疗预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用知识图谱缺乏患者特定上下文，而电子健康记录提供丰富个人数据，结合两者可优化精准医疗。

Method: 使用实体链接技术连接KGs和EHRs，采用超图模型和超图变换器学习上下文表示。

Result: 实验显示HypKG在多指标下显著提升医疗预测性能，并能优化知识图谱实体和关系表示。

Conclusion: HypKG通过整合上下文信息，提升了知识图谱的实用性和医疗预测的准确性。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

TL;DR: ASPBench是一个针对答案集编程（ASP）的全面基准测试，揭示了当前大型语言模型（LLM）在ASP核心任务上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM在ASP中能力的评估过于简化，缺乏支持复杂逻辑（如否定、析取、多答案集）的基准测试。

Method: 引入ASPBench，包含三个ASP特定任务：ASP蕴含、答案集验证和答案集计算。

Result: 14个先进LLM在前两个简单任务上表现较好，但在核心的答案集计算任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在ASP解决中仍有局限性，需要更有效地整合符号推理能力。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/HomuraT/ASPBench.

Motivation: 解决非稳态市场中供应链优化的复杂问题，同时平衡经济、环境和社会目标。

Method: 采用多目标强化学习（RL）方法，并与改进的单目标RL算法和多目标进化算法（MOEA）进行对比。

Result: 主要方法在最优性、多样性和密度方面表现最佳，复杂场景下超体积比MOEA方法高75%，解密度是改进单目标RL方法的11倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在供应链优化中实现了稳健的生产和库存管理，同时最小化需求损失。

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法，用于自动从MRI/CT报告中提取胰腺囊性病变（PCL）特征并分类风险，性能接近GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动提取PCL特征耗时且难以大规模研究，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成的链式思维（CoT）数据微调开源LLM（LLaMA和DeepSeek），并基于指南映射风险类别。

Result: 微调后模型特征提取准确率显著提升（LLaMA 80%→97%，DeepSeek 79%→98%），风险分类F1分数接近GPT-4o（0.95-0.97），且与放射科医生一致性高。

Conclusion: CoT监督的微调开源LLM能高效、准确地支持大规模PCL研究，性能媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法因缺乏理论支持，难以生成因果不变提示，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: DiCap利用扩散过程从因果模型的边际和条件分布中迭代采样梯度，生成满足最小充分性准则的反事实提示，并结合对比学习框架优化提示提取。

Result: 实验表明，DiCap在图像分类、图文检索和视觉问答等任务中表现优异，尤其在未见类别上优势明显。

Conclusion: DiCap通过理论驱动的反事实提示生成和对比学习，显著提升了提示学习的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示AI与人类认知的不可分割性，强调在AI设计中必须正视人类认知的作用，以避免技术对认知科学的扭曲和对人性化AI的限制。

Method: 通过对比技术与人认知的例子（如算盘与心算、闹钟与敲窗人），提出新的定义和分析框架，将社会技术关系分为有害的替代、有益的增强和中性取代。

Result: 分析表明，所有AI都涉及人类认知，模糊认知会导致批判性思考的减缓、认知科学的扭曲，并限制AI系统真正以人为中心的设计。

Conclusion: 为了真正实现以人为中心的AI，必须正视人类在AI中的作用，避免对技术的盲目崇拜，以促进更人性化的AI工程。

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

Motivation: 新兴应用（如全息通信、自动驾驶和工业物联网）对6G网络的资源分配提出了灵活、低延迟和高可靠性的要求，传统方法在动态环境中表现不佳，且实时信道状态信息（CSI）获取成本高。

Method: 利用数字孪生信道（DTC）通过环境感知预测CSI，并结合轻量级博弈论算法进行在线资源分配。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法比基于导频的理想CSI方案吞吐量提升高达11.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法验证了在6G网络中实现可扩展、低开销和环境感知通信的有效性。

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Result: 概念性框架展示了如何通过结构化对话和网络分析实现AI的透明推理和用户偏好整合。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来开发可解释、透明的AI系统提供了方向，有助于提升AI在决策中的可信度。

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

TL;DR: PITA框架通过直接整合用户偏好反馈到LLM的token生成中，无需预训练奖励模型，降低了计算成本并提高了稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练的奖励模型，可能导致不稳定，PITA旨在消除这一依赖。

Method: PITA通过学习小型偏好引导策略，在推理时修改token概率，无需微调LLM。

Result: 在数学推理和情感分类等任务中，PITA有效对齐LLM输出与用户偏好。

Conclusion: PITA提供了一种高效、稳定的方法，直接整合用户偏好，无需依赖奖励模型。

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

Motivation: 尽管神经网络在多智能体强化学习（MARL）中取得进展，但其黑盒特性导致合作机制不透明且难以理解。

Method: 提出CMQ方法，通过监督向量表示合作概念，利用全局状态嵌入条件化个体动作值，增强合作表示能力。

Result: 在StarCraft II和LBF任务中，CMQ性能优于现有方法，并能捕捉有意义的合作模式。

Conclusion: CMQ通过显式学习合作概念，解决了性能与可解释性之间的权衡问题，支持概念干预以检测合作偏差。

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

Result: 研究发现策略脆弱性源于非唯一最优动作，熵正则化可恢复稳定性但增加随机性。

Conclusion: 该框架为设计更安全、可信的AI系统提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

Result: HFrame能区分更多非同态图对，速度比精确匹配算法快101.91倍，平均准确率0.962。

Conclusion: HFrame在子图同态问题中表现优异，兼具高效与高准确率。

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics

improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction
image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.
This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction
into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical
research.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine
that reduces manual effort, accelerates innovation cycles, and enhances
decision making in complex R&D environments.

Result: 实验表明降维能保留足够对齐信息，同时显著降低越狱攻击的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 高维表示既是优势也是挑战，降维为安全对齐提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

Conclusion: VLMPlanner通过视觉上下文和动态推理显著提升自动驾驶规划的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

Result: 基于纽约共享单车数据的实验显示，HAG-PS在提高单车可用性等方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAG-PS是一种有效的动态移动资源分配方法，解决了多智能体强化学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

Result: 模型表现差异显著，部分模型在9×9以上迷宫完全失败，冰岛语表现更差。

Conclusion: LLMs的空间推理能力受训练数据和语言影响，需架构创新以实现跨语言可靠导航。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,

challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

Conclusion: GraphDPO有效解决了知识图谱中的不完全遗忘和边界知识弱化问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

Method: 采用树结构Parzen估计器动态调整不同层的剪枝比例和KV缓存量化带宽，结合剪枝与KV缓存量化，并引入无需微调的快速剪枝技术。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5 7B和13B等基准数据集上表现优于SparseGPT和Wanda等现有技术，尤其在KV缓存资源分配上设定了新标准。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了LMMs的内存效率，为边缘设备部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

*Lijian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态知识图谱中模态分布不均衡导致实体表示不鲁棒，现有方法忽略了多模态数据的互补性。

Method: 提出MoCME框架，包含互补性引导的模态知识融合模块和熵引导负采样机制，利用模态内和模态间的互补性增强实体表示。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，MoCME性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCME通过有效利用多模态互补性和动态负采样，显著提升了多模态知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决实际应用中动态环境（如仓库）下多智能体路径规划的需求，包括智能体进出或障碍物移动等情况。

Method: 1) 提出D-MAPF的通用定义；2) 设计多阶段计算框架；3) 开发基于ASP的新方法，结合重规划和修复策略，引入隧道概念。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在计算性能和解决方案质量方面具有优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态环境下的多智能体路径规划提供了有效的解决方案，并展示了其实际应用潜力。

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within
a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles.
Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the
environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of
real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将公平性作为运行时属性的分析框架，基于动态偏见的硬币投掷模型，研究了监控和强制执行公平性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平性研究是静态的，而现实中的AI系统是动态演变的，因此需要研究动态环境下的公平性。

Method: 使用动态偏见的硬币投掷序列模型，分析监控和强制执行公平性的策略。

Result: 总结了适用于不同环境动态、预测范围和置信阈值的监控与强制执行策略。

Conclusion: 动态公平性需要灵活的策略，现有解决方案适用于特定动态或静态环境。

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于启发式深度聚类的方法，用于学习社会共享的价值基础和多组价值系统，以更准确地反映社会的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的价值学习通常将社会价值系统视为个体价值系统的简单聚合，而社会科学和人文学科研究表明，社会价值系统应视为不同群体的价值系统集合。

Method: 采用启发式深度聚类方法，从代理样本中观察基于价值的定性偏好，学习社会共享的价值基础和多样化的价值系统。

Result: 在旅行决策的实际数据用例中验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能更准确地捕捉社会价值系统的多样性，为伦理AI的价值对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

Motivation: 解决自动语音通话项目中受益人流失和参与度低的问题，并验证AI干预是否能实际改善健康行为。

Method: 使用AI模型（多臂老虎机模型）识别最需要干预的受益人，并进行针对性服务呼叫。

Result: AI干预显著提升了听众参与度，并改善了受益人服用补品（如铁、钙）的行为及对关键健康话题的理解。

Conclusion: AI在改善母婴健康方面具有潜力，不仅能提升参与度，还能直接促进健康行为的改变。

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

Motivation: 尽管CoT显著提升了模型推理能力，但其内部机制尚不明确，研究旨在揭示其工作原理。

Method: 通过逆向追踪信息流（解码、投影和激活阶段），定量分析CoT的作用。

Result: CoT可能作为解码空间剪枝工具，利用答案模板引导输出；任务依赖的神经元调控（开放域减少激活，封闭域增加激活）。

Conclusion: 研究提供了新的机制解释框架，为设计高效、鲁棒的CoT提示提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

Motivation: 智能合约注释生成的质量评估存在挑战，传统指标无法捕捉领域特异性，而人工评估成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 开发了evalSmarT框架，结合约40种LLMs和10种提示策略，支持400多种评估配置。

Result: 结果表明提示设计显著影响与人类判断的一致性，LLM评估提供了可扩展且语义丰富的替代方案。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的评估是智能合约注释生成质量评估的有效且可扩展方法。

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

Result: 在DocBench和MMLongBench数据集上达到最先进性能，表现出强大的领域适应性和清晰的推理路径。

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG有效解决了多模态RAG方法的局限性，提升了生成模型的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

Motivation: 在时间或能量受限的POMDP应用中，离线策略更受欢迎，但现有离线算法无法扩展到大规模POMDP。

Method: 提出POMCGS算法，动态折叠搜索树构建策略图，结合动作渐进扩展和观测聚类方法，支持连续POMDP。

Result: POMCGS能处理现有离线算法无法解决的挑战性POMDP，其策略性能与最先进的在线算法相当。

Conclusion: POMCGS为大规模POMDP提供了一种高效的离线解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大型神经语言模型在逻辑推理上的局限性，尤其是无法表示高阶逻辑的问题。

Method: 方法是将神经网络视为逻辑谓词空间上的线性算子，分析每层只能编码一级逻辑推理，从而限制表达能力。

Result: 结果表明，特定深度的神经网络无法表示高阶逻辑（如复杂谓词上的计数），并揭示了嵌入过程中的非平凡零空间。

Conclusion: 结论是这些发现为模型幻觉、重复和有限规划等现象提供了解释，并为未来架构扩展和可解释性策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

Conclusion: 该基准为交互环境中幻觉问题的研究提供了系统化工具和方向。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

Motivation: 基因表达分析复杂且需要专业知识，现有自动化方法在灵活性和精确性上存在不足。

Method: GenoMAS通过六个专业LLM代理的协作，采用类型化消息传递协议和引导规划框架，动态调整任务执行。

Result: 在GenoTEX基准测试中，数据预处理和基因识别的性能分别提升了10.61%和16.85%。

Conclusion: GenoMAS不仅性能优越，还能发现生物学上合理的基因-表型关联，为基因组学研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

Result: 案例研究和定量比较验证了框架在图匹配和大图探索中的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合结构和属性信息，显著提升了图匹配的效果和用户体验。

Abstract: In traditional graph retrieval tools, graph matching is commonly used to
retrieve desired graphs from extensive graph datasets according to their
structural similarities. However, in real applications, graph nodes have
numerous attributes which also contain valuable information for evaluating
similarities between graphs. Thus, to achieve superior graph matching results,
it is crucial for graph retrieval tools to make full use of the attribute
information in addition to structural information. We propose a novel framework
for interactive visual graph matching. In the proposed framework, an
attribute-structure synchronization method is developed for representing
structural and attribute features in a unified embedding space based on
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). To support fast and interactive matching,
\revise{our method} provides users with intuitive visual query interfaces for
traversing, filtering and searching for the target graph in the embedding space
conveniently. With the designed interfaces, the users can also specify a new
target graph with desired structural and semantic features. Besides, evaluation
views are designed for easy validation and interpretation of the matching

Motivation: 现有研究在理解用户意图一致性方面取得进展，但存在重复推荐问题，需解决。

Method: 使用统计分析和实验设计，发现重复与模型及解码策略相关；提出AR-Trip方法，通过添加扰动和三种机制避免重复POI。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，AR-Trip成功减少重复并提高推荐精度。

Conclusion: AR-Trip有效解决了重复推荐问题，同时提升了推荐质量。

Abstract: Trip recommendation has emerged as a highly sought-after service over the
past decade. Although current studies significantly understand human intention
consistency, they struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes that need
resolution. We make two pivotal discoveries using statistical analyses and
experimental designs: (1) The occurrence of repetitions is intricately linked
to the models and decoding strategies. (2) During training and decoding, adding
perturbations to logits can reduce repetition. Motivated by these observations,
we introduce AR-Trip (Anti Repetition for Trip Recommendation), which
incorporates a cycle-aware predictor comprising three mechanisms to avoid
duplicate Points-of-Interest (POIs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in
alleviating repetition. Experiments on four public datasets illustrate that
AR-Trip successfully mitigates repetition issues while enhancing precision.

TL;DR: 通过将LlamaRec框架中的Llama2替换为Llama3，提升了推荐系统的性能，实验结果显示在多个数据集上均有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI领域竞争激烈，大型语言模型（LLM）不断更新，但许多研究未充分利用这些进展。本研究旨在通过模型替换提升推荐系统性能。

Method: 在LlamaRec框架中用Llama3替换Llama2，保持随机种子和输入数据一致以确保公平比较。

Result: 在ML-100K、Beauty和Games数据集上分别实现了38.65%、8.69%和8.19%的平均性能提升。

Conclusion: 模型替换是一种成本效益高的方法，无需系统结构调整即可显著提升推荐质量，适用于当前推荐系统的性能优化。

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

*Thorsten Krause,Harrie Oosterhuis*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LCM4Rec是一种非参数方法，通过学习用户选择模型，更准确地推断用户偏好和选择行为，优于传统假设模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统选择模型基于特定假设，但无法确定这些假设是否准确反映用户行为，或错误假设对推断的影响。

Method: 提出LCM4Rec，利用核密度估计推断用户选择模型，同时学习用户偏好和选择方式。

Result: 实验表明LCM4Rec能准确恢复数据集的选择模型，提供稳健的用户偏好推断，并更抗曝光偏差。

Conclusion: 学习而非假设选择模型能生成更稳健的预测，有助于更好地理解用户选择行为。

Abstract: Choice models predict which items users choose from presented options. In
recommendation settings, they can infer user preferences while countering
exposure bias. In contrast with traditional univariate recommendation models,
choice models consider which competitors appeared with the chosen item. This
ability allows them to distinguish whether a user chose an item due to
preference, i.e., they liked it; or competition, i.e., it was the best
available option. Each choice model assumes specific user behavior, e.g., the
multinomial logit model. However, it is currently unclear how accurately these
assumptions capture actual user behavior, how wrong assumptions impact
inference, and whether better models exist.
  In this work, we propose the learned choice model for recommendation
(LCM4Rec), a non-parametric method for estimating the choice model. By applying
kernel density estimation, LCM4Rec infers the most likely error distribution
that describes the effect of inter-item cannibalization and thereby
characterizes the users' choice model. Thus, it simultaneously infers what
users prefer and how they make choices. Our experimental results indicate that
our method (i) can accurately recover the choice model underlying a dataset;
(ii) provides robust user preference inference, in contrast with existing
choice models that are only effective when their assumptions match user
behavior; and (iii) is more resistant against exposure bias than existing
choice models. Thereby, we show that learning choice models, instead of
assuming them, can produce more robust predictions. We believe this work
provides an important step towards better understanding users' choice behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的会话推荐方法主要关注ID序列信息，忽略了丰富的语义信息，限制了模型推断用户真实意图的能力。

Method: 利用预训练的GNN模型选择候选物品集，结合LLM推断多语义意图，并通过对齐机制整合语义与结构意图。

Result: 在Beauty和ML-1M数据集上的实验表明，该方法能显著提升GNN框架的推荐性能。

Conclusion: LLM-DMsRec通过整合语义与结构意图，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了会话推荐的准确性。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) is mainly based on anonymous user
interaction sequences to recommend the items that the next user is most likely
to click. Currently, the most popular and high-performing SBR methods primarily
leverage graph neural networks (GNNs), which model session sequences as
graph-structured data to effectively capture user intent. However, most
GNNs-based SBR methods primarily focus on modeling the ID sequence information
of session sequences, while neglecting the rich semantic information embedded
within them. This limitation significantly hampers model's ability to
accurately infer users' true intention. To address above challenge, this paper
proposes a novel SBR approach called Integrating LLM-Derived Multi-Semantic
Intent into Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (LLM-DMsRec). The
method utilizes a pre-trained GNN model to select the top-k items as candidate
item sets and designs prompts along with a large language model (LLM) to infer
multi-semantic intents from these candidate items. Specifically, we propose an
alignment mechanism that effectively integrates the semantic intent inferred by
the LLM with the structural intent captured by GNNs. Extensive experiments
conducted on the Beauty and ML-1M datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
can be seamlessly integrated into GNNs framework, significantly enhancing its
recommendation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过在线反馈优化广告文本生成的方法，显著提升点击率（CTR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的广告文本在点击率上不一定优于人工创作，需填补生成质量与在线性能之间的差距。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）通过检索增强生成（RAG）和链式推理（CoT）进行多样化文本采样；2）基于CTR增益和置信度进行偏好优化。

Result: 在离线和在线实验中均表现优异，尤其在大规模电商平台上显著提升了CTR。

Conclusion: 该方法能端到端生成高CTR广告文本，具有强适用性和有效性。

Abstract: Advertising text plays a critical role in determining click-through rates
(CTR) in online advertising. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant
efficiency advantages over manual ad text creation. However, LLM-generated ad
texts do not guarantee higher CTR performance compared to human-crafted texts,
revealing a gap between generation quality and online performance of ad texts.
In this work, we propose a novel ad text generation method which optimizes for
CTR through preference optimization from online feedback. Our approach adopts
an innovative two-stage framework: (1) diverse ad text sampling via one-shot
in-context learning, using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide
exemplars with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning; (2) CTR-driven preference
optimization from online feedback, which weighs preference pairs according to
their CTR gains and confidence levels. Through our method, the resulting model
enables end-to-end generation of high-CTR ad texts. Extensive experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online
metrics. Notably, we have applied our method on a large-scale online shopping
platform and achieved significant CTR improvements, showcasing its strong
applicability and effectiveness in advertising systems.

Motivation: Decision Transformer在推荐任务中面临轨迹缝合困难和状态表示高维度的挑战，影响了其性能和效率。

Result: 在公共数据集和在线推荐系统上的实验表明，TADT-CSA模型优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TADT-CSA模型通过改进信号和状态表示，显著提升了推荐系统的准确性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs),
generative recommendation has shown great potential in enhancing both the
accuracy and semantic understanding of modern recommender systems. Compared to
LLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied
to sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory
stitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high
dimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in
recommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and
struggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State
Abstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional
Return-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that
encourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential
trend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into
the DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations.
Within this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization
(TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to
incorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction
network and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to
ensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current
state and the transition information between adjacent states. Empirical results
on both public datasets and an online recommendation system demonstrate the
effectiveness of the TADT-CSA model and its superiority over baseline methods.

Motivation: 在快速发展和跨学科的研究环境中，传统基于合著和引用的方法难以有效推荐潜在合作者。

Result: 克隆网络结构能生成更有意义的社区，并发现更广泛的合作机会。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了跨学科研究者推荐的准确性和覆盖范围。

Abstract: Finding potential research collaborators is a challenging task, especially in
today's fast-growing and interdisciplinary research landscape. While
traditional methods often rely on observable relationships such as
co-authorships and citations to construct the research network, in this work,
we focus solely on publication content to build a topic-based research network
using BERTopic with a fine-tuned SciBERT model that connects and recommends
researchers across disciplines based on shared topical interests. A major
challenge we address is publication imbalance, where some researchers publish
much more than others, often across several topics. Without careful handling,
their less frequent interests are hidden under dominant topics, limiting the
network's ability to detect their full research scope. To tackle this, we
introduce a cloning strategy that clusters a researcher's publications and
treats each cluster as a separate node. This allows researchers to be part of
multiple communities, improving the detection of interdisciplinary links.
Evaluation on the proposed method shows that the cloned network structure leads
to more meaningful communities and uncovers a broader set of collaboration
opportunities.

TL;DR: NodeDiffRec是一种无需外部知识的推荐系统增强框架，通过扩散技术实现细粒度节点级图生成，显著提升语义多样性和结构连通性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统依赖外部资源（如知识图谱或大语言模型），限制了实际应用；而无需知识的模型因缺乏增强原语而表现不足。

Method: 提出NodeDiffRec，通过扩散技术生成伪物品及交互，并通过去噪偏好建模过程优化用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集和推荐算法上实现SOTA性能，Recall@5和NDCG@5最大提升分别达98.6%和84.0%。

Conclusion: NodeDiffRec无需外部知识即可显著提升推荐系统的语义和结构表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as
knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which
limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and
computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster
recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation
primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps
as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works
that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a
pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained
node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of
restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items
and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for
injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference
modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and
structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the
superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with
maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5
over selected baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMTS的商业潜力和资源密集型开发引发了对知识产权保护的担忧，同时其强大的预测能力可能被滥用于生成虚假时间序列数据。

Method: Waltz利用时间序列补丁嵌入与特定LLM标记（冷标记）之间的相似性统计，通过重连相似性嵌入水印，并使用相似性z分数检测水印。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验表明，Waltz在保持生成时间序列质量的同时，实现了高水印检测准确率。

Conclusion: Waltz是一种兼容现有LLMTS模型的有效水印解决方案，能够平衡知识产权保护和数据质量。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Time Series Forecasting (LLMTS) has shown
remarkable promise in handling complex and diverse temporal data, representing
a significant step toward foundation models for time series analysis. However,
this emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the
substantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise
urgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their
powerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce
misleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,
we explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding
imperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain
detectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking
framework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz
is inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are
rarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold
tokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the
similarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and
detects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side
effects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification
strategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise
within a defined boundary. Extensive experiments using two popular LLMTS models
across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that Waltz achieves high watermark
detection accuracy with minimal impact on the quality of the generated time
series.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.

Motivation: 研究Polar编码的线性解码方法，以在小损失或少量比特翻转的情况下实现高效解码。

Result: 展示了数值示例，并提供了Mathematica代码供用户直接尝试。

Conclusion: 线性解码方法为Polar编码提供了一种高效的替代方案，尤其适用于特定场景。

Abstract: Polar encoding, described by Arikan in IEEE Transactions on Information
Theory, Vol. 55, No. 7, July 2009, was a milestone for telecommunications. A
Polar code distributes information among high and low-capacity channels,
showing the possibility of achieving perfect channel capacity. The
high-capacity channels allow almost noiseless transmission of data. When these
channels are not high noise, reliability is achieved in the signal
transmission. It starts to compete against codes such a Low-Density
Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. Polar code can be also considered error correcting,
based on the redundancy inherent in its structure. This feature makes polar
encoding also applicable to digital quantum-resistant cryptography protocols.
This work explores linear decoding at a first or single trial in the case of
small losses or small number of bit-flipping, and repeated transmission for
medium level losses. This is distinct from Arikans successive probabilistic
decoding by application of probabilistic rules. Linear decoding is done
directly from solving the linear equations connecting the codewords x and the
received signals y after transmission via noisy channels. Numerical examples
will be shown. Along with this work, programming in Mathematica language was
used. Codes are available for copy-and-paste for Mathematica users to
immediately try the described formalism.

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在简单源和Ahlswede反例中表现出优于现有方法的效率。

Conclusion: 所提算法显著降低了计算复杂度，并保证了全局收敛性。

Abstract: The error exponent in lossy source coding characterizes the asymptotic decay
rate of error probability with respect to blocklength. The Marton's error
exponent provides the theoretically optimal bound on this rate. However,
computation methods of the Marton's error exponent remain underdeveloped due to
its formulation as a non-convex optimization problem with limited efficient
solvers. While a recent grid search algorithm can compute its inverse function,
it incurs prohibitive computational costs from two-dimensional brute-force
parameter grid searches. This paper proposes a composite maximization approach
that effectively handles both Marton's error exponent and its inverse function.
Through a constraint decoupling technique, the resulting problem formulations
admit efficient solvers driven by an alternating maximization algorithm. By
fixing one parameter via a one-dimensional line search, the remaining
subproblem becomes convex and can be efficiently solved by alternating variable
updates, thereby significantly reducing search complexity. Therefore, the
global convergence of the algorithm can be guaranteed. Numerical experiments
for simple sources and the Ahlswede's counterexample, demonstrates the superior
efficiency of our algorithm in contrast to existing methods.

Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is a technique designed to extract
meaningful information related to one random variable from another random

this paper, neural network based estimation of the IB problem solution is
studied, through the lens of a novel formulation of the IB problem. Via
exploiting the inherent structure of the IB functional and leveraging the
mapping approach, the proposed formulation of the IB problem involves only a
single variable to be optimized, and subsequently is readily amenable to
data-driven estimators based on neural networks. A theoretical analysis is
conducted to guarantee that the neural estimator asymptotically solves the IB
problem, and the numerical experiments on both synthetic and MNIST datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the neural estimator.

Abstract: We consider the computation of the entanglement-assisted quantum
rate-distortion function, which plays a central role in quantum information
theory. We propose an efficient alternating minimization algorithm based on the
Lagrangian analysis. Instead of fixing the multiplier corresponding to the
distortion constraint, we update the multiplier in each iteration. Hence the
algorithm solves the original problem itself, rather than the Lagrangian

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应加权置信传播（WBP）解码器，通过动态调整权重显著提升解码性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态WBP解码器在解码线性分组码时性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出两种自适应WBP解码器：并行WBP解码器和两阶段解码器，分别通过离散权重搜索和神经网络动态调整权重。

Result: 自适应WBP在多种信道和应用中显著降低误码率，且解码复杂度与静态WBP相当。

Conclusion: 自适应WBP是一种高效且性能优越的解码方法，适用于多种编码场景。

Abstract: Weighted belief propagation (WBP) for the decoding of linear block codes is
considered. In WBP, the Tanner graph of the code is unrolled with respect to
the iterations of the belief propagation decoder. Then, weights are assigned to
the edges of the resulting recurrent network and optimized offline using a
training dataset. The main contribution of this paper is an adaptive WBP where
the weights of the decoder are determined for each received word. Two variants
of this decoder are investigated. In the parallel WBP decoders, the weights
take values in a discrete set. A number of WBP decoders are run in parallel to
search for the best sequence of weights in real time. In the two-stage decoder,
a small neural network is used to dynamically determine the weights of the WBP
decoder for each received word. The proposed adaptive decoders demonstrate
significant improvements over the static counterparts in two applications. In
the first application, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, polar and quasi-cyclic
low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes are used over an additive white
Gaussian noise channel. The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit
error rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static
WBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and
the signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code
designed for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code
is a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this
case, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is
decoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The
results show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to
the neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational
complexity and decoding latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着5G向6G的演进，URLLC面临更严格的性能要求，传统极化码因解码延迟高而受限，大规模MIMO系统因其丰富的空间自由度成为解决这一挑战的关键技术。

Method: 提出了一种时空二维极化编码方案，结合MMSE接收机，利用高斯近似方法分析二维极化行为，并在有限码长和大空间自由度下证明其容量可达性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统时域极化码相比，该方案能显著降低延迟并保证可靠性，或在相同延迟约束下提高可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方案为未来6G URLLC场景中的大规模MIMO系统提供了一种容量可达且低延迟的信道编码解决方案。

Abstract: With the evolution from 5G to 6G, ultra-reliable low-latency communication
(URLLC) faces increasingly stringent performance requirements. Lower latency
constraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade
decoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system
is considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its
abundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically
capacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical
applicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal
two-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing
minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly
applied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large
spatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the
spatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within
this framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization
behavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving
property of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints
and large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to
traditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly
reduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve
reliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving
and latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in
future 6G URLLC scenarios.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) dynamically control signal
propagation to enhance wireless communications. This paper presents a novel
framework for rotatable RIS assisted physical-layer multicast systems, aiming
to maximize the sum of minimum multicast rates via joint optimization of base
station beamforming, RIS phase shifts, and orientation. Unlike unicast or
non-rotatable setups, the rotatable RIS adapts orientation to align signals
with user groups, improving fairness and rates for weak users. An alternating
optimization approach combines convex optimization for beamforming/phase shifts
with exhaustive search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for orientation.
Majorization-Minimization-based algorithms solve subproblems iteratively.
Simulation results show the framework achieves 24.1% rate improvement via
exhaustive search and 20.0% via PSO over the non-rotatable RIS baseline, with
PSO performance close to the exhaustive search upper bound, highlighting the
benefits of physical-layer multicast and orientation optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如内点法）在计算LM率时复杂度高，尤其在大输入字母表下不实用，因此需要更高效的计算方法。

Result: 数值实验验证了算法的可行性和高效性，且收敛性分析表明算法具有次线性收敛速率。

Conclusion: 该方法为LM率的高效计算提供了实用解决方案，尤其适用于高维场景。

Abstract: The mismatch capacity characterizes the highest information rate of the
channel under a prescribed decoding metric and serves as a critical performance
indicator in numerous practical communication scenarios. Compared to the
commonly used Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), the Lower bound on the
Mismatch capacity (LM rate) generally provides a tighter lower bound on the
mismatch capacity. However, the efficient computation of the LM rate is
significantly more challenging than that of the GMI, particularly as the size
of the channel input alphabet increases. This growth in complexity renders
standard numerical methods (e.g., interior point methods) computationally
intensive and, in some cases, impractical. In this work, we reformulate the
computation of the LM rate as a special instance of the optimal transport (OT)
problem with an additional constraint. Building on this formulation, we develop
a novel numerical algorithm based on the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is well
known for its efficiency in solving entropy regularized optimization problems.
We further provide the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm,
revealing that the algorithm has a sub-linear convergence rate. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed
algorithm for the computation of the LM rate.

Conclusion: SPARCs为安全密钥生成提供了可行的低复杂度替代方案，并为协议设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Secret key agreement from correlated physical layer observations is a
cornerstone of information-theoretic security. This paper proposes and
rigorously analyzes a complete, constructive protocol for secret key agreement
from Gaussian sources using Sparse Regression Codes (SPARCs). Our protocol
systematically leverages the known optimality of SPARCs for both
rate-distortion and Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding, facilitated by their inherent nested
structure. The primary contribution of this work is a comprehensive end-to-end
analysis demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves near-optimal secret
key rates with strong secrecy guarantees, as quantified by a vanishing
variational distance. We explicitly characterize the gap to the optimal rate,
revealing a fundamental trade-off between the key rate and the required public
communication overhead, which is governed by a tunable quantization parameter.
Furthermore, we uncover a non-trivial constrained optimization for this
parameter, showing that practical constraints on the SPARC code parameters
induce a peak in the achievable secret key rate. This work establishes SPARCs
as a viable and theoretically sound framework for secure key generation,
providing a compelling low-complexity alternative to existing schemes and
offering new insights into the practical design of such protocols.

Conclusion: 该模型为大规模LEO星座通信提供了有效的信道建模方法，适用于实际卫星通信系统的设计与分析。

Abstract: A general satellite channel model is proposed for communications between a
rapidly moving low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite in a mega-constellation and a
stationary user on Earth. The channel uses a non-homogeneous binomial point
process (NBPP) for modelling the satellite positions, marked with an
ascending/descending binary random variable for modelling the satellite
directions. Using the marked NBPP, we derive the probability distributions of
power gain, propagation delay, and Doppler shift, resulting in a stochastic
signal propagation model for the mega-constellation geometry in isolation of
other effects. This forms the basis for our proposed channel model as a
randomly time-varying channel. The scattering function of this channel is
derived to characterise how the received power is spread in the delay-Doppler
domain. Global channel parameters such as path loss and channel spread are
analysed in terms of the scattering function. The channel statistics and the
global channel parameters closely match realistic orbit simulations of the
Starlink constellation.

numerical examples, showing that the proposed technique can be used to
characterize the performance of non-adaptive group testing schemes based on
sparse pooling graphs.

Abstract: Inter-user interference remains a critical bottleneck in wireless
communication systems, particularly in the emerging paradigm of semantic
communication (SemCom). Compared to traditional systems, inter-user
interference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often
causing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To
address this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal
Model Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality
rooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to
distinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the
need for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation
lies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions
of JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like
noise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is
treated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models
(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single
universal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as
implicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios
involving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic
similarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit
redundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art
multi-user SemCom frameworks, achieving superior semantic fidelity, robustness
to interference, and scalability-all without requiring additional training
overhead.

Abstract: Wireless communication can be simply subjected to malicious attacks due to
its open nature and shared medium. Detecting jamming attacks is the first and
necessary step to adopt the anti-jamming strategies. This paper presents novel
cooperative jamming detection methods that use the low-rank structure of the
received signal matrix. We employed the likelihood ratio test to propose
detectors for various scenarios. We regarded several scenarios with different
numbers of friendly and jamming nodes and different levels of available
statistical information on noise. We also provided an analytical examination of
the false alarm performance of one of the proposed detectors, which can be used
to adjust the detection threshold. We discussed the synthetic signal generation
and the Monte Carlo (MC)-based threshold setting method, where knowledge of the
distribution of the jamming-free signal, as well as several parameters such as
noise variance and channel state information (CSI), is required to accurately
generate synthetic signals for threshold estimation. Extensive simulations
reveal that the proposed detectors outperform several existing methods,
offering robust and accurate jamming detection in a collaborative network of
sensing nodes.

Conclusion: GTRS码为非GRS的MDS码提供了新的研究方向，扩展了MDS码的理论和应用范围。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are considered optimal because the
minimum distance cannot be improved for a given length and code size. The most
prominent MDS codes are likely the generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. In
1989, Roth and Lempel constructed a type of MDS code that is not a GRS code
(referred to as non-GRS). In 2017, Beelen et al. introduced twisted
Reed-Solomon (TRS) codes and demonstrated that many MDS TRS codes are indeed
non-GRS. Following this, the definition of TRS codes was generalized to the
most comprehensive form, which we refer to as generalized twisted Reed-Solomon
(GTRS) codes. In this paper, we prove that two families of GTRS codes are
non-GRS and provide a systematic generator matrix for a class of GTRS codes.
Inspired by the form of the systematic generator matrix for GTRS codes,we also
present a construction of non-GRS MDS codes.

defined over a small finite field, providing closed formulas for the expected

Abstract: DNA data storage systems encode digital data into DNA strands, enabling dense
and durable storage. Efficient data retrieval depends on coverage depth, a key
performance metric. We study the random access coverage depth problem and focus
on minimizing the expected number of reads needed to recover information
strands encoded via a linear code. We compute the asymptotic performance of a
recently proposed code construction, establishing and refining a conjecture in
the field by giving two independent proofs. We also analyze a geometric code
construction based on balanced quasi-arcs and optimize its parameters. Finally,
we investigate the full distribution of the random variables that arise in the
coverage depth problem, of which the traditionally studied expectation is just
the first moment. This allows us to distinguish between code constructions
that, at first glance, may appear to behave identically.

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.
