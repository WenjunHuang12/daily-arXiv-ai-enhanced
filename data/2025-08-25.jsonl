The vehicular\nvisible light communication (VVLC) system is a key feature in leveraging\nexisting infrastructures, but it still has several critical challenges.\nEspecially, VVLC channels are highly correlated due to the small gap between\nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) in each headlight, making it difficult to increase\ndata rates by spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we exploit recently\nsynthesized gold nanoparticles (GNPs) to reduce the correlation between LEDs,\ni.e., the chiroptical properties of GNPs for differential absorption depending\non the azimuth angle of incident light are used to mitigate the LED\ncorrelation. In addition, we adopt a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio\n(SLNR)-based precoder to support multiple users. The ratio of RGB light sources\nin each LED also needs to be optimized to maximize the sum SLNR satisfying a\nwhite light constraint for illumination since the GNPs can vary the color of\ntransmitted light by the differential absorption across wavelength. The\nnonconvex optimization problems for precoders and RGB ratios can be solved by\nthe generalized Rayleigh quotient with the approximated shot noise and\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results show that the\nSLNR-based precoder with the optimized RGB ratios significantly improves the\nsum rate in a multi-user vehicular environment and the secrecy rate in a\nwiretapping scenario.

Our model is\ninspired by recent work on FPT algorithms for MinCSP where frequently both\nupper and lower bounds on the parameterized complexity of a problem correspond\nto $k$-variable udCSPs; e.g., the FPT algorithms for Boolean MinCSP (Kim et\nal., SODA 2023) and Directed Multicut with three cut requests (Hatzel et al.,\nSODA 2023) both reduce to k-variable udCSPs, and the canonical W[1]-hardness\nconstruction in the area, Paired Min Cut by Marx and Razgon (IPL 2009), is\neffectively a k-variable udCSP.\n  The udCSP framework represents constraints with unbounded domains via a\ncollection $\\mathcal{M}$ of unary maps into a finite-domain base language\n$\\Gamma$. We develop an algebraic theory for studying the complexity of\nudCSP$(\\Gamma,\\mathcal{M})$ with a Galois connection based on partial\nmultifunctions.\n  We study three types of maps: unrestricted, one-hot, and monotone. For\nunrestricted maps, the problem is W[1]-hard for all but trivial cases, and for\none-hot maps, the characterization coincides with Marx' FPT dichotomy for\nBoolean Weighted CSPs (Computational Complexity 2005). For the case of monotone\nmaps Mo, we show that the complexity depends on restricted identifies we call\nordered polymorphisms; we identify the \"connector\" polymorphism as the likely\nFPT boundary. We show that its absence implies that udCSP($\\Gamma$,Mo) defines\nall permutations, and the problem is W[1]-hard; while its presence for a binary\nlanguage implies bounded twin-width, and the problem is FPT (Twin-Width IV;\nBonnet et al., JACM 2024). For non-binary languages, where twin-width does not\napply, the polymorphism coincides with a notion of bounded projected grid-rank;\nhowever, we leave the FPT question for this case open."}

While many methods assume overlapping users or\nitems to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.\nThus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are\nneeded.\n  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of\noverlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional\ndiscrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders\nrepresent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their\nfine-grained, multi-faceted nature.\n  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a\nframework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared\nPreprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users\nand items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user\npreferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain\nRating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across\ndomains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.\n  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates\ndomain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the\nnon-overlapping CDR setting."}

With the astounding\nadvances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been\ndeveloped to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the\npotential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently\nconstrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs\ntypically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input\nlayer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in\ndeeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual\nembeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer\nSteerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to\ndirectly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the\nprogressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF\nleverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically\nrich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across\nLLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors.

When\nrunning such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the\nalgorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems\naddressing this, which we call \"Quality Control Problems.\" These problems are\nspecified by a (positive, real-valued) \"quality function\" $\\rho$ and a\ndistribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is\n\"high quality,\" meaning its $\\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept\ninputs $x \\sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$\nwith $\\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker\nthan either component problem: testing for \"$\\rho(x) \\approx 1$\" or testing if\n$x \\sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.\n  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control\nproblem, where $D \\in \\Delta(\\{0,1\\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D\n,\\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time.

It encompasses both basic reasoning\ntasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental\nreasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.\nBuilding upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first\nophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning\ntraces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning\ntasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic\nThinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and\ndynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage\nmechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,\noutperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and\nophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\\%, 15.00\\%, 21.20\\%, and 17.66\\%.

Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local\nneighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as\npairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches\ncan mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of\nmanifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the\ncompactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to\nseparate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this\nresearch, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with\nTwo-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by\neffectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by\ndividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,\nit constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second\nphase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional\ncharacteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms\nwidely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure\npreservation, with a slight loss in local structure.

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

By strategically leveraging prior\ninformation and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the\nPareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.\nThrough two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we\ndemonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,\nand scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively\nprioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto\nfrontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in\nscenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient\nperformance."}

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,\nthese systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the\nability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this\nskill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply\nsimulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.

The framework initially generates the complete set of\ndecision trees that meet performance requirements, then leverages large\nlanguage models to evaluate these trees for developer comprehensibility,\nultimately selecting solutions that best facilitate human understanding and\nenhancement. Experimental results demonstrate that \\texttt{ComTree}\nsignificantly improves comprehensibility while maintaining competitive\nperformance, showing potential for further advancement. The source code is\navailable at https://github.com/thu-media/ComTree."}

When\nrunning such an algorithm on an arbitrary input, we must ask: Can we trust the\nalgorithm on this input? We identify a new class of algorithmic problems\naddressing this, which we call \"Quality Control Problems.\" These problems are\nspecified by a (positive, real-valued) \"quality function\" $\\rho$ and a\ndistribution $D$ such that, with high probability, a sample drawn from $D$ is\n\"high quality,\" meaning its $\\rho$-value is near $1$. The goal is to accept\ninputs $x \\sim D$ and reject potentially adversarially generated inputs $x$\nwith $\\rho(x)$ far from $1$. The objective of quality control is thus weaker\nthan either component problem: testing for \"$\\rho(x) \\approx 1$\" or testing if\n$x \\sim D$, and offers the possibility of more efficient algorithms.\n  In this work, we consider the sublinear version of the quality control\nproblem, where $D \\in \\Delta(\\{0,1\\}^N)$ and the goal is to solve the $(D\n,\\rho)$-quality problem with $o(N)$ queries and time. As a case study, we\nconsider random graphs, i.e., $D = G_{n,p}$ (and $N = \\binom{n}2$), and the\n$k$-clique count function $\\rho_k := C_k(G)/\\mathbb{E}_{G' \\sim\nG_{n,p}}[C_k(G')]$, where $C_k(G)$ is the number of $k$-cliques in $G$. Testing\nif $G \\sim G_{n,p}$ with one sample, let alone with sublinear query access to\nthe sample, is of course impossible. Testing if $\\rho_k(G)\\approx 1$ requires\n$p^{-\\Omega(k^2)}$ samples. In contrast, we show that the quality control\nproblem for $G_{n,p}$ (with $n \\geq p^{-ck}$ for some constant $c$) with\nrespect to $\\rho_k$ can be tested with $p^{-O(k)}$ queries and time, showing\nquality control is provably superpolynomially more efficient in this setting.\nMore generally, for a motif $H$ of maximum degree $\\Delta(H)$, the respective\nquality control problem can be solved with $p^{-O(\\Delta(H))}$ queries and\nrunning time."}
