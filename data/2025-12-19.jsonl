In the event-level setting, we show the first polynomial lower bounds on the additive error for insertions-only graph problems such as maximum matching, degree histogram and $k$-core. This is an exponential improvement on the polylogarithmic lower bounds of Fichtenberger et al.[ESA 2021] for the former two problems, and are the first continual release lower bounds for the latter. Our results run counter to the intuition that the difference between insertions-only vs fully dynamic updates causes the gap between polylogarithmic and polynomial additive error. We show that for maximum matching and $k$-core, allowing small multiplicative approximations is what brings the additive error down to polylogarithmic.\n  Beyond graph problems, our techniques also show that polynomial additive error is unavoidable for Simultaneous Norm Estimation in the insertions-only setting. When multiplicative approximations are allowed, we circumvent this lower bound by giving the first continual mechanism with polylogarithmic additive error under $(1+ζ)$ multiplicative approximations, for $ζ>0$, for estimating all monotone symmetric norms simultaneously.\n  In the item-level setting, we show polynomial lower bounds on the product of the multiplicative and the additive error of continual mechanisms for a large range of graph problems. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first lower bounds for any differentially private continual release mechanism with multiplicative error. To obtain this, we prove a new lower bound on the product of multiplicative and additive error for 1-Way-Marginals, from which we reduce to continual graph problems. This generalizes the lower bounds of Hardt and Talwar[STOC 2010] and Bun et al.[STOC 2014] on the additive error for mechanisms with no multiplicative error."}

Based on this thesis we published arXiv:2512.14409", "summary": "Democracy relies on making collective decisions through voting. In addition, voting procedures have further applications, for example in the training of artificial intelligence. An essential criterion for determining the winner of a fair election is that all alternatives are treated equally: this is called neutrality. The established Ranked Pairs voting method cannot simultaneously guarantee neutrality and be computationally tractable for election with ties. River, the recently introduced voting method, shares desirable properties with Ranked Pairs and has further advantages, such as a new property related to resistance against manipulation. Both Ranked Pairs and River use a weighted margin graph to model the election. Ties in the election can lead to edges of equal margin. To order the edges in such a case, a tiebreaking scheme must be employed. Many tiebreaks violate neutrality or other important properties. A tiebreaking scheme that preserves neutrality is Parallel Universe Tiebreaking (PUT). Ranked Pairs with PUT is NP-hard to compute.\n  The main result of this thesis shows that River with PUT can be computed in polynomial worst-case runtime: We can check whether an alternative is a River PUT winner, by running River with a specially constructed ordering of the edges. To construct this ordering, we introduce the semi-River diagram which contains the edges that can appear in any River diagram for some arbitrary tiebreak. On this diagram we can compute the River winners, by applying a variant of Prims algorithm per alternative. Additionally, we give an algorithm improve the previous naive runtime of River from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2 \\log n)$, where n is the number of alternatives."}

To address this issue, we propose a Tri-Dynamic Preprocessing framework for UGC. Firstly, we employ an adaptive factor to regulate preprocessing intensity.

We propose a framework for algorithmic monetary policies that navigates this tradeoff in repeated participation games. Agents, characterized by type (capability) and stake, choose to participate or abstain at each round; the policy (probabilistically) selects high-type agents for task execution (maximizing throughput) while distributing rewards to sustain decentralization. We analyze equilibria under two agent behaviors: myopic (short-term utility maximization) and foresighted (multi-round planning). For myopic agents, performance-centric policies risk centralization, but foresight enables stable decentralization with some volatility to the token value. We further discuss virtual stake--a hybrid of type and stake--as an alternative approach. We show that the initial virtual stake distribution critically impacts long-term outcomes, suggesting that policies must indirectly manage decentralization."}

Existing works mainly focus on recommending a set of items, but online e-commerce platforms have recently begun to pay attention to exploring users' potential interests at the category level. Category-level recommendation allows e-commerce platforms to promote users' engagements by expanding their interests to different types of items. In addition, it complements item-level recommendations when the latter becomes extremely challenging for users with little-known information and past interactions. Furthermore, it facilitates item-level recommendations in existing works. The predicted category, which is called intention in those works, aids the exploration of item-level preference. However, such category-level preference prediction has mostly been accomplished through applying item-level models. Some key differences between item-level recommendations and category-level recommendations are ignored in such a simplistic adaptation. In this paper, we propose a cascading category recommender (CCRec) model with a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode item-level information to perform category-level recommendations. Experiments show the advantages of this model over methods designed for item-level recommendations."}

Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $α$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\\Pr_{D}[E] \\ge 1-α$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can approximate any convex set. This problem has been studied in many different communities. In statistics, this is the classic minimum volume estimator introduced by Rousseeuw as a robust non-parametric estimator of location and scatter. However in high dimensions, it becomes NP-hard to obtain any non-trivial approximation factor in volume when the condition number $β$ of the ellipsoid (ratio of the largest to the smallest axis length) goes to $\\infty$. This motivates the focus of our paper: can we efficiently find confidence ellipsoids with volume approximation guarantees when compared to ellipsoids of bounded condition number $β$?\n  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that finds an ellipsoid $E$ whose volume is within a $O(β^{γd})$ multiplicative factor of the volume of best $β$-conditioned ellipsoid while covering at least $1-O(α/γ)$ probability mass for any $γ< α$. We complement this with a computational hardness result that shows that such a dependence seems necessary up to constants in the exponent. The algorithm and analysis uses the rich primal-dual structure of the minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid and the geometric Brascamp-Lieb inequality. As a consequence, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with approximation guarantees on worst-case instances of the robust subspace recovery problem."}

The BIG-MAP Archive is a cloud-based, disciplinary, private repository designed to address these challenges.

Access can be restricted to members of specific communities or open to the entire consortium, such as the BATTERY 2030+, a consortium accelerating advanced battery technologies. Uploaded data and metadata are controlled via fine grained permissions, allowing access to individual project members or the full initiative. The formalized upload process ensures data are formatted and ready for publication in open repositories when needed. This paper reviews the repository's key features, showing how the BIG-MAP Archive enables secure, controlled data sharing within large consortia.

In our setting, buyers arrive sequentially demanding a set of items, each with a value drawn from a known distribution. We study environments where buyers' valuations exhibit complementarities. In such settings, standard item-pricing mechanisms fail to leverage item multiplicities, while existing static bundle-pricing mechanisms rely on problem-specific arguments that do not generalize.\n  We develop a unified technique for online resource allocation with complementarities for three domains: (i) single-minded combinatorial auctions with maximum bundle size $d$, (ii) general single-minded combinatorial auctions, and (iii) a graph-based routing model in which buyers request to route a unit of flow from a source node $s$ to a target node $t$ in a capacitated graph. Our approach yields static and anonymous bundle-pricing mechanisms whose performance improves exponentially with item capacities. For the $d$-single-minded setting with minimum item capacity $B$, we obtain an $O(d^{1/B})$-competitive mechanism, recovering the known $O(d)$ bound for unit capacities ($B=1$) and achieving exponentially better guarantees as capacities grow. For general single-minded combinatorial auctions and the graph-routing model, we obtain $O(m^{1/(B+1)})$-competitive mechanisms, where $m$ is the number of items.\n  We complement these results with information-theoretic lower bounds. We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than $Ω((m/\\ln m)^{1/(B+2)})$ in the general single-minded setting and $Ω((d/\\ln d)^{1/(B+1)})$ in the $d$-single-minded setting. In doing so, we reveal a deep connection to the extremal combinatorics problem of determining the maximum number of qualitatively independent partitions of a ground set."}

Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users.

These methods tend to be computationally expensive, sensitive to traffic measurement errors, and often produce opaque inferences. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic, lightweight, and explainable alternative to behavioral fingerprinting focusing on the network services (e.g., TCP/80, UDP/53) that IoT devices use to perform their intended functions over extended periods. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We demonstrate that IoT devices exhibit stable and distinguishable patterns in their use of network services over a period of time. We formalize the notion of service-level fingerprints and derive a generalized method to represent network behaviors using a configurable granularity parameter. (2) We develop a procedure to extract service-level fingerprints, apply it to traffic from 13 consumer IoT device types in a lab testbed, and evaluate the resulting representations in terms of their convergence and recurrence properties.

Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist."}

We define Origin (O), Destination (D), and Time (T ) patterns (ODT patterns) and propose a bottom-up algorithm that enumerates them. We suggest and employ optimizations that greatly reduce the search space and the computational cost of pattern enumeration. We also propose pattern variants (constrained patterns and top-k patterns) that could be useful to differ- ent applications scenarios. Finally, we propose an approximate solution that fast identifies ODT patterns of specific sizes, following a generate-and-test approach. We evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods on three real datasets and showcase interesting ODT flow patterns in them."}

Existing methods typically construct sparser views by randomly perturbing the original interaction graph, as they have no idea about the authentic user preferences. Owing to the sparse nature of recommendation data, this paradigm can only capture insufficient semantic information. To address the issue, we propose InfoDCL, a novel diffusion-based contrastive learning framework for recommendation. Rather than injecting randomly sampled Gaussian noise, we employ a single-step diffusion process that integrates noise with auxiliary semantic information to generate signals and feed them to the standard diffusion process to generate authentic user preferences as contrastive views. Besides, based on a comprehensive analysis of the mutual influence between generation and preference learning in InfoDCL, we build a collaborative training objective strategy to transform the interference between them into mutual collaboration. Additionally, we employ multiple GCN layers only during inference stage to incorporate higher-order co-occurrence information while maintaining training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that InfoDCL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our InfoDCL offers an effective solution for enhancing recommendation performance and suggests a novel paradigm for applying diffusion method in contrastive learning frameworks."}

While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR."}

While sampling from explicit lists is well-understood, modern applications -- such as machine learning over relational data -- often require sampling from a set defined implicitly by a relational join. In this paper, we study the problem of \\emph{subset sampling over joins}: drawing a random subset from the join results, where each join result is included independently with some probability. We address the general setting where the probability is derived from input tuple weights via decomposable functions (e.g., product, sum, min, max). Since the join size can be exponentially larger than the input, the naive approach of materializing all join results to perform subset sampling is computationally infeasible. We propose the first efficient algorithms for subset sampling over acyclic joins: (1) a \\emph{static index} for generating multiple (independent) subset samples over joins; (2) a \\emph{one-shot} algorithm for generating a single subset sample over joins; (3) a \\emph{dynamic index} that can support tuple insertions, while maintaining a one-shot sample or generating multiple (independent) samples. Our techniques achieve near-optimal time and space complexity with respect to the input size and the expected sample size."}

In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications."}

The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge.

We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {à} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\\subset\\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\\mathbb{H}\\subset\\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\\mathrm{U}$.

However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution. In these simulations, we found that generalized ESS improves the maximum transmission rate by 0.0425 bit/symbol at a frame error rate below 10^{-4} compared to CCDM."}

In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks."}
