Although we know optimal online\nalgorithms with $\\ell_p$-norm objectives, recent developments for general norms\nand convex objectives that rely on the online primal-dual framework apply only\nto fractional settings due to large integrality gaps.\n  Our work focuses on directly designing integral online algorithms for Set\nCover and Load Balancing with convex objectives, bypassing the\nconvex-relaxation and the primal-dual technique. Some of the main implications\nare:\n  1. For Online Set Cover, we can extend the results of Azar et. al. (2016) for\nconvex objectives and of Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024) for symmetric\nnorms from fractional to integral settings.\n  2. Our results for convex objectives and symmetric norms even apply to the\nonline generalized scheduling problem, which generalizes both Set Cover and\nLoad Balancing. Previous works could only handle the offline version of this\nproblem with norm objectives (Deng, Li, and Rabani 2023).\n  3. Our methods easily extend to settings with disjoint-composition of norms.\nThis allows us to recover or improve the norm-composition results of Nagarajan\nand Shen (2020), and Kesselheim, Molinaro, and Singla (2024), and to extend our\nresults to a large class of norms beyond symmetric.\n  Our approach is to first reduce these problems to online packing problems,\nand then to design good approximation algorithms for the latter. To solve these\npacking problems, we use two key ideas. First, we decouple the global packing\nproblem into a series of local packing problems on different machines.

This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes\napplications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically\nincorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment\ndamage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce\nPKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in\nAI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical\nphysics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation\nlaws, and thermodynamic principles.

While explainable artificial\nintelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying\ninfluential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking\nstrategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance\nvia fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the\nunderlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In\nthis work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces\nmasked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from\ngenerative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating\nmasked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them\nrelative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our\nmethod offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and\ndistribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that\ndirectly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.\nWe demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking\nmodel explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets\nand property prediction tasks.

While machine learning models hold\npromise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack\ninterpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure\ninherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled\nVariational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates\ntranscriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific\nencoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a\nmodular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn\nbiologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and\nmetabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four\ncancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response\n(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance\nmechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal\nsignaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous\nbiological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations\nof tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes\nand known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate\ninterpretable, clinically relevant insights.

Using\nsimulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural\nnetwork on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift\ncoefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive\nthe net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time\nseries, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and\nobject-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a\nlanguage model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence\nlong-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift\ntrajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,\n$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different\nobjects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and\ntraditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and\ntemporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal\nmodels perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term\nforecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings\ndemonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate\nand adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime\nconditions."}

Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be\nmeasured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of\ncovariates $\\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label\ncovariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate\nProbit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be\nreliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this\narticle, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli\nand Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel\nconditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to\nobserve each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all\nmodels measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the\nstrength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent\ncovariance is present for data where constant covariance is present.

Additionally, these databases\nsuffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging\nrecords near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant\nrecords. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a\ntransparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,\nmagnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and\nadded linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each\nterm. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field\nlarge magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller\nmagnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most\ndamaging scenarios.

In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework\nthat constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select\nrelevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle\nselection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a\nrewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced\ndiameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to\nexisting rewiring methods.
