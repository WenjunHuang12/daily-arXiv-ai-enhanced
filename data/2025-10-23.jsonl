Moreover, the introduction of recently\ndeveloped movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the\nperformance gains of ISAC systems. Achieving these gains can pose a significant\nchallenge for MA-enabled ISAC systems operating in the near-field due to the\ncorresponding spherical wave propagation. Motivated by this, in this paper we\nmaximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining\na minimal sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To\nachieve this goal, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the sensing receive\ncombiner, the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer\nand the positions of the users' MAs in an alternating manner. Simulation\nresults show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial\nperformance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems with only fixed\nantennas. Additionally, we demonstrate that the highest WSR is obtained when\nlarger weights are allocated to the users placed closer to the BS, and that the\nsensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the\ncommunication performance."}

However, such spatial sparsity\nof EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG\nspatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from\nsparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal\ndistortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and\nvisualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware\nresidual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as\ndynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual\ncondition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and\nspatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process\ntoward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed\nresidual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps,\nthen a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to\nproduce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts\nstep-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density\nrecovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive\nevaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics\nacross SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales.

With this observation in mind, we take a first\nstep beyond the fixed-quota paradigm and introduce proportionality notions\nwhere the quota is instance-dependent. We demonstrate that all commonly studied\nvoting rules can have an additive distance to the optimum of\n$\\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$. Moreover, we look into the computational aspects of our\ninstance-dependent quota and prove that determining the optimal value of\n$\\alpha$ for a given approval profile satisfying $\\alpha$-JR is NP-complete. To\naddress this, we introduce an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for\ncomputing committees that satisfy $\\alpha$-JR, and we provide positive results\nin the voter interval (VI) and candidate interval (CI) domains."}

The suffix array\n$SA_T[1..n]$ of a text $T$ of length $n$ encodes the lexicographic order of its\nsuffixes and underlies numerous applications in pattern matching, data\ncompression, and bioinformatics. Previous work established one-way reductions\nshowing how suffix array queries can be answered using, for example, rank\nqueries on the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. More recently, a new class of prefix\nqueries was introduced, together with reductions that, among others, transform\na simple tradeoff for prefix-select queries into a suffix array tradeoff\nmatching state-of-the-art space and query-time bounds, while achieving\nsublinear construction time. For binary texts, the resulting data structure\nachieves space $O(n)$ bits, preprocessing time $O(n / \\sqrt{\\log n})$,\npreprocessing space of $O(n)$ bits, and query time $O(\\log^{\\epsilon} n)$ for\nany constant $\\epsilon > 0$. However, whether these bounds could be improved\nusing different techniques has remained open.\n  We resolve this question by presenting the first bidirectional reduction\nshowing that suffix array queries are, up to an additive $O(\\log\\log n)$ term\nin query time, equivalent to prefix-select queries in all parameters. This\nresult unifies prior approaches and shows that essentially all efficient suffix\narray representations can be expressed via prefix-select structures. Moreover,\nwe prove analogous equivalences for inverse suffix array queries, pattern\nranking, lexicographic range, and SA-interval queries, identifying six core\nproblem pairs that connect string and prefix query models. Our framework thus\nprovides a unified foundation for analyzing and improving the efficiency of\nfundamental string-processing problems through the lens of prefix queries."}

Nearly all\nfundamental queries can currently be efficiently supported in\n$O(\\delta(T)\\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, where $\\delta(T)$ is the substring\ncomplexity, a strong compressibility measure that lower-bounds the optimal\nspace to represent the text [Kociumaka, Navarro, Prezza, IEEE Trans. Inf.\nTheory 2023]. However, optimal query time has been characterized only for\nrandom access.\n  We address this gap by developing tight lower bounds for nearly all other\nfundamental queries: (1) We prove that suffix array (SA), inverse suffix array\n(SA$^{-1}$), longest common prefix (LCP) array, and longest common extension\n(LCE) queries all require $\\Omega(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ time within\n$O(\\delta(T)\\log^{O(1)}n)$ space, matching known upper bounds.

This work\nestablishes a clean dichotomy: the optimal time complexity to support central\nstring queries in compressed space is either $\\Theta(\\log n/\\log\\log n)$ or\n$\\Theta(\\log\\log n)$. This completes the theoretical foundation of compressed\nindexing, closing a crucial gap between upper and lower bounds and providing a\nclear target for future data structures: seeking either the optimal time in the\nsmallest space or the fastest time in the optimal space, both of which are now\nknown for central string queries."}
