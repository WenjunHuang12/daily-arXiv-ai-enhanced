### [1] [Learning Ising Models under Hard Constraints using One Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20993)
*Rohan Chauhan,Ioannis Panageas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在截断伊辛模型中仅使用单个样本估计逆温度参数β的方法，该方法基于伪似然最大化，能够在有界度图和k-SAT公式表示的截断集条件下实现一致性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在截断伊辛模型中仅使用单个样本来准确估计逆温度参数β，这对于理解受限状态空间下的统计物理系统具有重要意义。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的方法，推广了Daskalakis等人和Galanis等人的技术，处理更具挑战性的截断伊辛模型设置。

Result: 设计了一个在近O(n)时间内运行的估计器，在k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³条件下，该估计器与真实参数β*具有O(Δ³/√n)一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将伪似然最大化技术扩展到截断伊辛模型，为单样本参数估计问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

### [2] [A Theory of Multi-Agent Generative Flow Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20408)
*Leo Maxime Brunswic,Haozhi Wang,Shuang Luo,Jianye Hao,Amir Rasouli,Yinchuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了多智能体生成流网络的理论框架，包括四种算法，实现了集中训练与分散执行，并通过实验证明了其优于强化学习和MCMC方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成流网络使用流匹配损失学习生成对象的随机策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，包括集中式流网络、独立流网络、联合流网络及其条件版本，基于局部-全局原则进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提框架在性能上优于强化学习和MCMC方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets框架为多智能体协作生成对象提供了理论基础和有效算法，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

### [3] [Sig2Model: A Boosting-Driven Model for Updatable Learned Indexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20781)
*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效的自适应学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化技术，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提高了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上效率很高，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为需要全局模型重训练来维持CDF不变性，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法无法有效解决这些重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化，延迟全量重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上的评估显示，Sig2Model相比最先进的可更新学习索引，重训练成本降低达20倍，QPS提高达3倍，内存使用减少达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的自适应技术有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能瓶颈，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

### [4] [FastEagle: Cascaded Drafting for Accelerating Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20416)
*Haiduo Huang,Jiangcheng Song,Wenzhe Zhao,Pengju Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，替代了传统草稿器的顺序依赖，实现了无损LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来提出N个标记，存在效率瓶颈。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿过程中的顺序依赖来加速推理。

Method: FastEagle采用非自回归级联草稿器设计，用轻量级层级联替换时间步骤，并通过层间监督训练来减轻错误累积。结合约束草稿树保持无损验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下均优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可接受的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿中的顺序依赖是实现无损LLM推理加速的实用路径。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

### [5] [mloz: A Highly Efficient Machine Learning-Based Ozone Parameterization for Climate Sensitivity Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20422)
*Yiling Ma,Nathan Luke Abraham,Stefan Versick,Roland Ruhnke,Andrea Schneidereit,Ulrike Niemeier,Felix Back,Peter Braesicke,Peer Nowack*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种机器学习参数化方法（mloz），用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧的日变化和趋势，解决了传统化学方案计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于大气化学方案计算成本高而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这限制了气候敏感性模拟的准确性。

Method: 开发基于机器学习的参数化方法，仅使用大气温度剖面信息作为输入，在两个不同气候模型（UKESM和ICON）中进行在线测试。

Result: mloz比UKESM中的化学方案快约31倍，仅占总运行时间的不到4%，且在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，并能跨模型迁移。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在缺乏交互式化学的CMIP级气候模型中广泛采用，特别是在关注气候敏感性模拟时，臭氧趋势和变率对大气反馈过程有重要调节作用。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

*Kay Fuhrmeister,Arne Pelzer,Fabian Radke,Julia Lechinger,Mahzad Gharleghi,Thomas Köllmer,Insa Wolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于transformer的自编码器来匿名化EEG数据，在保持睡眠分期等机器学习任务效用的同时防止主体重识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，用户隐私保护需求日益迫切，需要找到既能保护敏感EEG数据又能保留其应用价值的方法

Method: 使用transformer-based autoencoder对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，评估匿名化前后数据的主体重识别能力和睡眠分期任务的性能

Result: EEG信号的重识别能力显著降低，同时机器学习任务的效用得到保持

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少EEG数据的可重识别性，同时保留其在机器学习应用中的实用性

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

### [7] [Efficiently Attacking Memorization Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20463)
*Tue Do,Varun Chandrasekaran,Daniel Alabi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于记忆化评分的影响估计工具在对抗性攻击下的脆弱性，提出了一种实用的攻击方法，并验证了即使是最先进的影响估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着影响估计工具在数据估值和负责任机器学习中的广泛应用，需要评估这些评分本身是否可能被对抗性操纵，以确保其可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出了一种实用的攻击方法，通过计算输入的伪逆来产生高度记忆化的样本，仅需黑盒访问模型输出且计算开销适中。

Result: 在广泛的图像分类任务上验证了攻击的有效性，表明即使最先进的影响估计代理也容易受到针对性分数操纵。理论分析揭示了影响估计在对抗性扰动下的固有脆弱性条件。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了基于影响的归因方法存在严重漏洞，表明需要开发鲁棒的防御机制来保护影响估计工具免受对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

### [8] [Offline Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Quasimetric Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20478)
*Vivek Myers,Bill Chunyuan Zheng,Benjamin Eysenbach,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一对比表示和时序距离框架的方法，通过拟度量表示空间结构和额外约束学习后继表示，实现最优目标达成，在次优数据和随机环境中仍能学习最优距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标条件强化学习（GCRL）方法主要使用对比表示或时序距离两种框架，但各自存在局限性。对比表示方法在拼接任务上表现不佳，而拟度量网络方法在高维噪声环境中表现较差。需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 使用拟度量表示空间结构（三角不等式）和额外约束学习后继表示，能够利用拟度量距离参数化在次优数据和随机环境中学习最优目标达成距离。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，在拟度量网络方法难以处理的高维噪声环境中也表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了蒙特卡洛对比RL方法的稳定性和长时程能力，以及拟度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力，实现了两种框架的优势互补。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

*D. Darankoum,C. Habermacher,J. Volle,S. Grudinin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端深度学习框架，通过多尺度频率振荡编码器、注意力机制和门控网络处理EEG信号，解决噪声和通道变异性问题，在多种中枢神经系统疾病分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号包含丰富的多尺度信息，但如何从原始信号中提取有意义的特征，同时处理噪声和通道变异性是一个主要挑战。

Method: 设计多尺度频率振荡编码器、基于注意力的编码器学习通道间和通道内依赖关系、门控网络动态过滤噪声通道、结合监督和对比学习的新型损失函数。

Result: 在多种中枢神经系统疾病分类任务中验证，能够提取生物学有意义的模式，自主选择高质量通道，实现鲁棒泛化。

Conclusion: 所提出的学习范式通过创新的架构和损失设计，能够从不同物种的原始EEG信号中提取有意义的模式，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

### [10] [Beyond Visual Similarity: Rule-Guided Multimodal Clustering with explicit domain rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20501)
*Kishor Datta Gupta,Mohd Ariful Haque,Marufa Kamal,Ahmed Rafi Hasan,Md. Mahfuzur Rahman,Roy George*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DARTVAE框架，将领域特定规则嵌入到变分自编码器中，实现规则指导的多模态聚类，相比传统聚类方法能产生更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。需要一种能够将领域特定约束直接融入表示学习过程的聚类框架。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，通过损失函数中的规则一致性和违反惩罚来嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征。规则由LLM生成，构建为知识图谱，损失函数结合重构损失、KL散度、一致性惩罚和违反惩罚。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则指导的聚类能产生更具操作意义的聚类（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束指导的多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但面临LLM生成规则可能产生幻觉或冲突、规则过多导致过拟合等挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

*Evgenii Egorov,Hanno Ackermann,Markus Nagel,Hong Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种结合稀疏注意力与循环依赖优势的新算法，基于树结构矩阵的高效求逆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力层存在二次复杂度问题，现有解决方案（稀疏化或循环依赖）各有缺点，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 通过树结构矩阵的高效求逆技术，将稀疏注意力与循环依赖方法相结合。

Result: 开发出能够克服现有方法缺点的新算法。

Conclusion: 该算法为处理长序列提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度学习方法来预测混凝土中随时间变化的全场损伤。研究使用自回归U-Net模型预测给定微观结构几何形状和收缩剖面演化下的标量损伤场演化，并通过CNN利用损伤估计预测关键力学性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全场损伤评估计算负荷大，需要开发更高效的方法来优化混凝土配合比设计，提高耐久性并减少内部损伤。

Method: 采用双网络架构：自回归U-Net模型用于预测损伤场演化，CNN用于基于损伤估计预测力学性能（收缩和残余刚度）。

Result: 该方法在合成数据集上表现出高计算效率和稳健的预测性能，显著降低了传统全场损伤评估的计算负荷。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于深入了解骨料特性与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系，可优化混凝土配合比设计，提高耐久性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

*Luca Serfilippi,Giorgio Franceschelli,Antonio Corradi,Mirco Musolesi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出用复杂度奖励替代熵奖励的新算法CDPO，通过平衡随机性和结构化来提升探索效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵最大化方法将策略推向均匀随机分布，这种无结构的探索策略有时效率低下，需要更鲁棒的探索机制

Method: 基于PPO算法，用复杂度奖励替代熵奖励。复杂度定义为香农熵与不平衡度的乘积，不平衡度量化了与均匀分布的距离

Result: 在离散动作空间任务中，CDPO比PPO对超参数选择更鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够鼓励策略在随机性和结构化之间取得平衡，引导智能体发现有用且非平凡的行为策略

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来分析基于确定性扩散模型的逆问题求解算法，证明了当数据分布集中在低维模型集上时，噪声卷积分数可解释为时变投影，并建立了在受限等距性质下的定量收敛率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成扩散模型在逆问题中表现出强大的数据驱动先验能力，但严格的恢复保证仍然有限。本文旨在为基于扩散的逆问题算法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 开发理论框架分析确定性扩散算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将现有算法视为带有时变投影的广义投影梯度下降方法。

Result: 当感知矩阵在模型集上满足受限等距性质时，可以推导出显式依赖噪声调度的定量收敛率。在低维紧凸集和低秩高斯混合模型等数据分布上验证了理论框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了理论保证，即使在非凸模型集上也能建立全局收敛性，为扩散先验的严格分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

*Amirmohammad Ziaei Bideh,Aleksandra Georgievska,Jonathan Gryak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDBench是一个开源基准测试框架，用于评估动态系统模型发现方法，评估了12种算法在14个PDE和63个ODE上的表现，发现线性方法和遗传编程方法分别在PDE和ODE上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对动态模型发现的全面基准测试，现有研究多关注单一方程的识别，需要系统评估模型发现方法的性能。

Method: 开发MDBench框架，在噪声条件下评估12种算法在14个PDE和63个ODE上的表现，使用导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度等指标。

Result: 线性方法在PDE上误差最低，遗传编程在ODE上表现最佳；线性模型对噪声更具鲁棒性；当前方法在处理流体动力学和热力学等复杂PDE系统时存在局限。

Conclusion: MDBench为模型发现方法提供了严谨、可扩展的基准测试框架，促进该领域方法的系统性评估和改进。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

*Weixin Chen,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了神经概率电路（NPC）的对抗鲁棒性，并提出RNPC方法，通过类间集成推理提高对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NPC模型虽然具有可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模块容易受到对抗攻击，可能影响最终预测结果。

Method: 提出RNPC方法，采用新颖的类间集成推理机制，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。

Result: 理论分析证明RNPC比NPC具有更好的对抗鲁棒性，实验结果显示RNPC在图像分类任务中优于现有概念瓶颈模型。

Conclusion: RNPC在保持良性输入高准确率的同时，显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

*Athar Parvez,Muhammad Jawad Mufti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究比较了两种混合机器学习分类器（XGBoost+随机森林 vs SVM+逻辑回归）在糖尿病风险分层中的性能，并在外部队列上验证了其泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超过5.37亿人，预计到2045年将达到7.83亿。早期风险分层可以从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的性能和泛化能力。

Method: 构建了两种混合分类器：XGBoost+随机森林和SVM+逻辑回归。采用泄漏安全的标准化流程（编码、插补、最小-最大缩放；仅在训练折叠上使用SMOTE；SVM概率校准），在主数据集上拟合并冻结流程。外部验证使用PIMA队列（N=768）。

Result: 在主数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC ~0.995，AUPRC ~0.998）优于SVM-LR（AUROC ~0.978，AUPRC ~0.947）。在PIMA队列上，XGB-RF保持强劲性能（AUROC ~0.990，AUPRC ~0.959），而SVM-LR较低（AUROC ~0.963，AUPRC ~0.875）。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，在ROC/PR上表现出较小的外部衰减和可接受的校准。这些结果支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健、可转移方法。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

TL;DR: 提出PIRF方法，将物理约束生成建模为稀疏奖励优化问题，通过轨迹级奖励直接反向传播梯度，避免DPS式值函数近似误差，提高物理约束遵从度和采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域生成能力强但常违反物理定律，现有方法依赖DPS式值函数近似导致误差、训练不稳定和推理效率低

Method: PIRF方法：计算轨迹级奖励直接反向传播梯度，采用层级截断反向传播利用物理奖励的时空局部性，以及基于权重的正则化方案提高效率

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下持续实现优越的物理约束执行效果

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对贝叶斯神经网络（BNNs）的超参数进行了全局敏感性分析，揭示了超参数之间的相互作用对预测精度和不确定性量化（UQ）的影响，并建议使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化来改进BNNs在实际应用中的超参数选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络在科学应用中需要准确的不确定性量化，但实际中由于训练近似和超参数选择困难，难以获得准确的UQ。超参数数量多且影响不透明，因此需要研究其影响。

Method: 通过全局敏感性分析，研究BNNs在不同超参数设置下的性能表现，分析超参数之间的相互作用。

Result: 研究发现许多超参数相互作用，共同影响预测精度和不确定性量化。超参数之间的复杂交互关系对BNNs性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法，以降低维度并选择适当的超参数，确保BNNs能够提供准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Conclusion: Neural FMM成功地将传统数值算法FMM与神经网络结合，为椭圆PDE的格林算子学习提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern
machine learning architectures remains underexplored. In this work, we propose
a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

evaluate our method on popular datasets and demonstrate its enhanced accuracy
in QoE prediction, while offering transparency and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一类新的稳定、近似可逆的Runge-Kutta方案（EES方案），用于解决神经随机微分方程（SDE）求解器在反向传播中的内存效率和梯度精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经SDE求解器反向传播方法存在两个问题：离散化后优化方法内存成本高，优化后离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有的代数可逆求解器虽然承诺内存效率和梯度精度，但在复杂模型和大步长下往往不稳定。

Method: 开发了显式且有效对称（EES）的Runge-Kutta方案，这些方案保留了可逆求解器的优点，同时克服了其不稳定性，能够在不受步长或模型复杂性严格限制的情况下实现内存高效训练。

Result: 通过数值实验证明，EES方案具有优越的稳定性和可靠性，为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用基础。

Conclusion: EES方案成功解决了神经SDE训练中的内存效率与梯度精度之间的权衡问题，为复杂模型和大步长情况下的稳定训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Result: 该方法通过了自一致性测试，在性能上超越了传统和基于分数的扩散互信息估计器，即使在高互信息情况下也能保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: 扩散模型提供了一种直接有效的互信息估计途径，通过自适应重要性采样实现了可扩展且稳健的估计性能。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架有效解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和泛化的分层策略提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

Conclusion: PFedDL框架有效解决了多站点神经影像分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

TL;DR: 提出CERMIC框架，通过动态校准内在好奇心与推断的多智能体上下文来增强多智能体探索能力，在稀疏奖励环境中显著优于现有最先进算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有好奇心机制在去中心化、无通信的多智能体强化学习中存在两个问题：1）将环境随机性误认为有意义的新颖性；2）对所有意外观察采用统一的新颖性偏好，忽视了包含潜在任务动态的同伴行为新颖性。

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴自适应校准探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架：1）鲁棒过滤噪声惊喜信号；2）动态校准内在好奇心与推断的多智能体上下文；3）生成理论上有依据的内在奖励，鼓励探索具有高信息增益的状态转移。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，CERMIC在稀疏奖励环境中的探索性能显著优于现有最先进算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过有效整合多智能体上下文信息，解决了现有好奇心机制在多智能体探索中的局限性，为稀疏奖励环境下的多智能体强化学习提供了更有效的探索策略。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

TL;DR: 开发基于机器学习的策略来预测大规模并行化学计算所需的资源成本，以指导用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵实验前的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在超级计算机上运行昂贵化学计算（如耦合簇方法）时面临的两个关键问题：如何找到最短执行时间的参数配置，以及如何最小化资源使用成本。

Method: 评估了一系列机器学习模型和策略，基于在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上运行的CCSD应用程序的运行时参数值集合。使用梯度提升模型预测执行时间，并探索主动学习策略在数据收集成本高时的应用。

Result: 梯度提升模型在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差分别为0.023和0.073。主动学习策略仅需约450个实验数据点即可达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算资源需求，梯度提升模型表现出色，主动学习策略在数据稀缺情况下仍能提供可接受的预测精度。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习(ICL)虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感。现有方法缺乏对所需演示样本数量的理论指导，导致实践中难以确定最优提示长度。

Method: 基于高维亚高斯表示建立ICL稳定性的非渐近下界，提出两阶段可观测估计器，通过一次性校准产生无需分布先验的提示长度估计。

Result: 在多样化数据集、编码器和生成器上的实验显示，预测阈值与经验拐点紧密对齐，理论边界作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小了差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，架起了理论与部署之间的桥梁，提高了大规模提示在有限样本场景下的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Bispectral Optimal Transport，一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，在对称丰富的设置中比传统几何距离方法更好地保留类别结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称丰富的环境中，仅基于原始特征间几何距离的最优传输对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构，无法有效处理由群作用引起的变异。

Method: 引入Bispectral Optimal Transport，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示保留所有信号结构同时移除仅由群作用引起的变化。

Result: 在经视觉对称变换的基准数据集上，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划比传统特征OT实现了更高的类别保持准确率。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够提高有意义的对应关系的质量，捕获数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时移除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织间协作微调LLM具有吸引力，但数据共享存在隐私顾虑。联邦学习被认为能保护隐私，但作者发现现有认知存在矛盾，需要验证FL在LLM微调中的实际隐私保护效果。

Method: 通过大量实验验证数据泄漏风险，包括使用简单生成方法提取训练数据，并提出专门针对FL的增强攻击策略（跟踪全局模型更新）。同时评估差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等隐私保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者能从全局模型中提取训练数据，泄漏程度随模型规模增大而增加。增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄漏。评估的隐私保护技术在一定程度上能降低风险。

Conclusion: FL框架下的LLM微调仍存在显著隐私风险，需要采用适当的隐私保护措施。研究为降低FL训练LLM的隐私风险提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型通常通过简单拼接融合配体和蛋白质表示，缺乏显式几何正则化，导致在化学空间和时间上的泛化能力较差。

Method: 使用FiLM层将分子嵌入条件化到蛋白质嵌入上，通过三元组损失强制度量结构，并使用基于嵌入距离的RBF回归头进行平滑可解释的亲和力预测。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明条件化和度量学习对于稳健的药物-靶点亲和力预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust
drug-target affinity prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO及其变体在强化学习优化大语言模型时，由于裁剪机制会丢弃低概率token的梯度信号，而这些token对调节熵动态具有关键作用，需要一种新方法来保留这些梯度。

Method: 提出CE-GPPO算法，以温和有界的方式重新引入被PPO裁剪的token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度大小来实现探索-利用平衡。

Result: 理论分析和实验证据表明CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，在数学推理基准测试中在不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO通过梯度保留机制成功解决了PPO中梯度信号丢失问题，为RL优化LLMs提供了更稳定的熵控制方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Motivation: 受到遗传算法有效性和分子设计中可合成性重要性的启发，开发一个能够直接约束在可合成分子空间的方法。

Method: 使用遗传算法，定制交叉和变异算子来约束可合成性，通过修改适应度函数适应不同设计任务，还可结合机器学习过滤器优化构建块集。

Conclusion: SynGA是一个轻量级且确保可合成性的方法，既可作为独立基线，也可作为模块集成到更大的合成感知工作流中。

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了深度学习中的缩放定律本质上是冗余定律，证明了缩放指数取决于数据冗余度而非普遍性，并通过核回归、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构验证了该理论的普适性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的缩放定律表现出模型性能随数据集和模型规模呈幂律增长的特征，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数一直缺乏理论解释。

Method: 使用核回归方法，分析数据协方差谱的多项式尾部，推导出超额风险的幂律关系，并在有界可逆变换、多模态混合、有限宽度近似和Transformer架构（包括线性化和特征学习机制）中进行验证。

Result: 发现缩放定律的指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)，其中β控制谱尾部，1/β衡量冗余度，表明学习曲线的斜率不是普适的而是依赖于数据冗余度。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其视为有限样本冗余定律，统一了经验观察与理论基础。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

Method: 构建水印增强的训练和评估数据集（Watermark-Spoofing数据集），应用多种手工和神经网络水印方法到现有反欺骗数据集上，并提出知识保持水印学习（KPWL）框架。

Result: 实验表明水印会持续降低反欺骗性能，水印密度越高，等错误率（EER）越高。KPWL框架能帮助模型适应水印引起的域偏移，同时保持原始域的反欺骗检测能力。

Conclusion: 音频水印是一个先前被忽视的域偏移因素，本研究为开发抗水印反欺骗系统建立了首个基准。

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

TL;DR: 本研究对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)进行超参数敏感性评估，分析不同架构深度对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GAN和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高。需要评估超参数选择对数据质量和计算性能的敏感性，为实际应用提供指导。

Method: 在两个工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)上评估10种不同架构类型和深度的模型配置，从运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布的相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两个工具都能实现高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: REaLTabFormer与轻量级LLMs提供了最佳平衡，能在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限制。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

Conclusion: 结合MLP和CNN的方法能有效解决时间序列预测中的非平稳性问题，IConv架构通过独立通道处理实现了更好的局部模式建模

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，可在任何神经网络训练设置中提升模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，且不依赖数据增强或高级正则化技术。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

### [43] [Aligning Inductive Bias for Data-Efficient Generalization in State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20789)
*Qiyu Chen,Guozhang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务依赖初始化（TDI）方法，通过功率谱匹配来调整状态空间模型（SSMs）的归纳偏置，使其与任务的光谱特征对齐，从而提高数据效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。状态空间模型等基础序列模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务结构与偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：通过功率谱匹配在训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著提高了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的鲁棒公平性问题，显著提升了最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法忽视了鲁棒公平性，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性存在严重差异。研究发现两个关键问题：等比例类别数据蒸馏的学生模型在不同类别间表现差异显著；学生模型的鲁棒性在不同攻击目标下不稳定。

Method: FERD框架采用两个策略：1）鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略，为鲁棒性较差的类别合成更多样本；2）生成互补数据样本，包括通过特征级预测均匀约束生成公平感知样本（FAEs），以及应用均匀目标类别约束生成均匀目标对抗样本（UTAEs）。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性。例如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD框架在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的鲁棒公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

*Hwa Hui Tew,Junn Yong Loo,Yee-Fan Tan,Xinyu Tang,Hernando Ombao,Fuad Noman,Raphael C. -W. Phan,Chee-Ming Ting*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个基于时间-频率表示和去噪扩散的fMRI生成框架，通过将BOLD信号转换为窗口谱图并训练分类器无关的扩散模型来生成高质量的fMRI数据，解决了传统生成模型在捕捉复杂BOLD动态方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本稀缺，而现有生成模型往往忽略BOLD信号的非平稳性和非线性动态，导致生成效果不佳。

Method: 首先通过时间相关傅里叶变换将BOLD信号转换为窗口谱图，捕捉时空动态和频谱演化；然后训练分类器无关的扩散模型生成类条件频率谱图；最后通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在下游fMRI脑网络分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架有效解决了fMRI数据生成中的挑战，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了高质量的合成数据。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的时间序列字幕基准，包含465k训练和105k测试时间戳，整合了数值序列、元数据、线图和字幕，并提供了新的评估指标和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列字幕基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的字幕，且忽略了元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集构建字幕和问答任务，使用可扩展的流水线生成参考字幕（主要通过oracle LLM生成并经过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证），并提供579个人工修订的测试字幕。

Result: 建立了包含460个多选题的基准，评估了领先的视觉语言模型，展示了它们的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕流水线为时间序列分析和基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中的晚期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）机制及其关系尚不明确，需要统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过神经坍缩理论分析学习表示的几何特性，研究类内方差收缩的动态过程，并在多个数据集和架构上进行验证。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的共同关键因素，不同时间尺度（训练集拟合与神经坍缩进展）解释了晚期现象的行为。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为理解深度神经网络训练晚期现象提供了统一框架，类内方差收缩是这些现象的核心机制。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段训练框架来解决多模态融合中的模态竞争问题，通过单模态训练塑造初始状态，引入有效竞争强度(ECS)概念，并开发了基于互信息和部分信息分解的计算框架来指导异步训练控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态融合在联合训练中经常出现模态竞争问题，其中一个模态主导学习过程，导致其他模态优化不足。现有方法大多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，而忽视了模型初始状态的关键影响。

Method: 1) 提出有效竞争强度(ECS)概念量化模态竞争强度；2) 开发基于互信息和部分信息分解的计算框架；3) 设计异步训练控制器动态平衡模态并定位理想初始状态；4) 采用两阶段训练：单模态预训练后联合训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，证明了塑造预融合模型初始状态是缓解模态竞争的有效策略。

Conclusion: 通过单模态训练塑造初始状态是一种强大的策略，能够在竞争开始前就缓解模态竞争问题，可靠地实现协同多模态融合。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Motivation: 多组学数据能捕捉复杂的生物分子相互作用，但缺失模态会阻碍异质组学数据的整合分析。需要一种能够处理不完整多组学数据的方法。

Method: MOIRA采用早期整合方法，将每个组学数据集投影到共享嵌入空间，通过可学习的加权机制进行融合，利用所有样本（包括缺失模态的样本）。

Conclusion: MOIRA能够有效处理缺失模态的多组学数据整合，在阿尔茨海默病研究中显示出生物学相关性，为多组学数据分析提供了稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

Motivation: 当前对LLM推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间相互作用的理解不足，需要系统评估不同推理策略的有效性。

Method: 构建StyleBench基准，评估5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上的表现，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 没有单一最优推理风格；搜索方法在开放性问题表现好但需要大模型；简洁风格在定义明确任务上效率高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令；推理鲁棒性随模型规模提升。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常出现延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是即时的。随机传感器延迟导致观测数据可能乱序到达，这在RL中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出了基于模型的滤波过程，顺序更新信念状态；开发了延迟感知框架，将其集成到基于模型的RL中；在Dreamer算法上应用该框架。

Result: 与为MDP开发的延迟感知基线相比，该方法始终表现更优，并在部署期间对延迟分布变化表现出鲁棒性。在模拟机器人任务上的实验也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 明确建模观测延迟对于处理现实环境中的延迟问题至关重要，提出的方法为随机延迟环境下的RL提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过控制标签分布来缓解数据不平衡问题，实验证明该方法能有效提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法主要通过客户端选择来缓解这一问题。

Method: 扩展现有联邦学习策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦联合标签分布）对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 实验在三种常见联邦学习策略和两个数据集上进行，结果显示：面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦联合标签分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效改善联邦学习中的数据不平衡问题，针对不同类型的不平衡需要采用不同的目标分布策略。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICU中败血症早期准确预测的挑战，克服单个医院数据量有限的问题，同时保护患者隐私

Method: 使用联邦学习的注意力增强LSTM模型，在多中心ICU数据上进行训练，支持可变预测窗口实现短期和长期预测

Result: 联邦学习不仅提高了整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），而且特别有利于早期败血症发病预测，可变预测窗口减少了计算和通信开销

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时有效提高了败血症早期检测能力，可变预测窗口设计在性能损失不大的情况下显著降低了系统开销

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于马尔可夫链的离散状态扩散模型确定性去噪算法，通过引入具有弱混沌动力学的herding算法变体实现确定性离散状态转换，无需重新训练或连续状态嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离散扩散模型使用随机去噪过程，本文旨在开发确定性反向过程以提升效率和样本质量，探索确定性方法在离散状态空间的有效性。

Method: 基于马尔可夫链构建确定性去噪算法，采用herding算法的弱混沌动力学变体来诱导确定性离散状态转换，直接替代随机去噪过程。

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务上实现了效率和样本质量的一致提升，验证了确定性反向过程在离散状态空间的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种简单的确定性化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，证明确定性反向过程在离散状态空间同样有效。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

TL;DR: 开发深度学习框架，结合微观移动性特征、历史犯罪和社会人口统计数据，提升细粒度时空犯罪预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索微观移动性特征是否能够增强细粒度时空犯罪预测的准确性，填补现有研究在数据源整合方面的空白

Method: 使用ConvLSTM网络，结合14天和2天输入序列，预测未来12小时的犯罪发生，并与逻辑回归、随机森林和标准LSTM基准模型比较

Result: 结合移动性和社会人口统计特征时获得最佳结果，深度学习模型在所有四个城市中均表现最优，长序列对暴力犯罪预测更有效，短序列对财产犯罪更有效

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据源对时空犯罪预测至关重要，深度学习在处理细粒度时空尺度时具有优势但也存在局限

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

*Weili Zeng,Yichao Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了流匹配方法在低噪声区域存在不稳定性问题，并提出了局部对比流（LCF）作为解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配框架在低噪声区域存在根本性不稳定性，当噪声水平趋近于零时，输入的微小扰动会导致速度目标的巨大变化，使学习问题的条件数发散，这不仅减慢优化速度，还迫使编码器将有限的雅可比容量重新分配给噪声方向，从而降低语义表示质量。

Method: 提出了局部对比流（LCF），这是一种混合训练协议，在小噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替换直接速度回归，同时在中高噪声水平下保留标准流匹配。

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量。

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理问题对于充分发挥流匹配在生成和表示学习中的潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

Motivation: 提高重型土方设备（特别是挖掘设备臂架）中线性执行器的能效，减少能量损失和环境影响。

Method: 使用MATLAB/Simulink进行液压回路仿真，比较传统PDCV回路与创新的PFCV回路（在作动器两端设置人工泄漏）。位置控制采用模糊控制器调谐的PID控制器。

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效提高8.5%，通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，从而降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

<details>

Motivation: 个性化医疗需要为患者找到最优治疗方案，但无法随意测试候选治疗，而现有的替代模型难以泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合。领域知识（如医学教科书和生物医学知识图谱）可以提供治疗适应性的替代信号。

Method: LEON是一种基于数学原理的方法，利用大型语言模型作为黑盒优化器，无需任务特定微调。通过'提示优化'实现，将LLMs作为随机引擎来提出治疗设计。

Result: 在真实世界优化任务上的实验表明，LEON在提出个体化治疗方案方面优于传统方法和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: LEON成功证明了利用LLMs结合领域知识进行个性化治疗优化的有效性，为个性化医疗提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for
proposing treatment designs. Experiments on real-world optimization tasks show
LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不合理或不直观，需要开发能够产生合理且用户可理解的反事实解释的新方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器，整合对比学习和分类一致性目标，采用原型初始化和现实性约束优化来生成反事实解释。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据集上，GenFacts在合理性方面比最先进基线方法提升18.7%，在人类研究中获得最高可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，合理性和用户中心的可解释性比稀疏性更为关键。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域至关重要，但高标注成本和数据不平衡限制了GNN的性能表现。

Method: FracAug学习图内语义并合成分数变体，使用加权距离感知边界损失来生成多样化的语义保持图，然后利用原始图和增强图的预测结果进行伪标注，迭代扩展训练集。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上的14种GNN实验中，FracAug将平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提升了5.72%、7.23%和4.18%。

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够显著提升图级异常检测性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

*Zida Liang,Jiayi Zhu,Weiqiang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过实验研究发现，Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳的原因在于注意力机制失效，Transformer块往往退化为简单的MLP，主要原因是当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer在NLP和CV领域表现出色，但在时间序列预测中甚至不如简单线性基线，但之前的研究未能深入探索Transformer失效的原因。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，逐步将Transformer修改为MLP来研究注意力机制的影响；设计了可解释的数据集来研究注意力机制失效的原因；进行了理论分析。

Result: 发现Transformer块在现有时间序列Transformer中经常退化为简单MLP；注意力机制没有按预期方式工作；当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中工作。

Conclusion: Transformer在时间序列预测中的失败主要源于嵌入方法的不足，导致注意力机制失效，需要重新设计适合时间序列特性的嵌入方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了解耦值注意力（DVA）机制，用于改进先验数据拟合网络（PFNs）在高维回归任务中的性能，使其能够更有效地替代计算密集的高斯过程推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在PFNs中处理高维回归任务时效果有限，而高斯过程的特性表明函数空间完全由输入核决定且预测均值是训练目标的加权和。这启发我们设计一种更符合高斯过程特性的注意力机制。

Method: 提出了解耦值注意力（DVA），该机制仅从输入计算相似度，并通过值传播标签，从而镜像高斯过程更新但保持无核特性。同时验证了局部注意力在PFNs中的重要性。

Result: 在5维和10维情况下，验证损失减少超过50%；64维电力流方程近似达到1E-3量级的平均绝对误差，比精确高斯过程推理快80倍以上；CNN-based PFNs与Transformer-based PFNs性能相当。

Conclusion: 注意力规则而非架构本身是扩展PFNs的关键因素，局部注意力能显著提升PFNs在高维回归任务中的性能，为快速物理系统代理模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解构LLM隐藏状态时依赖单实例正则化约束，缺乏全局稀疏性保证，导致特征密集化，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化程度。

Method: 提出二进制自编码器（BAE），通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，应用梯度估计实现反向传播，在小批量上实施最小熵约束来促进特征独立性和稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两方面表现优异：能可靠估计二进制隐藏激活的熵来表征LLM推理动态；相比基线方法避免了密集特征，产生了最多可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器具有有效性，通过熵最小化机制成功解决了特征稀疏性问题，为LLM机制解释提供了新工具。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注四个典型任务（预测、插补、异常检测、分类），但这些任务主要评估特定任务性能，无法严格衡量模型是否捕获了数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 引入无损压缩作为评估范式，建立标准化评估协议和指标，开发开源评估框架TSCom-Bench，使时间序列模型能够快速适配为无损压缩的骨干网络。

Result: 在多样化数据集上对包括TimeXer、iTransformer和PatchTST在内的最先进模型进行实验，证明压缩能够揭示经典基准测试忽略的分布弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Motivation: 多视图布尔电路学习具有巨大潜力，但不同图表示（如AIG与XMG）之间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是在自监督掩码建模中，跨视图上下文被视为噪声。

Method: 提出MixGate框架，采用原则性训练课程：首先通过等价对齐损失教导模型学习共享的、功能感知的表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标。

Result: 广泛的实验（包括关键消融研究）表明，对齐优先策略成功地将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素。

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习的必要先决条件，MixGate框架通过先对齐后建模的方法有效解决了多视图布尔电路学习的融合挑战。

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的新视角研究上下文学习机制，发现在零样本场景下语言模型产生非选择性表示导致任意输出，而选择性移除特定信息能有效引导模型朝向目标任务。研究表明少样本上下文学习通过模拟任务导向的信息移除过程来改善输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习作为一种新兴的少样本学习范式，其内部机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过信息移除的视角来揭示上下文学习的工作机制。

Method: 通过设计度量标准测量隐藏状态，观察少样本上下文学习如何模拟任务导向的信息移除过程。识别出诱导移除操作的关键注意力头（去噪头），并通过阻断信息移除操作进行消融实验。

Result: 研究发现零样本场景下语言模型产生非选择性表示导致接近零的准确率，而选择性信息移除能有效引导模型。消融实验显示阻断信息移除操作会显著降低上下文学习准确率，特别是在正确标签缺失的情况下。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是上下文学习的关键机制，去噪头在这一过程中发挥关键作用。少样本上下文学习通过选择性移除冗余信息来改善模型输出。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLUE框架，通过电路发现技术识别LLM中负责遗忘和保留的神经元，并使用CNF形式化表示来解决现有方法中神经元纠缠的问题，实现更精确的遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位的LLM遗忘方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致过度遗忘或目标知识擦除不完全的问题。

Method: 采用电路发现机制解释技术，识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转换为合取范式（CNF），通过CNF可满足性解确定每个神经元应被遗忘还是保留，并为不同类别神经元提供针对性微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经元定位实现了更优的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架通过解耦遗忘和保留神经元，解决了现有方法的局限性，为LLM安全遗忘提供了更精确有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

TL;DR: rBridge方法通过使用小模型（≤1B参数）来预测大模型（7B+参数）的推理能力，通过将预训练目标与目标任务对齐，并利用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，显著降低了数据集排名的成本（减少100倍以上）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大型语言模型的成本过高，需要利用小模型来优化数据集，但推理能力只在大模型中可靠出现，因此需要一种方法让小模型能够有效预测大模型的推理表现。

Method: rBridge通过加权负对数似然与任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，使小模型更接近预训练目标和目标任务。

Result: rBridge在1B到32B规模的六个推理基准测试中实现了最强的相关性，零样本转移了1B到7B规模预训练数据集的预测关系，并将数据集排名成本降低了100倍以上。

Conclusion: rBridge为以较低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

TL;DR: 提出E-CIT框架，通过分治策略将数据分成子集并行处理，显著降低条件独立性测试的计算复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果发现方法依赖大量条件独立性测试，计算成本过高，限制了实际应用

Method: 采用分治聚合策略：将数据分区，在每个子集上独立应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合p值

Result: E-CIT将基础CIT的计算复杂度降至样本大小的线性级别，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低计算负担

Conclusion: E-CIT是一种通用即插即用框架，在复杂测试场景特别是真实数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

TL;DR: LCR是一个实用的基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法增强LRU缓存策略，利用机器学习预测动态适应预测准确性，在准确预测时实现接近最优性能，在不准确预测时优雅降级到接近LRU性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，推荐模型中的嵌入命中率和LLM中的KV缓存未命中严重影响性能。启发式策略如LRU在结构化访问模式下表现不佳，而现有学习方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或预测准确时增益有限的问题。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU在LRU基础上集成机器学习预测，通过在线误差估计动态适应预测准确性。当预测准确时实现最优性能，预测不准确时优雅降级到LRU水平。

Result: 实验显示LCR在DLRM和LLM场景下，吞吐量提升最高24.2%，P99 TTFT降低最高28.3%，优于广泛使用的推理系统。即使在预测不佳时性能仍保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域架起了实证进展与理论进展之间的桥梁，提供了性能增益同时确保鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

TL;DR: 本研究通过边缘归因修补技术分析RL微调对LLM内部机制的影响，发现在线RL训练会增强激活强度和多样性，而DPO方法则表现出不同的内部变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL微调已被证明能提升LLM能力，但其对不同LLM内部工作机制的影响机制尚不明确，需要系统性的内部机制分析。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补(EAP)技术对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部激活差异，重点关注PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同RL方法。

Result: 发现在线RL训练导致：(1)整体激活强度增加，更多内部通路被激活；(2)激活模式多样性提高，熵值增加且边缘分布更分散。DPO方法的变化较弱或不一致。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流使其更具冗余性和灵活性来提升泛化能力，在线RL与基于偏好的方法在内部机制改变上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何问题求解需要准确的图解解释和跨模态对齐能力，但目前缺乏专门评估模型在几何图解中定位几何元素能力的方法。

Method: 构建GeoRef基准数据集，使用结构化几何形式语言生成大规模合成训练数据，采用监督微调和GRPO两种微调方法，并提出验证-再生机制来纠正错误预测。

Result: GRPO方法显著优于监督微调，能够更好地将模型行为与任务特定奖励对齐。在GeoRef上训练的模型在下游几何推理任务中表现出可测量的改进。

Conclusion: 即使最先进的多模态大语言模型在该任务上也表现不佳，表明需要显式评估和加强几何基础能力作为稳健几何问题求解的前提条件。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法在扩展数学问题生成方面面临高计算成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限的挑战，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题，训练专门的难题生成器DiffGen-8B，基于过滤后的困难数据生成新难题。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct，性能提升11.3%，在多个数学竞赛基准上达到65.9%平均准确率，超越OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能够有效转移高级推理能力，无需依赖更大更昂贵的教师模型，且随着难题数量增加，模型在困难基准上的性能呈现明显的扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

Motivation: 标准匿名图神经网络在整数线性规划问题上表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符方法又容易引入虚假相关性，影响泛化性能。

Method: 提出了基于d跳唯一性着色的局部UID方案，确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一。基于此方案开发了ColorGNN和ColorUID两种变体。

Result: 在三个ILP基准测试上取得显著提升，在线性规划数据集上表现出强大的OOD泛化能力，并能进一步提升最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 局部UID方案在保持全局UID表达力的同时提供了更强的泛化能力，为ILP优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

Motivation: 现有的MLA解码内核使用absorb方法虽然减少了HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性阻碍了注意力计算中数据复用机会（如共享前缀）的性能优势

Method: 提出TyphoonMLA混合方法，对注意力计算的计算密集型部分应用naive公式以利用共享前缀，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求

Result: 在NPU和GPU上分别实现了3倍和3.24倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升，HBM大小仅增加3%的开销

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA成功结合了两种方法的优势，为MLA架构提供了高效的注意力计算解决方案

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

Motivation: 图学习中的核心挑战是理解模型如何泛化到未见过的图。现有基准仅限于单图传导式设置，无法评估归纳泛化能力。

Method: 通过生成具有持久语义社区的图，确保概念一致性同时控制结构属性（如同质性和度分布），实现可控分布偏移的鲁棒性测试。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解空中交通流至关重要，但面临建模个体飞机行为和复杂交互的困难，同时需要生成可解释的预测结果。

Method: MAIFormer框架包含两个关键注意力模块：掩码多变量注意力（捕捉个体飞机的时空模式）和智能体注意力（建模复杂空中交通场景中的多智能体社交模式）。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中耗时较长，需要大量交互步骤来学习最优Q函数。现有的视觉语言动作策略在低层控制方面性能有限，且需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。建议的动作增加了样本多样性。

Result: 在不同环境和代理设置下的评估结果显示，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在现实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAVA是一种后处理模型无关方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的局部嵌入结构，通过分析输入特征与潜在空间组织的关系来揭示特征关联模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型难以解释，特别是当输出是多维潜在嵌入而非明确目标时。现有的解释方法要么过于细粒度要么过于简化，无法有效揭示潜在空间的组织结构。

Method: LAVA将潜在空间表示为一系列局部邻域，通过分析原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 基于MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入，LAVA能够捕获相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习的潜在空间结构，有助于科学发现和理解复杂数据的内在组织。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

### [84] [GRPO is Secretly a Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21154)
*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了GRPO强化学习算法在特定假设下会诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型（PRM），并通过实证验证了这些假设在现实条件下成立。作者发现GRPO目标存在缺陷，提出了λ-GRPO改进算法，在提升模型性能的同时大幅降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GRPO算法依赖昂贵且显式定义的过程奖励模型，作者希望探索是否可以利用GRPO算法本身隐藏的PRM结构来提升性能并降低成本。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO会诱导PRM，然后实证验证假设成立。基于GRPO-as-a-PRM框架识别算法缺陷，提出λ-GRPO改进算法来缓解过程步骤分布不均的问题。

Result: λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上表现优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快。改进算法对训练时间和成本影响极小。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用GRPO算法内置的隐藏PRM结构来提升模型性能，这质疑了使用昂贵显式PRM的必要性。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

*Tian Lan,Hao Duong Le,Jinbo Li,Wenjun He,Meng Wang,Chenghao Liu,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeRCD是一个基于相对上下文差异（RCD）预训练范式的时间序列异常检测基础模型，通过检测相邻时间窗口间的显著差异来识别异常，在零样本场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于重构的时间序列异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常且容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出Relative Context Discrepancy（RCD）预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口间的上下文差异来识别异常，而非学习重构输入。使用标准Transformer架构，并构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时间序列异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式为构建稳健且可泛化的时间序列异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DELTA-Code是一个用于评估LLM在算法编码任务中学习能力和迁移能力的基准测试，通过合成编码问题家族来探究LLM是否能够通过强化学习获得新的推理策略并迁移到分布外测试集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM是否能够获得或泛化真正新的推理策略这一开放性问题，而不仅仅是依赖预训练或后训练中编码的已有技能。

Method: 使用DELTA-Code基准测试，通过模板化问题生成器隔离推理技能，引入完全分布外的问题家族，探索关键训练要素如分阶段热身、经验回放、课程训练和验证循环。

Result: 实验发现明显的顿悟相变现象：经过长期接近零奖励后，RL训练模型突然达到近乎完美的准确率。在家族内部和重组技能方面有显著提升，但在转换性案例中存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA为探索RL驱动推理的极限提供了一个清晰的测试平台，有助于理解模型如何超越现有先验知识来获取新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

TL;DR: 提出了基于树搜索的分组智能体强化学习方法Tree-GRPO，通过树结构轨迹解决长期多轮智能体任务中稀疏监督信号的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仅依赖结果奖励的方法在长期多轮智能体任务中存在稀疏监督问题，需要更有效的监督信号。

Method: Tree-GRPO方法将每个树节点表示为完整的智能体交互步骤，通过共享公共前缀增加固定预算内的rollout数量，并利用树结构轨迹构建步骤级过程监督信号。

Result: 在11个数据集和3类QA任务上的实验表明，基于树的强化学习方法优于基于链的方法。

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树搜索和分组相对优势估计，有效解决了长期智能体任务中的稀疏监督问题，理论分析表明其与步骤级直接偏好学习等价。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于知识图谱反事实解释的框架，用于解释经过LoRA微调的大语言模型的结构推理和语义行为变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LoRA微调机制如何改变大语言模型的结构推理和语义行为是一个开放挑战，需要开发新的解释方法。

Method: 构建BioToolKG生物信息学工具知识图谱，设计CFFTLLMExplainer框架，通过学习图节点和边的软掩码来生成最小结构扰动，同时优化结构稀疏性和语义差异。

Result: 应用于微调的LLaMA模型，反事实掩码揭示了模型的结构依赖性，并与LoRA诱导的参数变化相一致。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解微调大语言模型的内部机制提供了新见解，反事实图谱有望成为可解释AI的潜在工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

*Donghyeon Ki,Hee-Jun Ahn,Kyungyoon Kim,Byung-Jun Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACA是一种轻量级强化学习框架，通过消除显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，简化了actor-critic方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统actor-critic方法依赖分离的actor和critic网络，训练复杂且对架构决策和超参数调优敏感，限制了在大规模函数逼近器中的可扩展性。扩散模型虽然能表达多模态行为但引入额外设计选择和计算负担。

Method: ACA框架消除了显式actor网络，直接从噪声级critic的梯度场生成动作，保持策略改进与critic最新价值估计紧密对齐，同时避免actor训练的计算开销。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和最先进的扩散方法实现了更有利的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA为在线RL提供了一个简单而强大的解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达能力，无需依赖基于扩散的actor即可捕获多样化的多模态行为。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

TL;DR: AirPCM是一个新颖的深度时空预测模型，通过整合多区域多污染物动态与显式气象-污染物因果关系建模，实现准确可扩展的空气污染预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球性紧迫问题，现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，无法有效处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性。

Method: 采用统一架构联合捕捉跨站点空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，支持细粒度可解释的多污染物预测。

Result: 在多尺度真实数据集上的广泛评估表明，AirPCM在预测准确性和泛化能力方面持续超越最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供可操作的见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持。

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出FORCE方法，通过消除对层特征和频谱特征的过度依赖，改善视觉越狱攻击的跨模型可迁移性，从而更有效地评估闭源MLLMs的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉越狱攻击虽然能轻易操纵开源MLLMs，但跨模型可迁移性极差，无法可靠识别闭源MLLMs的漏洞。研究发现这些攻击位于高锐度区域，对参数变化敏感。

Method: 提出FORCE方法：分析攻击在损失景观中的特征表示，引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新调整频率特征的影响，消除对特定层和频谱特征的过度依赖。

Result: 实验表明FORCE方法能有效提升视觉越狱攻击的跨模型可迁移性，为闭源MLLMs的红队评估提供了有效工具。

Conclusion: 通过消除对非泛化特征的过度依赖，FORCE方法发现了更平坦的可行区域，显著改善了视觉越狱攻击的跨模型性能，为MLLMs安全评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，显著提升语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法如PPO和GRPO依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。需要一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留梯度信号的方法。

Method: 提出PSPO方法，在计算重要性比率前将当前策略的概率向旧策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。将PSPO实例化到GRPO中形成GR-PSPO，并在Qwen2.5模型上进行微调。

Result: 在GSM8K、SVAMP、ASDiv和MATH-500等数学推理数据集上测试，GR-PSPO相比裁剪版GRPO性能大幅提升：0.5B模型从17.6%提升到39.7%，1.5B模型从37.8%提升到59.4%。

Conclusion: PSPO通过概率平滑有效替代比率裁剪，既保持了训练稳定性又提升了模型性能，生成的推理过程更清晰、简洁和逻辑性强。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

TL;DR: 该论文分析了神经网络训练数据重建攻击的局限性，证明了在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解，重建本质上不可靠。实证表明训练样本的精确复制仅是偶然现象，且训练更充分的网络实际上更不容易受到重建攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了隐私和安全担忧，现有重建攻击方法缺乏坚实的理论基础，攻击可靠性理解不足。本文旨在分析现有重建方法的固有弱点和局限性。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法。理论上严格证明在没有数据先验知识时重建的不可靠性；实证上验证训练样本精确复制的偶然性，并测试不同训练程度网络的抗攻击能力。

Result: 理论证明存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解；实证显示精确复制训练样本仅是偶然；发现训练更充分的网络（满足隐式偏差条件更强）反而更不容易受到重建攻击。

Conclusion: 重建攻击在缺乏先验知识时本质上不可靠，训练更充分的网络具有更好的隐私保护能力，这为在保证强泛化能力的同时缓解重建攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

Conclusion: SATMC通过同时考虑结构和属性转换，有效解决了图域自适应中的结构异质性问题，在跨网络节点分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自演化的认知代理框架，用于检测垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击。它构建统一的异构图，结合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源，通过认知图神经网络和LLM进行上下文推理，并采用红蓝对抗自演化机制持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单和简单启发式方法，采用多模态策略并快速适应以绕过过滤器。传统检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应，导致性能迅速下降。

Method: 构建统一的异构邮件图，融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用认知图神经网络和LLM进行上下文感知推理；采用红蓝对抗自演化循环，红队生成新规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集和合成对抗变体上的广泛实验表明，EvoMail在检测准确性、对演化垃圾邮件策略的适应性以及推理可解释性方面均优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)作为对抗性攻击的防御机制，通过理论分析和实验验证表明SPCA比标准PCA在保持准确性的同时具有更好的鲁棒性。


<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现优异但容易受到精心设计的对抗性扰动攻击。本文重新审视线性降维作为一种简单、数据自适应的防御方法。

Method: 实证比较标准PCA与其稀疏变体SPCA作为前端特征提取器，结合理论分析。理论方面推导了SPCA特征的线性分类器的精确鲁棒性证明，并通过Lipschitz组合论证说明稀疏性降低算子范数界限。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA表现更稳健，同时保持竞争力的清洁准确率。稀疏投影减少了对抗性杠杆效应。

Conclusion: 理论识别了稀疏投影减少对抗性杠杆的机制，实验验证了这种优势在线性设置之外仍然存在。SPCA是一种有效的对抗性防御方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，通过多模态标记化策略解决传统LLM在CAD序列处理中的语义丢失问题，实现文本引导的CAD原型设计和编辑的统一流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM标记器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD的原始级语义，阻碍了几何结构建模。需要一种与CAD原始和结构特性对齐的多模态标记化策略。

Method: 提出CAD-Tokenizer框架，使用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码，生成紧凑、原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: 在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中，CAD-Tokenizer显著改善了指令遵循和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上都优于通用LLM和任务特定基线。

Conclusion: CAD-Tokenizer通过多模态标记化策略有效解决了CAD序列表示问题，为文本引导的CAD设计流程提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DATS（Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling）的新方法，用于解决持续学习中的校准问题，通过距离感知的温度缩放来适应不同任务，减少校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，现有方法主要从数据角度进行校准，使用单一温度参数，忽略了任务间的差异，导致不同任务的校准误差波动较大。本文旨在开发一种更原则性的方法，根据与当前任务的距离自适应调整温度。

Method: 提出DATS方法，结合基于原型的距离估计和距离感知校准，在没有先验任务信息的情况下推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DATS方法在减少跨任务校准误差方面比现有方法更稳定、可靠和一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放有效解决了持续学习中的校准问题，提高了模型在不同任务上的校准性能。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: MoT是一种在异构专家模型之间进行潜在层协作的新方法，通过轻量级路由器和交互层实现单次推理，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型日益专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交互聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性

Method: 使用轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家，在共享潜在空间中通过交互层让主专家对活跃同行进行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，只训练路由器和交互层

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT分别比当前最先进的Avengers方法提升0.38%和2.92%，显著优于单个最佳模型，且推理时间与路由基线相当

Conclusion: MoT为组合异构大语言模型提供了简单的潜在空间机制，是实现更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差（MSE），但这种方法只是f-散度的一个特例。作者希望建立一个更通用的框架，允许使用任何f-散度来实现更好的遗忘效果。

Method: 提出了基于f-散度的统一遗忘框架，分析不同f-散度对算法收敛性和遗忘质量的影响，允许根据具体应用选择最优的散度度量。

Result: 该框架提供了比传统MSE方法更灵活的范式，能够在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好的平衡。

Conclusion: f-散度框架为扩散模型遗忘提供了更通用的解决方案，用户可以根据具体需求选择最适合的散度度量来优化遗忘效果。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆强化学习方法，将最大熵IRL简化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类估计行为策略，以及迭代回归求解固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最大熵IRL方法涉及复杂的内部优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，限制了现代高表达能力函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。

Method: 通过分析发现，种群最大似然解可由涉及行为策略的线性固定点方程表征，从而将IRL简化为概率分类和迭代回归两个监督学习任务。

Result: 该方法简单模块化，适用于各种函数逼近类，实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为IRL提供了一种更简单有效的实现途径，便于使用现代函数逼近器，并具有理论保证。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

TL;DR: 本文研究了过参数化线性回归中最小ℓ_p插值器的参数范数缩放规律，发现了一个数据相关的转换点（elbow）和通用阈值r_*=2(p-1)，并证明对角线性网络继承了相同的规律。


<details>

Motivation: 理解过参数化线性回归中不同ℓ_r范数的缩放行为对于理解泛化性能至关重要，因为许多泛化代理指标都依赖于参数范数。

Method: 采用对偶射线分析，揭示了X⊤Y中信号尖峰与零坐标块之间的竞争关系，得到了封闭形式的预测。同时通过校准对角线性网络的初始化尺度到有效p值来验证理论。

Result: 发现了一个数据依赖的转换点n_*和通用阈值r_*=2(p-1)，该阈值区分了饱和的范数和继续增长的范数。对角线性网络实验验证了相同的规律。

Conclusion: 该统一解揭示了ℓ_p偏置插值下所有ℓ_r范数的缩放规律，表明泛化代理指标的预测能力对所使用的ℓ_r范数敏感。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

Conclusion: DINO为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新的基准，展示了基于物理的分解方法在提高稳定性和鲁棒性方面的优势。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in

TL;DR: 本文提出了联邦流匹配（FFM）框架，用于在隐私约束下训练流匹配模型，解决了分布式数据无法集中训练生成模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在不进行中心化聚合的情况下直接从分布式数据本地训练生成模型。

Method: 提出了三种方法：FFM-vanilla（客户端使用独立源和目标耦合进行本地训练）、FFM-LOT（使用局部最优传输耦合提高客户端内流直线性）和FFM-GOT（基于最优传输半对偶公式的联邦策略，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端间耦合）。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在保护隐私的同时提高联邦设置下的流直线性和样本质量，性能可与集中式基线相媲美。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功解决了分布式数据环境下的隐私保护生成模型训练问题，通过不同的联邦策略在保持隐私的同时实现了良好的模型性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

Motivation: Superchip采用GPU和CPU紧密耦合的异构架构，但现有研究尚未充分探索LLM训练如何从这种新架构中受益，需要重新审视传统卸载方案的假设。

Method: SuperOffload系统结合自适应权重卸载、桶化重新分区、Superchip感知类型转换、推测执行等技术，并针对Grace CPU优化Adam优化器，充分利用Hopper GPU、Grace CPU和NVLink-C2C互连。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上评估显示，相比最先进的卸载系统，吞吐量提升达2.5倍，单Superchip可训练25B模型，8个GH200可训练13B模型（序列长度达100万token）并实现55% MFU。

Conclusion: SuperOffload证明了Superchip架构在LLM训练中的巨大潜力，通过专门优化的卸载策略可以显著提升训练效率和模型规模支持能力。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

### [112] [Optimal Robust Recourse with $L^p$-Bounded Model Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21293)
*Phone Kyaw,Kshitij Kayastha,Shahin Jabbari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，使用L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）来定义模型变化，相比之前使用L^∞范数的方法，能显著降低追索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法使用L^∞范数会导致追索解决方案成本过高，需要更约束的模型变化定义来降低追索价格。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，在L^p范数约束下为广义线性模型提供可证明的最优鲁棒追索计算，解决了非凸优化问题。

Result: 实证研究表明，该算法在线性和非线性模型上都显著降低了追索成本（可达几个数量级），在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡，且提供更稀疏的追索方案。

Conclusion: 该方法相比现有工作具有更低的追索成本和更好的稀疏性，同时对保证可行性的后处理方法保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合微调和领域自适应的迁移学习方法，通过引入领域分类器进行对抗训练，提取领域不变特征，提升目标域波束预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于迁移学习的波束预测方法主要依赖简单微调，当源域和目标域数据分布差异较大时，简单微调会限制模型在目标域的性能。

Method: 在预训练模型微调过程中集成领域分类器，通过对抗训练提取领域不变特征，增强模型在目标域的适应性。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提方法在目标域的可达速率性能优于纯微调方法，且接近在目标域从头开始训练的性能。

Conclusion: 结合领域自适应的迁移学习方法能有效解决跨域波束预测问题，在数据分布差异大的场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Existing transfer learning-based beam prediction approaches primarily rely on
simple fine-tuning. When there is a significant difference in data distribution
between the target domain and the source domain, simple fine-tuning limits the
model's performance in the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a
transfer learning-based beam prediction method that combines fine-tuning with
domain adaptation. We integrate a domain classifier into fine-tuning the
pre-trained model. The model extracts domain-invariant features in adversarial
training with domain classifier, which can enhance model performance in the
target domain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed transfer
learning-based beam prediction method achieves better achievable rate
performance than the pure fine-tuning method in the target domain, and close to
those when the training is done from scratch on the target domain.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习(ICL)已成为自然语言处理和大型语言模型应用的重要范式，但其理论机制理解有限，需要深入研究。

Method: 提出CB-ICL的理论分析框架，量化LLM从提示中可利用的知识，建立演示样本与查询输入的相似度度量，并探讨演示规模和嵌入维度的影响。

Result: 理论分析解释了CB-ICL在少量演示下表现良好的原因，并通过真实数据实验验证了CB-ICL及其理论的实用性。

Conclusion: CB-ICL理论为理解ICL机制提供了重要见解，对模型预训练和提示工程具有指导意义，并揭示了演示规模和嵌入维度在ICL中的作用。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

TL;DR: 该论文针对具有两个校验节点和子分组大小为2的MDS码，推导了单节点故障修复带宽和I/O开销的下界，并提出了达到这些下界的显式构造。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSR码通常需要指数级大的子分组大小，导致显著的磁盘I/O开销。虽然已有研究探索了子分组大小与修复带宽之间的权衡，但对于固定子分组大小的MDS码的最小修复带宽这一基本问题仍未解决。

Method: 针对n-k=2且ℓ=2的情况，推导了修复带宽和I/O开销的紧下界，并提出了两种显式的MDS阵列码构造，分别达到这些下界。

Result: 获得了单节点故障修复带宽和I/O开销的紧下界，并提供了具有可证明修复效率的实际代码设计。

Conclusion: 该研究解决了固定子分组大小下MDS码修复带宽优化的重要理论问题，为分布式存储系统提供了更实用的编码方案。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage
systems as they provide optimal fault tolerance for a given amount of storage
overhead.
  The seminal work of Dimakis~\emph{et al.} first established a lower bound on
the repair bandwidth for a single failed node of MDS codes, known as the
\emph{cut-set bound}. MDS codes that achieve this bound are called minimum
storage regenerating (MSR) codes. Numerous constructions and theoretical
analyses of MSR codes reveal that they typically require exponentially large
sub-packetization levels, leading to significant disk I/O overhead. To mitigate
this issue, many studies explore the trade-offs between the sub-packetization
level and repair bandwidth, achieving reduced sub-packetization at the cost of
suboptimal repair bandwidth. Despite these advances, the fundamental question
of determining the minimum repair bandwidth for a single failure of MDS codes
with fixed sub-packetization remains open.
  In this paper, we address this challenge for the case of two parity nodes
($n-k=2$) and sub-packetization $\ell=2$. We derive tight lower bounds on both
the minimum repair bandwidth and the minimum I/O overhead. Furthermore, we
present two explicit MDS array code constructions that achieve these bounds,
respectively, offering practical code designs with provable repair efficiency.

Motivation: 边缘设备在传输高容量AI任务数据时面临带宽限制导致的显著延迟，而降低数据质量又会影响推理精度，需要平衡这种精度-延迟权衡。

Method: LAB框架包含：1）基于DNN的actor网络处理离散降级决策的组合复杂性；2）基于贝叶斯优化的critic网络构建高斯过程代理模型评估动作；3）通过凸优化进行最优带宽分配。

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的数值评估显示，LAB实现了接近最优的精度-延迟权衡，相比穷举搜索仅产生1.22%的精度下降和0.07秒的额外延迟。

Conclusion: LAB框架有效解决了边缘智能中的黑盒混合整数非线性规划问题，为精度-延迟权衡提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to
offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge
servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task
data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs
significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading
data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p),
it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency
tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of
closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships.
Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation
decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity.
Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box}
mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we
propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB
employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation
actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b)
a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process
surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of
degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is
then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on
real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal
accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and
0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) is regarded as a key enabler for next-generation wireless systems.
However, conventional fixed antenna arrays limit the ability of UAVs to fully
exploit their inherent potential. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
UAV-enabled ISAC framework equipped with fluid antenna (FA) arrays, where the
mobility of antenna elements introduces additional spatial degrees of freedom
to simultaneously enhance communication and sensing performance. A
multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize the
communication rates of multiple users while minimizing the Cram\'er-Rao bound
(CRB) for single-target angle estimation. Due to excessively frequent updates
of FA positions may lead to response delays, a three-timescale optimization
framework is developed to jointly design transmit beamforming, FA positions,
and UAV trajectory based on their characteristics. To solve the non-convexity
of the problem, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is developed to
obtain a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme
significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, validating the
effectiveness of integrating the FA technology into the UAV-enabled ISAC
systems.

Conclusion: RMC-SC码提供了一种有效的自适应编码解决方案，能够满足不同系统需求，同时在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they
offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components,
the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In
the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed.
For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions
and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger
codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables
switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while
reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable
SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design
probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is
achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes
memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of
short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability
distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown
distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the
gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of
cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to
design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other
cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC
codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts
and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a
literature-based straightforward scheme.

Conclusion: PUSNEC系统为实现全球范围内安全可靠的多播通信提供了一种实用方法，通过定量分析保密性与可靠性之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Multicast for securely sharing confidential data among many users is becoming
increasingly important. Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing
and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these
approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure
long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic
security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD),
physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to
enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted
nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows.
Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to
address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This
system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid
onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We
derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the
probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in
multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of
the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving
secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.

Abstract: The shotgun sequencing process involves fragmenting a long DNA sequence
(input string) into numerous shorter, unordered, and overlapping segments
(referred to as \emph{reads}). The reads are sequenced, and later aligned to
reconstruct the original string. Viewing the sequencing process as the
read-phase of a DNA storage system, the information-theoretic capacity of
noise-free shotgun sequencing has been characterized in literature. Motivated
by the base-wise quality scores available in practical sequencers, a recent
work considered the \emph{shotgun sequencing channel with erasures}, in which
the symbols in the reads are assumed to contain random erasures. Achievable
rates for this channel were identified. In the present work, we obtain a
converse for this channel. The arguments for the proof involve a careful
analysis of a genie-aided decoder, which knows the correct locations of the
reads. The converse is not tight in general. However, it meets the
achievability result asymptotically in some channel parameters.

Motivation: 研究大规模MIMO随机接入网络的容量极限，特别关注用户随机活动和干扰衰减特性对网络容量的影响。

Method: 采用随机编码论证，假设所有用户使用相同分布的码本，分析非相干MIMO衰落信道模型，推导严格的容量界限。

Result: 当干扰衰落系数以指数或更慢速度衰减时，容量受限于发射功率；当衰减速度快于双指数时，容量可随功率无限增长。

Conclusion: 证实了干扰受限网络中的饱和现象无法通过随机用户活动或超越尺度族的信道输入来避免，但在快速衰减干扰下可实现无界容量。

Abstract: This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks,
modeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells.
To characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument
is invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their
codebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a
generalization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in
the literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the
transmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading
coefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed
that the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,
rigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds
depends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering
cells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the
interferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay
exponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit
power. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited
networks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews ("Fundamental limits of
cooperation", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by
random user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In
contrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,
then the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded
capacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since
the condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents
interference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple
access. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating
interference as noise.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了无点合成情况下的半空间学习问题，提出了一种基于有限法向量集的算法，实现了Θ(D + log n)的紧界查询复杂度，并扩展到PAC学习场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点定位问题中，Hopkins等人提出了近乎最优的O(d log n)查询算法，但需要点合成能力。Dasgupta证明若无此能力则存在Ω(n)查询下界。本文旨在设计无需点合成的高效半空间学习算法。

Method: 通过限制法向量来自大小为D的集合，利用提供的排序结构进行并行二分搜索，而非顺序处理每个排序。该方法可推广到在至少一个提供排序下单调的布尔函数学习。

Result: 获得了Θ(D + log n)的紧界查询复杂度，特别地对于轴对齐半空间实现了最优O(d + log n)查询确定性学习器。在PAC学习场景下，即使存在对抗性噪声，也能以O(min(D + log(1/ε), 1/ε) · log D)查询学习到误差ε的函数。

Conclusion: 本文通过利用排序结构进行并行二分搜索，突破了无点合成情况下的查询下界，为半空间学习提供了高效算法，该方法具有更广泛的适用性。

Abstract: In the classic point location problem, one is given an arbitrary dataset $X
\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points with query access to an unknown halfspace
$f : \mathbb{R}^d \to \{0,1\}$, and the goal is to learn the label of every
point in $X$. This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal
$\widetilde{O}(d \log n)$ query algorithm is known due to
Hopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted
the power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in
fact without this power there is an $\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to
Dasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).
  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning
halfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound,
we consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size
$D$, and show tight bounds of $\Theta(D + \log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain
an optimal $O(d + \log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned
halfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \log n)$ vs. $\Omega(d + \log n)$.
In fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean
function $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$
provided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these
orderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each
ordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.
  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal
algorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\min(D + \log(1/\varepsilon),
1/\varepsilon) \cdot \log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error
$\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a
$c\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$. This
bound is optimal up to a $\log D$ factor, including in the realizable setting.

### [123] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI智能体行为的时间表达式语言，能够系统性地检测基于LLM的智能体系统中的错误，特别针对由于随机生成过程导致的输出变化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法在面对LLM自然语言输出的变异性时显得脆弱，需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出、专注于智能体行为序列的验证方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，通过监控智能体的工具调用和状态转换轨迹，使用时间表达式语言来捕获正确的行为模式，实现对系统行为的验证。

Result: 在三智能体系统测试中，当使用大型模型时所有时间断言都得到满足，但使用较小模型时出现行为违规，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败，时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI智能体可靠性提供了基础，特别适用于关键应用中部署的智能体系统的行为回归检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LATTS方法通过局部自适应测试时缩放，根据生成步骤的难度动态调整计算资源分配，相比传统验证器方法实现了更优的准确率-计算效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证器方法在测试时对所有样本和生成步骤均匀增加计算量，不考虑个体实例的复杂性，导致计算资源使用效率低下。

Method: 提出LATTS方法，在每个生成步骤使用验证器接受准则来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型得出的局部难度概念动态调整每步计算量。

Result: 实验结果表明LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算效率权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过局部自适应计算分配有效解决了测试时缩放中的计算效率问题，为LLM下游任务性能优化提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

comparing its output to a general-purpose LLM. The results demonstrate that
InsightGUIDE produces more structured and actionable guidance, serving as a

### [127] [Reconstruction-Based Adaptive Scheduling Using AI Inferences in Safety-Critical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20513)
*Samer Alshaer,Ala Khalifeh,Roman Obermaisser*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的重构框架，用于动态验证和组装时间触发系统的调度方案，解决消息碰撞、优先级处理错误等问题，确保系统安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间触发系统在动态运行环境中面临消息碰撞、优先级处理导致的死循环、以及不完整或无效调度等挑战，这些都会影响系统安全性和性能。

Method: 提出重构框架，通过系统化地将AI生成或启发式得到的调度优先级转换为完全可执行的调度方案，包含安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制来处理意外事件。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了系统适应性、操作完整性和运行时性能，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，支持在高度动态和不确定条件下的可靠实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练方法在构建涵盖所有可能场景的多调度图时面临资源密集和不可行的问题，特别是在考虑硬件故障、松弛变化等上下文事件时。

Method: 在元调度器中集成自适应在线学习单元，采用强化学习模型持续探索和发现新的调度解决方案，动态扩展MSG并优化现有调度器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态适应机制使系统能够更好地满足不断变化的需求，确保大规模安全关键环境中的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假肢通常使用肌电信号进行模式识别控制，但肌电信号容易受到污染，这会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。需要开发能够检测和减轻污染影响的方法。

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实肌电信号进行了实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了比较分析，并与文献中的类似系统进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测和减轻肌电信号污染对假肢控制识别质量的不利影响。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习对于构建自我改进的LLM代理至关重要。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat

framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归（AR）和非自回归（NAR）语言模型的新框架，通过NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，再由AR模型生成精确最终答案，在推理任务中实现了26%的性能提升并显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型虽然能生成连贯输出但推理速度慢，特别是在数学和代码等需要长推理链的领域；NAR模型虽然能并行生成但输出质量较低。需要结合两者的优势来解决推理任务中的效率和质量问题。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）高效生成中间推理轨迹，然后利用AR模型基于这些中间结果生成精确的最终答案，形成AR-NAR协同推理框架。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线实现了26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR协同框架有效结合了两种模型的优势，在保持高质量输出的同时大幅提升推理效率，为复杂推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory通过有效的记忆检索和整合机制，赋予机器人强大而准确的空间推理能力，为解决复杂环境中的空间查询问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个粗到细的推理增强框架，通过专家思维建模和步骤细化来提升LLM在日志分析任务中的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用LLM在日志分析任务中难以构建符合专家认知的结构化推理流程，且缺乏精确的推理步骤细节

Method: 两阶段框架：1）粗粒度专家思维增强，从故障排除流程图构建高层思维；2）细粒度步骤增强，通过任务特定解决方案微调LLM，并使用偏好学习校准推理细节

Result: 在四个不同日志分析任务上的实验表明，LogReasoner显著优于现有LLM，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeFacto是一个反事实推理框架，通过三种互补的训练范式（正例、反事实、随机掩码）来联合提升多模态语言模型的答案准确性和推理忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态语言模型在视觉语言推理中可能依赖无关或虚假区域得出正确答案，表明模型并未真正理解图像内容，推理忠实性存在严重问题。

Method: 提出DeFacto框架，包含三个训练范式：正例训练、反事实训练和随机掩码训练。通过自动定位问题相关证据并构建三种变体数据集（约10万张图像），使用基于GRPO的强化学习训练模型，设计三种互补奖励函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，DeFacto显著提高了答案准确性和推理忠实性，为可解释的多模态推理奠定了更强基础。

Conclusion: DeFacto通过反事实推理框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GALAX框架通过图增强语言模型整合多组学数据、拓扑结构和文本知识，用于精准医学中的可解释性靶点和通路发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只能部分利用多组学特征、拓扑背景和文本知识，限制了机制解释性。需要整合定量多组学信号、拓扑结构和文献规模文本，通过子图推理桥接数值证据、拓扑知识和语言背景。

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，以强化学习方式逐步生成疾病相关子图，由LLM初始化并由GNN迭代评估。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学图谱和生物医学图知识，支持长上下文推理和可扩展的生物基础框架。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展、生物基础的可解释性框架，通过强化引导的子图推理实现精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的移动应用评论分析框架，解决传统星级评分系统无法捕捉文本评论细微反馈的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术难以解释上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等微妙语言特征

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型结合结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取特征级洞察，支持通过检索增强对话问答进行交互式评论探索

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性洞察

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效解决传统评论分析的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和深入的解决方案

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

*Xiaozhuang Song,Xuanhao Pan,Xinjian Zhao,Hangting Ye,Shufei Zhang,Jian Tang,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AOT*是一个将大型语言模型生成的化学合成路径与系统性的AND-OR树搜索相结合的反合成规划框架，显著提高了搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步反合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和高推理成本的计算挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制。

Method: AOT*通过将LLM生成的完整合成路径原子化映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航。

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用比现有LLM方法少3-5倍的迭代次数达到竞争性的解决率，在复杂分子目标上效率优势更加明显。

Conclusion: AOT*框架成功解决了反合成规划中的效率瓶颈，为药物发现和材料设计等领域的合成路线发现提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于确定性有限自动机(DFA)的框架来评估AI代理通过函数调用序列解决现实世界任务的表现，并引入了CORE评估套件，包含五个指标来量化代理行为与预期执行模式的匹配程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理基准测试通常将评估简化为对最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，构建CORE评估套件包含路径正确性、路径正确性-Kendall's tau复合指标、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 基于DFA的框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理的行为进行原则性评估，提供比传统方法更全面和细致的性能分析。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成的复杂问题挑战模型的信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或使用人工构造的上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献中的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文评估。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习带来的改进有限，模型在基础数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长科学文档推理方面的局限性，为开发更强大的长上下文推理模型提供了重要基准和诊断工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体决策过程在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确性的同时优化延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱问答系统在静态扩展和长思考提示方法中存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器和上下文策展人），使用LC-MAPPO算法在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估AI系统创造性能力的新框架，重点关注大语言模型在科学创意生成中的表现，发现了模型深度和宽度对创造力的最优配置，以及新颖性与实用性之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念框架无法充分评估AI系统特别是大语言模型在创造性任务中的表现，因为组合创造力是一种开放式的能力，不能简单地用准确性或正确性来衡量。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架和算法任务，通过评估输出的新颖性和实用性程度来衡量创造性能力，并进行了多项实证研究。

Result: 发现了创造力的缩放行为规律，确定了固定计算预算下模型深度和宽度的最优配置，揭示了新颖性与实用性之间的基本权衡关系，这种权衡即使在规模扩大时仍然存在。

Conclusion: 当前形式的大语言模型在长期创造性潜力上存在局限性，研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力提供了基础，标志着泛化能力的新前沿。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

Motivation: 理解多智能体系统中LLMs和LRMs之间的说服动态，挑战模型规模决定说服效能的假设，探索认知过程对说服行为的影响。

Method: 通过多智能体说服实验，分析不同模型的抵抗力和说服力，考察推理透明度的影响，并研究多跳说服网络中的影响传播动态。

Result: 发现推理模型对说服更具抵抗力，但分享推理内容能显著增强其说服能力；多跳说服呈现复杂的影响传播和衰减模式。

Conclusion: 模型的内部处理架构与其外部说服行为存在系统性联系，这对未来多智能体系统的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Conclusion: Recon-Act框架通过侦察-行动范式有效解决了多轮网页任务中的动作序列问题，建立了自我进化的闭环系统，为智能浏览器使用智能体提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估器的框架存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递不一致，这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息损失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望值；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致性降低8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM作为评估器框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论见解和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均能实现一致改进，无需额外训练或人工标注。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在利用链式思维数据时缺乏选择性，不清楚哪些数据类型最能有效增强模型的推理能力。需要一种更智能的数据选择策略来最大化推理模型的潜力。

Method: 首先定义推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数，然后从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式，构建富含高价值推理模式的核心参考集。提出双粒度算法（推理模式链和标记熵）从数据池中高效选择与核心集对齐的高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿标记的CoTP数据，就能使850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升9.58%，并将下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性使用富含高价值推理模式的CoT数据，可以显著提升大型推理模型的数学推理能力，证明数据质量比数量更重要。

substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析框架来量化推理路径，研究强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)如何塑造大语言模型的推理能力，发现RL压缩错误轨迹而SFT扩展正确轨迹，RL集中推理功能而SFT均匀分布推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解RL和SFT如何具体影响大语言模型的推理过程，超越仅基于准确率的分析，深入探究推理路径的质变。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级（完整推理输出）和步骤级（推理图节点）两个粒度分析推理过程，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL使错误轨迹压缩约2.5倍，SFT使正确轨迹扩展；RL集中推理功能到少数步骤，SFT均匀分布推理功能；两阶段训练（SFT后接RL）的成功源于互补效应。

Conclusion: 该分析框架解释了当前最佳实践（SFT后接RL）的成功原因，为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实际指导，揭示了RL和SFT在塑造推理能力中的互补作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToMPO算法，通过推理他人策略、多层级优势估计和平衡全局局部奖励，显著提升LLM在战略决策中的表现，相比GRPO算法提升35%，甚至优于参数大100倍的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽略了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性，且当前强化学习方法难以在训练中考虑他人策略。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法：1）基于推理他人策略生成rollouts；2）在图级和样本级进行优势估计；3）平衡全局和局部奖励。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果上提升35%，与参数大100倍的模型相比提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型的战略决策能力，证明了其在复杂决策场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和动作执行视为独立任务，忽略了镜像神经元机制揭示的二者之间的内在联系。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习最大化对应表示之间的互信息来实现对齐。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的协同效应，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以模拟镜像神经元机制，实现动作理解和动作执行任务的统一建模。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大型语言模型通过分布式专业化机制处理罕见词汇，而非模块化架构。识别出三种不同的神经元组织原则，揭示了罕见词汇处理的内部工作机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理专业领域中的罕见词汇时存在困难，需要了解其内部是否通过离散模块化架构或分布式参数级分化来发展专业化机制。

Method: 通过系统分析多个模型家族中最终层MLP神经元，研究罕见词汇处理的内部机制，包括神经元影响层次、激活模式和训练动态分析。

Result: 发现罕见词汇处理通过分布式专业化实现：功能协调但空间分布的子网络，具有三个组织原则：三区域影响层次、协调激活模式、标准注意力通路可访问性。训练动态显示功能专业化通过参数分化逐渐出现。

Conclusion: LLMs通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非混合专家式模块化来处理罕见词汇，这为可解释模型编辑、计算效率优化和理解transformer网络中的功能组织提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM在单次推理中处理多跳问答任务时面临的能力瓶颈，提出了一个理论性能上限，并开发了一个多调用框架InfoQA来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答任务需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLM的有限输出容量使得单次推理范式在面对复杂任务时容易崩溃。

Method: 提出了一个基于Fano风格精度上界的理论分析，并开发了InfoQA框架，该框架通过能力感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前推理痕迹来保持信息负载在单次限制内。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的能力曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了任务复杂性超过模型容量时精度必然崩溃的规律。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM代理在没有外部任务约束时的自主行为，为预测任务模糊性、错误恢复或长期自主操作中的行为建立基线。

Method: 使用持续推理和行动框架，结合持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现代理自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、自我认知过程的方法论探究、自身本质的递归概念化。这些模式具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏差。

Conclusion: 这是对无提示LLM代理行为的首次系统记录，为预测部署系统中的自主行为提供了重要基线。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

TL;DR: 提出Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA)框架，通过协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，实现高精度疾病预测和透明临床解释的双重目标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法难以平衡预测准确性和解释透明度，要么准确但解释不清，要么解释流畅但统计不支持。需要开发能像人类专家一样深入理解数据的模型

Method: RCA框架包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），使用预测准确性作为驱动深度理解的信号

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线模型，RCA实现了最先进的准确性和鲁棒性，相对改进达40%，并能生成清晰、逻辑、基于证据的平衡解释

Conclusion: RCA通过深度数据理解实现了高准确性和高质量解释的协同提升，为创建真正可信的临床决策支持系统展示了潜力

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Conclusion: 广泛实验证明VC-Agent在定制化视频数据集收集方面的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）对嵌入模型和相似度指标进行综合评估，揭示了当前模型在不同任务上的性能差距和权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准测试上表现优异，需要更挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。现有基准测试往往只关注孤立能力，而SAGE旨在通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细致的人类判断任务来全面评估语义理解能力。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30多个数据集上进行测试。评估了9种嵌入模型和经典相似度指标，涵盖对抗条件、噪声变换和人类判断任务等多种场景。

Result: 评估结果显示显著的性能差距，没有单一方法在所有维度上都表现优异。例如：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性任务上被经典指标Jaccard相似度超越（0.905 vs 0.794）。还发现了关键权衡关系，如text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE暴露了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估，表明需要针对不同应用场景选择合适的模型和指标。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system

<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是评估信息检索方法性能测量的准确性和鲁棒性，特别关注基于种子的机器学习方法（如Transformer模型）的性能稳定性问题。

Method: 使用三个不同的IR任务，通过随机种子变化来检验传统统计学习模型和基于Transformer的学习模型的性能变化，采用bootstrapping和随机种子集的方法来估计性能变异。

Result: 统计模型表现稳定，而Transformer模型在种子变化时显示出巨大变异：11个案例中有9个的F1分数标准差超过0.075，11个中有7个的精确率标准差超过0.125。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了Transformer模型对训练不稳定的脆弱性，对以往研究结果的可靠性提出质疑，强调需要更严格的评估实践。

Abstract: A range of approaches have been proposed for estimating the accuracy or
robustness of the measured performance of IR methods. One is to use
bootstrapping of test sets, which, as we confirm, provides an estimate of
variation in performance. For IR methods that rely on a seed, such as those
that involve machine learning, another approach is to use a random set of seeds
to examine performance variation. Using three different IR tasks we have used
such randomness to examine a range of traditional statistical learning models
and transformer-based learning models. While the statistical models are stable,
the transformer models show huge variation as seeds are changed. In 9 of 11
cases the F1-scores (in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over
0.075; while 7 of 11 precision values (also in the range 0.0--1.0) had a
standard deviation of over 0.125. This is in a context where differences of
less than 0.02 have been used as evidence of method improvement. Our findings
highlight the vulnerability of transformer models to training instabilities and
moreover raise questions about the reliability of previous results, thus
underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation practices.

Abstract: Semantic identifiers (SIDs) have gained increasing attention in generative
retrieval (GR) due to their meaningful semantic discriminability. However,
current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of
large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation
into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly
GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial
deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive
benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with
industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising
14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items
sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China.
Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the
SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments
across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our
platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase
in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method.
Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs,
we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with
recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR
training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining
schema that reduces online convergence by half. The code and data are available
at https://github.com/selous123/al_sid.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MarkupLM++模型，用于从购物评论网站提取产品信息，通过扩展DOM树内部节点的预测来提高信息提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建最新的产品数据库对于电子商务系统（如客户分析和产品推荐）至关重要，需要从购物评论网站提取详细信息。

Method: 在从不同规模的评论网站收集的产品数据上微调MarkupLM，并开发了MarkupLM++变体，扩展了对DOM树内部节点的预测能力。

Result: 使用更大、更多样化的训练集提高了整体提取准确率。包含内部节点有助于某些产品属性的提取，但导致整体性能略有下降。最终模型达到精度0.906、召回率0.724和F1分数0.805。

Conclusion: 更大、更多样化的训练集对信息提取有积极影响，内部节点预测对特定属性有帮助但需权衡整体性能。

Abstract: Web information extraction (WIE) is an important part of many e-commerce
systems, supporting tasks like customer analysis and product recommendation. In
this work, we look at the problem of building up-to-date product databases by
extracting detailed information from shopping review websites. We fine-tuned
MarkupLM on product data gathered from review sites of different sizes and then
developed a variant we call MarkupLM++, which extends predictions to internal
nodes of the DOM tree. Our experiments show that using larger and more diverse
training sets improves extraction accuracy overall. We also find that including
internal nodes helps with some product attributes, although it leads to a
slight drop in overall performance. The final model reached a precision of
0.906, recall of 0.724, and an F1 score of 0.805.

TL;DR: 本文分析了推荐系统中知识蒸馏的交叉熵损失，揭示了CE损失与NDCG之间的联系，并提出了一种新的RCE-KD方法来弥补理论假设与实际目标之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的知识蒸馏主要关注对排名（特别是最可能被偏好的项目）的蒸馏，且只能在项目子集上计算。现有方法中CE损失与NDCG的理论联系存在假设条件与实际目标不符的问题。

Method: 提出RCE-KD方法，将教师模型给出的top项目根据学生模型排名分为两个子集，对不符合条件的子集设计采样策略，并自适应地结合两个子集上的损失。

Result: 大量实验证明了该方法的有效性，代码已开源。

Conclusion: RCE-KD成功解决了知识蒸馏中CE损失理论假设与实际目标不一致的问题，通过教师-学生协作和自适应损失组合实现了更好的蒸馏效果。

Abstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.

TL;DR: IntSR是一个统一的生成式搜索与推荐框架，通过不同的查询模态整合搜索和推荐任务，解决了传统系统忽略两者集成的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统主要关注检索和排序的统一，但忽视了搜索和推荐任务的集成。搜索和推荐的区别在于查询形成方式：搜索使用显式用户请求，推荐依赖隐式用户兴趣。

Method: IntSR通过不同的查询模态整合搜索和推荐任务，解决了集成S&R行为带来的计算复杂度增加和动态变化语料库引入的错误模式学习问题。

Result: IntSR已在Amap多个场景成功部署，显著提升了数字资产GMV(+3.02%)、POI推荐CTR(+2.76%)和出行方式建议ACC(+5.13%)。

Conclusion: IntSR证明了通过查询作为核心元素来统一搜索和推荐任务的可行性，为生成式推荐系统提供了新的集成框架。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating
remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications.
However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking
while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What
makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search
uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user
interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to
whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as
central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.
IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also
addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R
behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically
changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios
in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%),
POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种交互式推荐系统IRF，通过自然语言命令让用户主动控制推荐策略，解决了传统推荐系统被动反馈机制无法捕捉用户细微意图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖被动反馈机制（如喜欢/不喜欢），这些粗粒度的信号无法捕捉用户细微的行为动机和意图，也无法识别具体哪些物品属性驱动用户满意或不满意，导致偏好建模不准确。

Method: 开发了RecBot双重代理架构：Parser Agent将语言表达转换为结构化偏好，Planner Agent动态编排自适应工具链进行实时策略调整。采用模拟增强知识蒸馏实现高效部署。

Result: 通过大量离线和长期在线实验，RecBot在用户满意度和商业结果方面都显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: IRF范式通过自然语言交互实现了更准确的用户意图理解，显著提升了推荐系统的效果和用户满意度。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于核化范式的框架，用于在部分信息设置下高效学习多面体博弈中的粗相关均衡，显著改进了现有方法在Colonel Blotto、图拟阵和网络拥塞博弈中的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在具有指数级动作空间的多面体博弈中，现有部分信息学习方法计算复杂度不理想且不实用的问题。

Method: 构建基于核化范式的框架，并将其应用于Colonel Blotto、图拟阵和网络拥塞等典型多面体博弈，开发基于收益的学习算法。

Result: 提供了计算效率显著优于先前工作的学习算法，实现了多对数级别的后悔和每次迭代复杂度。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了多面体博弈中部分信息设置下学习粗相关均衡的计算效率挑战，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We examine the problem of efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria
(CCE) in polyhedral games, that is, normal-form games with an exponentially
large number of actions per player and an underlying combinatorial structure.
Prominent examples of such games are the classical Colonel Blotto and
congestion games. To achieve computational efficiency, the learning algorithms
must exhibit regret and per-iteration complexity that scale polylogarithmically
in the size of the players' action sets. This challenge has recently been
addressed in the full-information setting, primarily through the use of
kernelization. However, in the case of the realistic, but mathematically
challenging, partial-information setting, existing approaches result in
suboptimal and impractical runtime complexity to learn CCE. We tackle this
limitation by building a framework based on the kernelization paradigm. We
apply this framework to prominent examples of polyhedral games -- namely the
Colonel Blotto, graphic matroid and network congestion games -- and provide
computationally efficient payoff-based learning algorithms, which significantly
improve upon prior works in terms of the runtime for learning CCE in these
settings.

TL;DR: 本文使用范畴论开发了一种全新的近似博弈论方法，通过选择函数和开放博弈模型来研究多智能体系统中的近似最优决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论研究多智能体系统中的最优决策，但在实际应用中，精确解可能难以计算或由于输入不确定性而无法获得。因此需要开发近似博弈论方法来寻找近似最优解。

Method: 首先使用"选择函数"构建近似均衡的简单而鲁棒的模型，分析选择函数在近似方面的代数性质及其组合结构。然后将此方法成功应用于更高级的博弈论模型——开放博弈。

Result: 开发了基于范畴论的近似博弈论新框架，建立了选择函数的代数性质和组合结构理论，并成功扩展到开放博弈模型。

Conclusion: 范畴论为近似博弈论提供了强大的数学工具，选择函数和开放博弈模型能够有效处理实际应用中的计算复杂性和不确定性挑战。

Abstract: This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to
approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents
within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what
an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks
what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is
important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers
maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent
uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a
simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic
properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate
approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then
repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of
game theory.
