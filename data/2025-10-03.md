### [1] [Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02116)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个端到端框架，在大型空间数据匹配任务中实现精确的召回率控制，通过集成多种阈值估计方法显著降低方差，在数千万几何对数据上保持亚百分位方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模空间数据匹配任务中，精确的召回率控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度人工审核会增加成本。传统置信区间方法存在过度估计和高方差问题。

Method: 使用等网格边界框过滤和CSR候选表示减少配对枚举；确定性xxHash引导样本训练轻量级神经网络排序器；通过四种阈值估计方法（Clopper-Pearson、Jeffreys、Wilson和精确分位数）进行逆方差加权集成；在九个独立子样本上进行融合。

Result: 在两个真实地籍数据集（约631万和6734万对）上评估，该方法能持续达到目标召回率且误差很小，相比其他校准方法减少了冗余验证，可在单个TPU v3核心上端到端运行。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成多种校准方法显著降低了阈值方差，实现了精确的召回率控制，同时保持了计算效率，适用于大规模空间数据匹配任务。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

### [2] [Accelerating Long-Term Molecular Dynamics with Physics-Informed Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01206)
*Hung Le,Sherif Abbas,Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Huu Hiep Nguyen,Dung Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将分子动力学模拟重新定义为时间序列预测问题，使用位移而非绝对位置预测原子轨迹，结合物理知识约束确保物理合理性，实现高效准确的分子动力学模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密度泛函理论(DFT)方法计算成本高昂，限制了长期分子动力学模拟的可行性，需要开发更高效的计算方法。

Method: 将MD模拟建模为时间序列预测问题，使用位移预测原子轨迹，结合基于DFT参数化Morse势函数的物理约束损失函数和推理机制来惩罚非物理原子接近。

Result: 在多种材料上持续超越标准基线方法的模拟精度，能够在几分钟内稳定模拟数千个MD步骤，为昂贵的DFT模拟提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结合物理知识对于提高原子轨迹预测的可靠性和精度至关重要，该方法为分子动力学模拟提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative
to costly DFT simulations.

### [3] [Control the Temperature: Selective Sampling for Diverse and High-Quality LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01218)
*Sergey Troshin,Wafaa Mohammed,Yan Meng,Christof Monz,Antske Fokkens,Vlad Niculae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出选择性采样方法，在数学推理任务中动态切换贪婪采样和高温采样，以平衡多样性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温度采样能增加语言模型输出的多样性，但在需要高精度的数学推理任务中，高温采样会降低推理质量，因为会在敏感解码位置采样到错误续写。

Method: 选择性采样方法：基于采样风险指标动态切换贪婪采样和高温采样。训练轻量级分类器预测采样风险，该分类器可在最小延迟开销下与基础语言模型集成。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样即使在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了数学推理任务中高温采样导致的精度下降问题，通过动态采样策略实现了更好的质量-多样性平衡。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

### [4] [Automated Extraction of Material Properties using LLM-based AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01235)
*Subham Ghosh,Abhishek Tewari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于LLM的自主工作流，从1万篇科学文献中提取热电和结构属性数据，创建了大规模、机器可读的数据集，支持材料发现研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有材料数据库规模小、手动整理或偏向第一性原理结果，实验文献数据未被充分利用，制约了材料的快速发现。

Method: 采用动态令牌分配、零样本多智能体提取和条件表解析的LLM驱动工作流，平衡准确性和计算成本。

Result: 从文献中提取了27,822条温度分辨属性记录，包含热电性能和结构属性，GPT-4.1达到最高准确率(F1=0.91)，GPT-4.1 Mini在成本大幅降低下性能相近。

Conclusion: 提供了迄今最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了交互式网络浏览器便于社区访问。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

### [5] [RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240)
*Zukang Xu,Xing Hu,Qiang Wu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSAVQ是一个新颖的向量量化框架，通过几何驱动创新解决LLM极低位量化中的方向误差和比特分配问题，在2位量化中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数指数增长给资源受限设备部署带来挑战，现有向量量化方法存在无约束方向误差和次优比特分配两个关键问题。

Method: 提出RSAVQ框架，包含两个几何驱动创新：1) 误差方向敏感度引导(EDSG)，利用Fisher信息矩阵诱导的黎曼度量将量化误差投影到参数空间低敏感方向；2) 权重通道敏感度引导(WCSG)，通过FIM曲率分析构建通道级敏感度度量来动态指导比特资源分配。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B的2位量化中，RSAVQ在困惑度上领先基线方法0.4，在零样本准确率上领先1.5。

Conclusion: RSAVQ为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何与神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

### [6] [Adaptive Federated Learning Defences via Trust-Aware Deep Q-Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01261)
*Vedant Palit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过多信号证据整合和序列决策来抵御投毒和后门攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络整合多信号证据进行客户端信任更新，优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上验证：1）基准测试显示准确性稳步提升；2）Dirichlet扫描表明增加客户端重叠能持续提高准确性并降低攻击成功率；3）信号预算研究显示准确性保持稳定而攻击成功率上升；4）DQN在鲁棒性-准确性权衡上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 序列信念更新能缓解弱信号问题，深度Q网络在联邦学习防御中实现了最佳的鲁棒性-准确性权衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

### [7] [Beyond Majority Voting: LLM Aggregation by Leveraging Higher-Order Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01499)
*Rui Ai,Yuqi Pan,David Simchi-Levi,Milind Tambe,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的多智能体LLM答案聚合算法OW和ISP，利用一阶和二阶信息改进多数投票方法，在各种数据集上表现优于标准多数投票。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体LLM推理的快速发展，如何有效聚合多个LLM的答案成为关键挑战。标准多数投票平等对待所有答案，忽略了模型间的潜在异质性和相关性。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊喜流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息进行答案聚合。理论分析表明这些方法能在温和假设下缓解多数投票的固有局限性。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准(UltraFeedback、MMLU)和真实医疗场景(ARMMAN)上实证验证，新方法在所有情况下都持续优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP方法不仅提供了实际性能提升，还为设计鲁棒的多智能体LLM管道提供了概念性洞见。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RSTGCN模型用于预测铁路车站的平均到达延误，在印度铁路网络上实现了最先进的性能，并发布了大规模数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的列车延误预测对铁路运营效率至关重要，现有方法主要关注单个列车的精确延误预测，需要探索支持更高级交通管理的车站级延误预测。

Method: 设计了铁路中心时空图卷积网络(RSTGCN)，包含列车频率感知空间注意力等架构创新和新特征集成，用于预测特定时间段内所有进站列车的平均到达延误。

Result: 在包含4,735个车站的印度铁路网络数据集上进行了广泛实验，相比多个最先进的基线方法，在标准指标上取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了大规模铁路网络中平均延误预测的建模，还提供了开放数据集以促进这一关键领域的进一步研究。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

### [9] [Budgeted Broadcast: An Activity-Dependent Pruning Rule for Neural Network Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01263)
*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过给每个单元分配本地流量预算（激活率×扇出），在全局流量预算约束下最大化编码熵，实现选择性-受众平衡，提高网络效率和表示多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于损失影响（如幅度或梯度）移除参数，但缺乏对网络表示多样性和效率的系统性考虑。

Method: BB方法为每个单元分配本地流量预算，通过约束熵分析推导出选择性-受众平衡公式，使用简单的本地执行器剪枝扇入（降低激活率）或扇出（减少广播）。

Result: BB提高了编码熵和去相关性，在ASR的Transformer、人脸识别的ResNet和突触预测的3D U-Net中，在相同稀疏度下提升了准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上达到了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功支持对抗性多智能体强化学习的可扩展训练，为现实世界对抗场景提供了有效的仿真平台。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these
collaborative settings, adversarial interactions are equally critical for
real-world applications such as pursuit-evasion, security, and competitive
manipulation. In this work, we extend the IsaacLab framework to support
scalable training of adversarial policies in high-fidelity physics simulations.
We introduce a suite of adversarial MARL environments featuring heterogeneous
agents with asymmetric goals and capabilities. Our platform integrates a
competitive variant of Heterogeneous Agent Reinforcement Learning with Proximal
Policy Optimization (HAPPO), enabling efficient training and evaluation under
adversarial dynamics. Experiments across several benchmark scenarios
demonstrate the framework's ability to model and train robust policies for
morphologically diverse multi-agent competition while maintaining high
throughput and simulation realism. Code and benchmarks are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLP是一种信息驱动的强化预训练目标，将强化学习的探索精神引入预训练阶段，通过奖励思维链提供的信息增益来训练模型独立思考行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式只在后训练阶段引入强化学习，作者质疑这是否是最优方式，希望将强化学习的核心精神——探索——更早地引入预训练过程。

Method: 将思维链视为探索性动作，基于思维链为预测未来token提供的信息增益计算奖励信号，具体通过比较在上下文+思维链条件下与仅上下文条件下下一个token的对数似然差异。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练RLP，在8个数学和科学基准上的平均性能提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上应用RLP，整体平均从42.81%提升到61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了下一个token预测与有用思维链推理出现之间的差距，证明了其在不同架构和模型规模上的可扩展性。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

### [12] [Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269)
*Rohan Vitthal Thorat,Juhi Singh,Rajdip Nayek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LQR和强化学习的混合控制框架，用于结构振动控制，解决了RL控制器在训练阶段因缺乏先验知识而可能对结构造成损害的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制需要精确系统模型，而模型无关的RL方法在训练阶段可能因随机控制力对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制情况表现更好。

Method: 设计混合控制框架，将基于随机选择模型的LQR控制器与RL控制器结合。LQR策略不需要真实或近似结构模型知识，整体框架保持模型无关性。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了朴素RL实现中固有的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL基振动控制关键训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Result: 揭示了不同架构中信息中继的独特模式，展示了信息如何随时间处理和维持，节点敲除实验证实了识别节点的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增进了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Motivation: 现有PU学习方法在复杂数据集上表现远逊于监督学习方法，主要瓶颈是在不可靠监督下学习判别性表示的挑战

Method: 结合噪声对鲁棒的非对比监督损失(NoiSNCL)和幻影标签消歧(PLD)方案，前者对齐类内表示，后者通过基于遗憾的标签更新提供保守负监督

Result: 在多种数据集上显著优于现有PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损毁测绘等实际应用场景

Conclusion: NcPU框架有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，在理论和实验上都表现出色，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

TL;DR: 受微眼动启发，提出了一种轻量级位置编码扰动方法，用于检测大语言模型的错误行为，无需微调或任务监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动获得灵感，这些微小运动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地探索LLMs中是否存在可揭示模型错误行为的潜在信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，通过微小的位置编码变化来引发模型的潜在响应信号，从而检测模型的不良行为。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效检测多种错误行为，包括事实性错误、安全性问题、毒性和后门攻击，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLMs已编码了检测自身错误所需的内在证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和减轻不良行为提供了有效途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

*Akshat Ramachandran,Marina Neseem,Charbel Sakr,Rangharajan Venkatesan,Brucek Khailany,Tushar Krishna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思维自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-驱逐策略大幅减少大模型推理时的KV缓存占用，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的长输出上下文生成虽然支持扩展思维链，但也导致KV缓存快速增长，迅速耗尽GPU内存。

Method: 基于注意力稀疏性识别不同重要性的思维类型，采用混合量化-驱逐策略，按思维重要性分配token精度，并随着推理轨迹演进逐步驱逐次要思维的token。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，ThinKV仅使用原始KV缓存的不到5%就能实现近乎无损的准确性，推理吞吐量比最先进基线提升高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思维自适应压缩有效解决了大模型推理中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，实现了内存效率和推理性能的显著提升。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Xiaobo Ma,Hyunsoo Noh,James Tokishi,Ryan Hatch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于估计不同交叉口车辆延误的领域自适应框架GBBW，通过重加权源数据提高模型在目标域的适应性，在57个异构交叉口数据上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型假设训练和测试数据分布相同，但在实际交通应用中，交叉口间的道路几何、信号时序和驾驶行为差异导致模型泛化能力差。需要解决领域偏移问题以提高延误估计准确性。

Method: 采用领域自适应框架，将数据分为源域和目标域，提取关键交通特征，使用目标域的小量标注数据微调模型。提出GBBW模型，基于与目标域的相似性对源数据进行重加权。

Result: 在亚利桑那州皮马县57个异构交叉口数据上测试，与8种先进ML回归模型和7种基于实例的DA方法相比，GBBW框架提供了更准确和鲁棒的延误估计。

Conclusion: 该框架通过增强模型可迁移性，支持更可靠的交通信号优化、拥堵管理和基于性能的规划，促进了机器学习技术在真实交通系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from
2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly
important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational
modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI
reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based,
shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current
state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of
their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets,
computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

Motivation: 研究神经网络梯度结构，特别是放宽传统各向同性假设，在更一般的数据和参数条件下分析梯度特性，理解训练动态和正则化机制。

Method: 采用尖峰数据模型，允许数据体各向异性和病态，不要求数据和权重矩阵独立，同时分析平均场和神经正切核两种缩放机制。

Result: 发现输入权重梯度近似低秩，由两个秩1项主导，其平衡受训练数据特性、缩放机制和激活函数影响。标准正则化器如权重衰减、输入噪声和雅可比惩罚能选择性地调节这些分量。

Conclusion: 理论预测在合成和真实数据实验中得到验证，为理解神经网络训练动态和正则化机制提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian
penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic
and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，用于评估现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在复杂流形上表现差异大，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法。

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建无限族拓扑非平凡流形，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，并测试多种IDE方法。

Result: 现有IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性低于现有基准，且性能随曲率不均匀性增加而下降较小，表明基准本身具有挑战性。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更严格的测试环境，揭示了现有方法在复杂流形上的局限性。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video
data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their
statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action
representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our
analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations
perform well in practice.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习训练范式：自蒸馏互信息(SDMI)和联合互信息(JMI)，为现有方法的架构组件提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其基本原理仍不够清晰。现有工作通常将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性补充，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出SDMI和JMI两种训练范式。SDMI需要交替优化，理论要求停止梯度操作；JMI允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。

Result: 证明了现有SSRL方法是这两种范式的具体实例或近似，预测器网络和统计正则化器分别是SDMI和JMI中互信息目标的可行替代方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为不同SSRL方法的架构组件选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释，统一了现有方法的理论基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数据集各向异性的方法，通过双样本神经网络分类器测试来量化数据集的对称性破坏程度，并探讨了分布对称性破坏如何影响等变方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称感知方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"。本文旨在批判性评估这一假设，量化数据集的各向异性程度。

Method: 提出了一种度量数据集各向异性的方法，使用双样本神经网络分类器测试来区分原始数据集与其随机增强的等效数据集。在合成数据集上验证了该度量，并将其应用于多个基准点云数据集。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐性。理论分析表明，分布对称性破坏会阻止不变方法达到最优性能，即使底层标签确实是不变的。实证研究发现等变方法的效益具有数据集依赖性。

Conclusion: 理解等变性——包括其何时有效及原因——可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏差，等变方法在部分各向异性数据集上仍有益处，但并非所有情况都如此。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习得分函数用于生成样本，但一个基本未解决的问题是：它们实际学习的是哪个得分函数？如果完全匹配经验得分函数，模型只会复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Method: 引入选择性欠拟合的概念，通过设计经验干预来验证这一观点，并表征这些区域的特征。

Result: 研究结果表明，更好的扩散模型在输入空间的特定区域更准确地近似得分函数，而在其他区域保持欠拟合状态。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为研究其泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

TL;DR: PRISM是一种轻量级的自校正方法，适用于任何预训练的掩码扩散模型，通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力来检测和修正推理时的低质量token，但现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用性。

Method: PRISM通过定义自校正损失来学习每个token的质量分数，这些分数在MDM的前向传递中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本（170M）以及使用LLaDA的代码（8B）。

Conclusion: PRISM为掩码扩散模型提供了一种模型无关的轻量级自校正方法，理论上能学习token质量分数，实证上在多个领域表现优异。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Motivation: LLM生成需要在输出质量和推理成本之间取得平衡，特别是在多轮生成场景下，需要优化停止生成的决策时机。

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价昂贵的"盒子"，开发了UCB风格的Pandora's Box算法，并针对实际LLM设置通过Bradley-Terry变换解决奖励缩放问题。

Conclusion: 该研究在最优停止理论和推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

TL;DR: 提出基于低秩表示和向量量化的压缩重建框架，显著降低神经压缩中解码器的计算开销，同时保持高质量图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经压缩方法虽然压缩率高，但基于卷积的解码器计算复杂且成本高，阻碍了技术应用。

Method: 在带有向量量化的自编码器中引入低秩表示，通过对学习到的潜在表示执行一系列计算高效的低秩操作来重建数据。

Result: 大幅减少神经压缩/重建解码阶段的计算开销，基本消除解码器计算瓶颈，同时保持高质量图像输出。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

*Dorsa Soleymani,Ali Dadsetan,Frank Rudzicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，使用平滑的tanh变换替代硬裁剪，在保护敏感数据的同时显著减少子群体间的不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号，导致模型性能和公平性下降，特别是对代表性不足的群体。

Method: 提出SoftAdaClip方法，用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在限制敏感性的同时保留相对梯度幅度，结合自适应机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验显示，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少48%，且差异减少具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平且私有的模型训练至关重要，SoftAdaClip在保护隐私的同时显著提升了公平性。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

*Yifei Zuo,Yutong Yin,Zhichen Zeng,Ang Li,Banghua Zhu,Zhaoran Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Local Linear Attention (LLA)，一种基于非参数统计理论的新型注意力机制，通过测试时回归视角推导而来。LLA在理论分析中优于线性和Softmax注意力，并通过FlashLLA算法实现硬件高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Softmax注意力的高效替代方案已被广泛研究，但基于理论洞察寻找更具表达力的机制（即使计算成本更高）相对较少探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从非参数统计学的测试时回归角度推导出LLA，提出两种内存高效原语解决计算复杂度问题，开发FlashLLA硬件高效块状算法，并实现定制推理内核减少内存开销。

Result: 实验验证显示LLA能有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，并展现出在大规模模型中可扩展性和适用性的有希望证据。

Conclusion: LLA通过理论优势和实践实现，为注意力机制提供了新的研究方向，特别是在处理非平稳数据和上下文学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCOPED是一种快速通用的扩散模型OOD检测方法，通过结合雅可比矩阵迹和得分函数平方范数，将前向传播次数减少一个数量级，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的OOD检测方法计算成本高，限制了在实际应用中的部署。需要开发一种既快速又准确的OOD检测方法，特别是在扩散模型等计算密集型模型中。

Method: SCOPED结合雅可比矩阵迹和得分函数平方范数作为测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传播和一次雅可比向量积，通过Hutchinson迹估计器提高效率。

Result: 在四个视觉基准测试中，SCOPED实现了竞争性或最先进的精度-召回分数，同时在机器人控制任务中也能识别跨奖励函数和训练机制的分布偏移。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域提供了快速可靠的OOD检测实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影检测、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集筛选。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了基于模型的强化学习算法MBPO在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，识别了动态模型与奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配和目标表示选择不当两个关键问题，并提出解决方案使MBPO在多个任务中超越模型自由方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MBPO算法在OpenAI Gym中表现优异但在DeepMind Control Suite中表现不佳的原因，揭示环境特定假设如何隐式编码到算法设计中，以及评估局限性的影响。

Method: 识别MBPO失败的两个耦合问题：动态模型与奖励模型之间的尺度不匹配导致批评者低估，以及目标表示选择不当增加模型方差和错误传播。通过解决这些问题来改进算法。

Result: 解决失败模式后，MBPO在七个DeepMind Control Suite任务中的五个任务中超越了模型自由算法SAC，同时保持了在OpenAI Gym中的优异表现。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要开发将MDP任务和环境结构与算法失败模式联系起来的分类法，追求统一解决方案，并澄清基准选择如何最终塑造算法泛化的条件。

Abstract: Synthetic data is a core component of data-efficient Dyna-style model-based
reinforcement learning, yet it can also degrade performance. We study when it
helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting
failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We
focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Conclusion: 该研究为在噪声条件下开发符合人类偏好的AI系统提供了有价值的见解，强调了考虑现实噪声对偏好优化的重要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上的评估表明，LSPO能持续提升学习效果，并通过消融研究验证了长度信号整合方式的影响。

Conclusion: LSPO为RLVR训练提供了有效的动态采样策略，并为未来研究指明了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致：在一个设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一个设置中可能完全失败。

Method: 提出了稳定性-可塑性原则，识别了三种在线微调机制，每种机制需要不同的稳定性属性。通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中有45个案例的结果与该框架的预测高度一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了一个原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法，使用LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层来处理高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程在处理高维不规则变量（如分类、序数变量）时效果不佳，而神经网络代理模型计算成本高。LLM具有强大的建模能力，可作为高效代理模型。

Method: 使用LLM作为代理模型，通过LoRA微调参数，结合变分贝叶斯线性层（VBLL）进行后验推断。采用加权集成（ENS）自动选择LoRA秩等超参数。

Result: 在多个高维基准测试和真实分子优化任务中表现出色，计算效率高且支持递归更新。

Conclusion: 提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法有效解决了高维黑盒优化问题，在性能和计算效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于大语言模型的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，在降低搜索成本的同时解决LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超网方法需要多GPU天，而LLM驱动的方法虽然快速但存在探索偏差，无法发现整个搜索空间中不同延迟范围的架构。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动的分区引擎按复杂度划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法；3) 零成本预测器避免从头训练大量候选架构。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS实现了更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似准确率下延迟比基线降低54%，搜索成本从几天降至几分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS能够高效生成高精度低延迟的神经网络架构，显著降低了硬件感知神经架构搜索的成本和探索偏差。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常受对抗性污染、系统错误或低质量样本影响，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要开发对数据污染鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用小型干净参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，对密度比进行裁剪后作为权重用于行为克隆目标，优先学习干净专家行为。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下仍保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC方法能有效处理污染数据集，无需了解污染机制，具有理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Motivation: 解释为何图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在模型间成功转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移，探究对抗性转移的根本机制。

Method: 通过数学证明和四个实验验证：1) 理论证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2) 构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3) 构建语言模型的表示空间攻击；4) 构建视觉语言模型的数据空间和表示空间攻击。

Result: 数据空间攻击成功转移，表示空间攻击无法转移，除非表示空间几何对齐。视觉语言模型的表示空间攻击在投影器后空间几何对齐时可以转移。

Conclusion: 对抗性转移不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有重要启示。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

TL;DR: 提出了Flock模型，通过概率节点-关系等变性解决知识图谱零样本链接预测问题，在54个不同领域的知识图谱上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱基础模型(KGFMs)的确定性等变性限制了表达能力，无法区分结构相似但语义不同的关系，需要突破这一限制。

Method: 引入概率节点-关系等变性，通过迭代采样随机游走、编码序列、序列模型嵌入和池化聚合表示，构建Flock模型。

Result: Flock完美解决了新的诊断数据集Petals，在54个不同领域的知识图谱上实现了实体和关系预测任务的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 概率节点-关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的有效方法，Flock模型在零样本链接预测任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个预测框架，利用FDA兽医医学中心的128万份报告，通过机器学习模型预测兽医药物安全结果（死亡vs康复），结合数据预处理、特征工程和可解释AI方法，实现了高精度的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保食品生产动物中药品的安全使用对保护动物福利和人类食品安全至关重要。不良事件可能预示着意外的药代动力学或毒代动力学效应，增加食品链中违规残留的风险。

Method: 构建数据预处理流程整合关系表并通过VeDDRA本体标准化不良事件；评估包括随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost、ExcelFormer和大语言模型在内的监督模型；使用欠采样和过采样处理类别不平衡；采用集成方法和基于平均不确定性边际的伪标签方法。

Conclusion: 该框架表明，结合严格的数据工程、先进的机器学习和可解释AI，能够实现准确、可解释的兽医安全结果预测，支持FARAD使命，实现高风险药物事件配置的早期检测，加强残留风险评估，并为监管和临床决策提供信息。

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarbonX是一个基于时间序列基础模型的开源工具，用于碳强度预测和插补等脱碳任务，仅需历史碳强度数据即可在全球214个电网实现零样本预测，MAPE为15.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三个主要限制：(1)需要电网特定的电力结构数据，在信息不可用时无法使用；(2)依赖单独的电网特定模型，难以提供全球覆盖；(3)不提供不确定性估计，限制了碳感知应用的可靠性。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，实现碳强度预测和插补等多任务处理，并提供预测区间。

Result: 在214个全球电网实现零样本预测MAPE为15.82%；在13个基准电网平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%，提供95%覆盖率的预测区间；可提供长达21天的预测且精度下降最小；完全微调后在插补任务上比统计基线好1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX可以在数据有限的任何电网中轻松使用并提供强大性能，是面向全球规模脱碳的实用工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种改进二值神经网络验证的整数规划方法：新的多类别线性目标函数和利用BNN递归结构的有效不等式生成技术，提高了验证效率和扰动范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二值神经网络验证问题可以表述为整数规划问题，但传统的IP公式由于大M约束导致的巨大完整性差距而难以求解，需要改进IP公式来提高验证效率。

Method: 1. 为多类别设置引入新的线性目标函数方法；2. 开发利用BNN递归结构生成有效不等式的技术，改进IP公式。

Result: 与现有IP方法相比，在有限时间内能够验证BNN对抗更高范围的输入扰动。

Conclusion: 提出的两种技术显著改善了二值神经网络的验证性能，使IP方法能够处理更大的扰动范围。

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

TL;DR: 提出Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过往返转换成功率作为奖励信号来训练模型提高一致性，显著提升化学LLM的性能和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型在双向任务中缺乏往返一致性，表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握，往返一致性已成为模型改进的直接目标。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用往返转换成功作为奖励信号训练模型；提出迭代变体，让前向和反向映射在自改进循环中交替训练，对海量未标记数据特别有效。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下，显著提升了基线模型的性能和一致性。

Conclusion: 往返一致性不仅是理想属性，而且是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的攻击方法，能够绕过大型语言模型的提示防护机制，成功越狱多个生产模型，揭示了轻量级提示防护的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，确保AI安全和对齐变得至关重要。轻量级提示防护机制虽然易于实施和更新，但其安全性存在隐患。

Method: 利用提示防护机制与主模型之间的资源不对称性，编码一个轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够解码的越狱提示。

Result: 该方法在Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等高度保护的聊天界面中持续成功越狱，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 揭示了现代LLM架构中轻量级提示防护固有的攻击面，强调需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

Conclusion: TSci成功将时间序列预测工作流转变为白盒系统，既具有可解释性又能在不同任务间扩展，为自动化时间序列预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

Motivation: 现有评估方法往往跳过反事实推理中的溯因步骤，导致高估LLM能力。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤的框架。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，使用代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，要求完整的溯因、干预和预测三个步骤，并创建可扩展的合成数据。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%。监督微调能提升域内性能但损害跨域泛化，而强化学习在代码和数学问题上均实现1.5-2倍提升。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并泛化到新领域，为提升LLM反事实推理能力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的交互式模仿学习方法仅修正当前状态的动作，而不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作，这限制了学习效果和安全性。

Method: PPL方法将每次人类干预引导到未来L个时间步（偏好视野），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，然后对这些未来状态应用偏好优化。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中，PPL方法显著提高了学习效率，减少了所需的人类演示数量。

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好视野L可以在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距，PPL方法具有高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL代理正则化，约束采样轨迹，防止奖励黑客；还提出MIRA-DPO将偏好优化映射到推理时

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL上，针对多种奖励（美学评分、HPSv2、PickScore）和公共数据集，MIRA达到>60%胜率，保持提示一致性，奖励增益几乎无漂移

Conclusion: MIRA是无需训练的高效推理时对齐方法，能有效防止奖励黑客，在提升奖励的同时保持图像质量，并可扩展到不可微奖励

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

Motivation: RLHF方法使用KL散度来稳定训练，但不同实现方式存在理论混淆，需要建立统一框架来分析各种KL正则化实现的理论基础。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了基于梯度的理论依据，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

*Seong Woo Han,Daniel Duy Vo,Brielin C. Brown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD)框架，利用干预数据进行因果发现，通过建模总因果效应矩阵的似然，结合稀疏先验和数据驱动的网络结构权重，实现不确定性感知的因果图推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法在大规模任务上性能较差，且无法量化不确定性。高通量基因组扰动数据的出现为利用干预数据改进模型识别提供了机会。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然（近似矩阵正态分布），使用spike-and-slab horseshoe先验，从观测数据中分别学习scale-free和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性感知推断。

Result: 通过大量模拟实验，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法。应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，边缘后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中表现出优越性能，能够有效处理大规模干预数据并提供不确定性量化，为基因组扰动数据的因果推断提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

TL;DR: TetriServe通过步级序列并行和轮次调度机制，动态调整DiT模型的并行度，在保证图像质量的同时显著提高了服务等级目标达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，无法有效处理异构工作负载（混合分辨率和截止时间），导致GPU利用率低和服务等级目标达成率差。

Method: 提出步级序列并行策略，动态调整单个请求的并行度；设计基于轮次的调度机制，包括时间离散化、步级并行度适配和请求联合打包。

Result: 在先进的DiT模型上评估显示，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的服务等级目标达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行度调整和智能调度策略，有效解决了DiT模型服务中的计算效率问题，显著提升了服务性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

TL;DR: 将强化学习与蛋白质语言模型结合，在四个蛋白质设计领域验证RL能否超越监督学习，发现RL能提升采样效率和成功率，性能受任务空间、奖励准确性和策略容量三因素共同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习是否能推动蛋白质语言模型超越其预训练先验，揭示潜在的序列-结构-功能规则，这是监督学习可能无法捕捉的能力。

Method: 在抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和反向折叠四个领域，使用多种RL算法和模型类别，将RL与PLMs配对进行实验。

Result: RL在所有基准测试中持续提升成功率和采样效率，性能改进受任务头空间、奖励保真度和策略容量三因素交互影响，当奖励准确且信息丰富时改进显著。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL应用提供实用指导：优先奖励建模和校准，匹配算法与任务难度，在边际收益最大的地方分配容量，奖励准确性比策略规模更重要。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

TL;DR: SPAMP是一个统一的梯度整形框架，将硬性梯度裁剪推广为平滑的逐层梯度调制，通过跟踪梯度统计信息并动态估计阈值来改善深度网络训练的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度裁剪使用固定的硬性阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布的动态特性，限制了训练效果。

Method: SPAMP框架跟踪局部梯度统计信息，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新表述为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP为控制梯度更新规模提供了原则性替代方案，超越了传统的刚性启发式方法，显著改善了深度网络训练效果。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

TL;DR: TRAAC是一种在线后训练强化学习方法，通过自适应压缩推理步骤来解决模型在复杂推理任务中的欠适应性问题，平衡欠思考与过度思考，提高准确率并减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维模型在解决复杂推理任务时存在欠适应性问题：对于简单问题过度思考导致token效率低下，对于困难问题欠思考导致错误。需要一种能根据问题难度自适应调整推理长度的方法。

Method: 提出TRAAC方法，利用模型在长推理轨迹上的自注意力来识别重要步骤并修剪冗余步骤，同时估计问题难度并将其纳入训练奖励，学习根据示例难度分配推理预算。

Result: 在多种任务上，TRAAC相比基础模型平均绝对准确率提升8.4%，推理长度相对减少36.8%；相比最佳RL基线准确率提升7.9%，长度减少29.4%。在分布外非数学数据集上也表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TRAAC通过任务难度校准和基于注意力的压缩相结合，能够在多样化任务上实现准确率和效率的提升，为推理模型提供了细粒度的思考预算调整机制。

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time
compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On
one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在的三种噪声（患者操作误差、环境噪声、数据传输丢失）导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加，需要开发噪声鲁棒的方法。

Method: 1. 基于选定特征的连续值将语音特征分组为有序区间；2. 使用对比对训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征；3. 将原始特征与噪声鲁棒特征拼接作为增强特征输入预测模型。

Result: 实验表明NoRo框架在不同噪声环境下能成功增强各种下游预测模型的噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NoRo框架通过对比学习和特征增强有效解决了帕金森病远程监测中的噪声问题，提高了UPDRS评分预测的准确性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测模式，易受攻击者利用，而传统防御方法存在显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 开发基于STT-MTJs的硬件真随机数生成系统，使用FPGA辅助的原型计算系统，将硬件随机位集成到生成对抗网络(GAN)中。

Result: 系统实现了兆比特/秒的真随机数生成，通过NIST随机性测试，在CIFAR-10数据集上训练的GAN中，相比低质量随机数生成器基线，不安全输出减少了18.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和可扩展性，有望扩展到106个并行单元，实现千兆比特/秒的吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样，是下一代生成式AI系统的实用安全组件。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

Motivation: 理解变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，揭示其不是单纯的优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变。

Method: 通过分析与后验坍塌相关的平凡解的稳定性，识别超参数临界阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现了将有意义潜在推断与坍塌分开的临界边界，该边界以近似后验与先验分布之间KL散度的不连续性为特征。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是一种新兴的相变，这一视角为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

TL;DR: 挑战当前LLM后训练中SFT和RL两阶段独立训练的做法，发现高SFT分数并不总能转化为RL后的性能提升，甚至可能更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为RL结果的强预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM后训练实践中，SFT和RL作为两个独立阶段进行，但高SFT分数是否能可靠预测RL后的性能提升存在疑问。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和RLVR（通过GRPO），在7个数学基准测试上进行广泛评估，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 发现高SFT分数可能偏向简单或同质数据，不能可靠预测后续RL增益。基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测比直接使用预RL性能预测精度显著提高，R²和Spearman秩相关系数提升高达0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL结果的可靠预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k提供了更好的预测能力，这对实际应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Motivation: 高质量训练数据对LLM扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术可能突破这一限制，需要系统评估其实际效果。

Method: 使用统一协议和缩放定律进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据类型及其混合。

Result: 纯改写合成数据训练不比自然文本快；1/3改写合成数据+2/3自然文本混合可加速5-10倍；纯教科书风格合成数据导致下游任务损失显著增加；最佳合成数据比例约30%。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性益处，混合使用改写合成数据可显著加速训练，但需谨慎选择合成数据类型和比例。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有方法需要预先选择单一几何，无法适应混合几何特性的数据。

Method: 使用轻量级可微分门控机制，动态学习每个token在三个几何注意力分支间的路由。每个分支采用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准（FB15k-237, WN18RR）上，相比固定几何基线，MRR和Hits@10提升约10%，参数仅增加5%，推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习几何自适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展且可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Result: 在开源LLM上对各种编辑场景进行评估，显示出在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印框架能够有效检测和定位水印LLM输出中的后生成编辑。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

TL;DR: 本文提出REFEREE方法，解决无源跨域持续学习问题，禁止使用源域样本，通过频率感知提示技术和不确定性加权策略处理域偏移和噪声伪标签问题，使用KLDA缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域持续学习方法需要完全标记的源域数据，这在隐私受限环境中不可行。本文旨在解决无源跨域持续学习问题，完全禁止使用源域样本。

Method: 结合源预训练模型和大规模视觉语言模型；使用频率感知提示技术处理域偏移；采用不确定性加权策略减轻噪声伪标签影响；使用核线性判别分析(KLDA)缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: 严格的数值研究证实了方法的优势，在多个基准测试中显著超越了需要访问源域样本的现有方法。

Conclusion: REFEREE方法成功解决了无源跨域持续学习问题，通过频率感知动态提示协作和KLDA技术，在禁止使用源域样本的情况下仍能取得优异性能。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Elsa的神经网络剪枝方法，通过约束优化技术实现90%的极端稀疏度，同时保持高模型精度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络剪枝方法在超过50-60%稀疏度时会严重降低模型精度，无法突破这一瓶颈，需要更有效的剪枝技术来减少大型语言模型的计算和内存需求。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决现有方法依赖代理目标函数的问题，并提出量化变体Elsa-L以扩展到超大型模型。

Result: 在多种模型和规模上取得显著改进，在LLaMA-2-7B模型90%稀疏度下，困惑度比现有最佳方法低7.8倍，并能扩展到27B超大型模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在推进LLM稀疏化前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在尚未充分探索的方向上仍存在显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种为大规模语言模型设计的强化学习框架，通过使用轻量级mini-critics集合来恢复critic角色，解决了传统价值函数在LLM规模下计算成本高且稀疏奖励下失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL4LLM方法避免使用显式critic，主要因为传统价值函数在LLM规模下计算昂贵，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下经常失效。作者从架构角度重新审视这一瓶颈。

Method: AsyPPO采用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用critic间不确定性来优化策略更新：在critic一致时屏蔽优势，从熵正则化中过滤高分歧状态。

Result: 在仅有5000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比GRPO等强基线，在Qwen3-4b-Base上获得超过6%的性能提升，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上获得约3%的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO在不使用额外技巧的情况下显著优于经典PPO。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

TL;DR: TimeHUT是一种通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡对比表示来学习时间序列表示的新方法，在分类任务上显著优于现有方法，在异常检测任务上获得有竞争力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在在嵌入空间中实现均匀性和容忍度的有效平衡，以学习更强的时间序列表示。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息，集成温度调度器平衡嵌入特性，应用层次化角度边界损失增强正负样本对的分离。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上的分类任务中显著优于现有方法，在Yahoo和KPI数据集上的异常检测任务中获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡机制有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN节点重要性，解决传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题，实现有效的网络压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示，但其架构对传统剪枝方法构成挑战，特别是基于幅度的剪枝方法因对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN在保持真实节点重要性的同时实现了有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提高了KAN的可解释性优势，促进了在资源受限环境中的部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络(AGFN)，通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制自适应调整特征权重，以缓解噪声模态影响并优先考虑信息线索，从而提升多模态情感分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简单的多模态融合技术往往无法考虑模态质量的变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在辨别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 采用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，包括单模态编码和跨模态交互后优先考虑信息线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线，能有效辨别细微情感且具有鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，从更广泛的特征分布中学习，增强了泛化能力，创建了更鲁棒的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种悲观的品类优化框架PASTA，在数据覆盖不足的情况下实现最优预期收益，适用于多种选择模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 品类优化问题中，企业缺乏选择模型的先验知识，需要基于历史客户选择数据确定最优品类。组合性质导致数据覆盖不足，设计有效解决方案具有挑战性。

Method: 引入悲观品类优化框架PASTA，利用悲观原则在一般选择模型下实现最优预期收益。仅要求离线数据分布包含最优品类，而非覆盖所有可行品类。

Result: 为多项logit和嵌套logit等广泛使用的选择模型建立了首个离线品类优化的有限样本遗憾界。推导了极小极大遗憾下界，证明PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面达到极小极大最优。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在数据覆盖不足的情况下有效解决了离线品类优化问题，理论分析和数值实验均表明其优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT)框架，通过全局最优传输解决神经网络表示对齐问题，克服传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示相似性方法存在不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐分数、难以处理不同深度网络的问题，这些源于忽略全局激活结构和限制于刚性层对层对应关系。

Method: HOT联合推断软性、全局一致的层对层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元跨多个目标层分布质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示平滑、细粒度的层次对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别适用于架构或深度不同的网络。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

TL;DR: ActiNet模型（自监督ResNet-V2+HMM）在手腕加速度计活动强度分类中表现优于传统随机森林+HMM方法，F1分数达0.82，适用于大规模流行病学研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人体活动识别模型来分析手腕加速度计数据，以研究体力活动与健康结果的关联。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（18层自监督改进ResNet-V2），结合隐马尔可夫模型平滑，并与基线随机森林+HMM方法比较。

Result: ActiNet模型平均宏观F1分数0.82，Cohen's kappa分数0.86，优于RF+HMM的0.77和0.81，在不同年龄和性别亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: ActiNet模型适用于从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签，建议在未来的流行病学研究中采用。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为实际应用提供了理论保证和高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

Motivation: 注意力机制是大语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化主要关注I/O层面的系统优化，缺乏数学保证的无损算法级加速方法。

Method: 基于基础分解(BD)的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重构为紧凑形式，保持输出完全一致，实现架构无关的数学加速。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16)上，仅需4秒离线准备，无需重新训练，在现代GPU上实现32%更快的键值投影和25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为模型推理提供了新的算法级加速途径。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖于限制性折扣因子假设，缺乏在函数逼近下的理论保证，而实际应用中鲁棒RL算法已取得经验成功。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，开发了无需模型且不需要MDP生成访问的鲁棒TD学习算法。

Result: 建立了获得ε-准确值估计的Õ(1/ε²)样本复杂度，填补了鲁棒RL算法经验成功与非鲁棒对应物非渐近保证之间的关键差距。

Conclusion: 该算法首次在函数逼近下实现了鲁棒TD学习，关键思想可相对直接地扩展到具有函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面存在挑战，需要更好的方法来理解复杂决策模式。

Method: 使用深度神经网络方法对工作地点选择进行建模，并与传统离散选择模型进行比较。

Result: DNN在复制工作机会对工作地点选择影响方面与DCM效果相当，但在某些方面表现更好；DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离影响时与数据更吻合；DCM在短距离表现更优，DNN在长距离表现与DCM相当。

Conclusion: 选择工作地点分析模型应根据具体应用需求，DNN显示出作为DCM强大替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的不均衡影响，并在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析，包括评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体。

Result: 发现不同指标上的不均衡影响并不一致，直接优化DP模型超参数不能可靠减轻不均衡影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡。DPSGD-Global-Adapt在超参数选择方面不是稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄漏，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间进行仔细权衡。直接优化DP模型超参数能改善效用-公平性权衡，但不能可靠减轻DPSGD的不均衡影响。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督动态特征选择(DFS)方法，通过移除图像中的误导性或冗余信息来增强潜在表示，提高模型的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表示常受噪声或不相关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择方法，为每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导或冗余信息，确保只有最相关特征贡献于潜在空间。

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在聚类和图像生成等任务中显著提高了泛化性能，计算成本仅轻微增加。

Conclusion: 无监督DFS方法能有效增强潜在表示，提高模型性能，且不依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频游戏环境计算成本高且受CPU限制，不适合大规模强化学习实验，需要既具有挑战性又可扩展的GPU加速环境。

Method: 基于CHIP-8仿真在JAX中实现经典街机游戏环境，提供图像化环境，涵盖解谜、动作和策略游戏类型，支持大规模GPU并行执行。

Result: 相比传统CPU仿真器实现数量级加速，在多个游戏中训练RL智能体显示训练速度和可扩展性显著提升，同时保持原始游戏机制完美保真。

Conclusion: Octax为JAX社区提供了期待已久的端到端GPU替代Atari基准，其模块化设计便于扩展新游戏或使用大语言模型生成新环境，是理想的大规模RL实验平台。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Motivation: 先前研究分别关注基于势能的架构和退化变分积分器，但在结合两者时出现新问题，学习模型因方案的规范依赖性而数值不稳定，无法进行长时间模拟。

Method: 提出两种训练策略：1) 直接学习向量场；2) 通过方案学习时间离散动力学。

Result: 多个数值测试案例评估了方法学习复杂物理动力学的能力，如陀螺动力学等离子体物理中的引导中心。

Conclusion: 识别了规范依赖性问题，并提出了有效的训练策略来解决学习非规范哈密顿动力学时的数值不稳定问题。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Motivation: 评估后处理隐私过滤技术在医学AI研究中生成隐私保护合成数据集的有效性，因为这些技术的效果尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 对应用于胸部X光合成的过滤管道进行严格评估，分析其检测训练数据生成的近似重复样本的能力。

Result: 当前过滤器表现出有限的特异性和一致性，仅对真实图像实现高敏感度，但无法可靠检测训练数据生成的近似重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤方法存在关键局限性，可能提供虚假的安全感而无法有效保护患者隐私，需要在过滤器设计方面取得实质性进展才能用于敏感应用。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

TL;DR: 提出Hourglass MLP块，采用宽-窄-宽设计，在扩展维度上进行跳跃连接，通过窄瓶颈进行残差计算，相比传统的窄-宽-窄MLP在生成任务上获得更优的性能-参数帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计惯例，探索在扩展维度上进行跳跃连接的可能性，以利用高维空间进行增量精化，同时通过参数匹配设计保持计算效率。

Method: 提出Hourglass MLP架构，采用宽-窄-宽设计，跳跃连接在扩展维度操作，残差计算通过窄瓶颈流动。初始投影将输入提升到扩展维度，且该投影可在训练期间保持随机初始化不变。

Result: Hourglass架构在图像生成任务上始终优于传统设计，获得更优的帕累托前沿。随着参数预算增加，最优Hourglass配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈，这与传统MLP的缩放模式不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的位置，这一发现可扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多头注意力(MHA)在长序列处理中的二次计算复杂度问题，现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力分数计算所需的FLOPs。

Method: 采用稀疏查询注意力架构，减少查询头数量而非键/值头，直接降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，并提出了多种架构变体。

Result: 在32k-200k token的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算受限场景下实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，在初步小规模实验中模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA是构建更高效可扩展模型的有力工具，在Reactive Transformer架构开发过程中偶然发现，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

Motivation: 当前AutoML方法依赖耗尽的超参数搜索，而预选预测作为一种有前景的替代方案，能够通过智能预选模型来绕过这种搜索，但在文献中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 利用传统模型和大型语言模型(LLM)代理，基于数据集描述和统计信息来减少AutoML搜索空间，应用于AWS AutoGluon投资组合数据集。

Result: 该方法显著减少了计算开销，同时仍能为给定数据集选择最佳模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法改变了AutoML工作流程，在保持模型选择质量的同时大幅降低了计算需求。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕获复杂交互。需要更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用多变量自回归生成模型，在训练时随机采样生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用广义强化策略优化进行稳定策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 该顺序不变强化学习框架在组合优化中表现出优越性能，通过促进搜索空间多样性和关注最相关变量依赖来提高效率。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: 该模型为精准诊断提供了统一的基础框架，有望提高预测准确性并辅助临床决策。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重削弱GNN性能。现有研究主要关注单一缺陷的鲁棒性，缺乏对传统方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，且LLM增强是否始终优于传统方法尚不明确。

Method: 提出了RoGRAD框架，这是首个迭代式检索增强生成范式，通过检索增强生成技术注入类别一致、多样化的增强数据，并通过迭代图对比学习强制学习判别性表示，将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLM增强始终优于传统方法的假设，提出的RoGRAD框架通过动态迭代精炼机制显著提升了图学习的鲁棒性，为图数据增强提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Method: 提出KAIROS非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免了自回归方法的误差累积问题，同时改进了现有非自回归模型过度平滑预测的缺陷。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练的KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的顶级基础模型相当，但推理成本仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: KAIROS强调了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的时间序列预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the

Motivation: 为了解决从最小经验中学习新任务的问题，需要有效重用先前任务的知识，即元学习问题。组合式解决方案特别适合元学习，其中计算元素可以灵活重组为新配置。

Method: 学习一个生成模型来捕获任务族共享的底层组件及其统计特性，将新任务学习转化为概率推断问题，通过高度约束的假设测试找到解决方案，无需参数更新。

Result: 模型成功恢复了规则学习和运动学习任务中的真实组件和统计特性，并展示了从单个示例快速推断新解决方案的能力。

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表现力和概率推断的数据效率，实现了快速的组合式元学习。

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Conclusion: GRACE能够生成可解释的代码奖励函数，在复杂多任务环境中构建复杂奖励API，优于传统模仿学习和在线强化学习方法。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert
demonstrations, but traditional methods yield "black-box" models that are
difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

Motivation: 训练大型语言模型常受限于极端内存需求，其中优化器状态占主导。现有工作通过将梯度投影到低维子空间来降低内存成本，但需要更深入理解梯度空间动态特性。

Method: 分析梯度空间及其子空间动态特性，发现核心子空间影响力变化规律和梯度空间几何特性。基于这些洞察，开发了GrassWalk和GrassJump随机算法，利用子空间特性进行高效优化。

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了核心子空间影响力随时间衰减和梯度空间近平坦曲率的重要特性，基于这些洞察的随机算法能有效解决大模型训练的内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个通过强化学习训练掩码扩散大语言模型的统一框架，旨在同时提升推理质量和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在训练扩散语言模型时存在似然性难以处理的问题，且缺乏对推理效率的优化。

Method: 提出两阶段似然近似与重要性采样校正的强化学习算法，并联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上，相比仅训练模型，获得了更好的准确性和更低的函数评估次数，优化了推理计算效率的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过强化学习有效提升了扩散语言模型的推理质量和速度，实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多自然动态过程只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在高维情况下可扩展性差且需要严格假设。

Method: 扩展了扩散Schrödinger桥匹配，推导了迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，以新的因子化方式处理多边际问题。

Result: 在玩具示例上保留了理论性质，在真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，首次在超高维图像设置中恢复耦合和动态。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥为从静态数据恢复隐藏动态提供了一种实用且原则性的方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled
approach for recovering hidden dynamics from static data.

TL;DR: 提出了ExGRPO框架，通过识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用，显著提升了强化学习验证奖励(RLVR)的效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低下和不稳定。现有研究对经验特性在大推理模型学习动态中的作用探索不足，需要研究什么使推理经验有价值。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架：识别经验价值指标（正确性和熵），组织并优先处理有价值经验，采用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上平均比在线RLVR提升+3.5/7.6分，并在强/弱模型上稳定训练，而在线方法在这些模型上失败。

Conclusion: 原则性经验管理是高效可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过有效经验利用显著提升了推理性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态干扰问题，干扰者采用动态策略选择信道和感知阈值来检测和干扰传输，需要学习避免干扰并优化吞吐率。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL），包括Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，以及深度Q网络（DQN）处理基于接收功率的连续状态，自适应调整传输功率、调制方式和信道选择。

Result: 结果表明强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时仍能维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态频谱干扰的有效方法，能够自适应地优化传输参数以对抗干扰者的动态策略。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

Motivation: Tsetlin Machine作为一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的新型机器学习范式，比神经网络更具可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在大型多通道RGB图像分类中的适用性，同时保持其可解释性优势。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: Tsetlin Machine在复杂大规模训练环境中仍能保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性优势。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将TM应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Motivation: 现有检测LLM幻觉的方法在评估时存在严重分歧，容易被人为夸大性能，需要更稳健的评估框架。

Method: 提出使用多种替代风险指标进行风险相关性实验，包括在QA任务中对多个LLM-as-a-judge变体进行边缘化，以及探索结构化任务、分布外和扰动检测任务。

Conclusion: 使用Elo评级方法可以客观总结不确定性估计算法在广泛评估设置中的表现，提供更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互场景下仍然容易受到对抗攻击，现有方法主要依赖人工红队测试或预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的广阔空间，而研究表明LLM对多轮攻击的脆弱性显著高于单轮攻击。

Method: DialTree-RPO框架，将对话视为顺序决策问题，结合树搜索的在线策略强化学习，无需人工标注数据，系统性地探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上，攻击成功率比现有最优方法提高25.9%以上，并有效发现了新的攻击策略，通过学习优化多轮对话策略来最大化攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自主发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，显著提高了攻击成功率，为LLM安全评估提供了更有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法通过更好地利用低秩流形的几何结构，显著提升了参数高效微调的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

Conclusion: 为未来AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

Conclusion: EqM通过统一平衡景观替代时间条件速度，为流模型和基于能量的模型之间提供了更紧密的桥梁，实现了优化驱动的推理。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

TL;DR: 提出GraphNC框架，通过异常分数分布对齐和扰动正则化来校准图异常检测中的正态性，解决现有半监督方法过拟合标注正常节点的问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误报率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：异常分数分布对齐（ScoreDA）通过对齐教师模型的分数分布来优化异常分数；扰动正态正则化（NormReg）通过在表示空间最小化扰动一致性损失来使正常节点表示更紧凑。

Result: ScoreDA将正常和异常类别的异常分数推向两端，产生更可分离的异常分数；NormReg缓解教师模型不准确分数的误导影响。

Conclusion: GraphNC通过联合利用标注和未标注数据，在异常分数和节点表示空间中校准正态性，有效提升图异常检测性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Motivation: 单流模型在不同类型分布上表现不一致，需要一种能适应多种后验形状和模态的稳健变分推断方法。

Result: 在六种典型后验分布上，AMF-VI相比单流基线获得更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2和MMD指标上表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验族提供稳健变分推断的可靠途径，同时保留每个专家的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

*Klaus-Rudolf Kladny,Bernhard Schölkopf,Michael Muehlebach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PENEX（惩罚指数损失），这是一种新的多类指数损失公式，可进行一阶优化，在理论和实践中都显示出正则化效果，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost使用指数损失在实践中泛化良好，但现有公式难以优化。作者希望开发一个理论上有依据且易于优化的指数损失变体。

Method: 引入PENEX损失函数，通过一阶方法优化，理论证明其能隐式最大化数据点边界，梯度增量隐式参数化boosting框架中的弱学习器。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出正则化效果，通常优于计算成本相似的方法。

Conclusion: PENEX有潜力作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，用于深度神经网络的有效训练和微调。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Method: 使用LSTM、GRU和混合BiLSTM-XGBoost机器学习模型，基于2017-2022年六年的天然气消费和气象数据进行分析和预测。

Result: 混合BiLSTM-XGBoost模型在准确性方面表现最优，具有更低的RMSE、MAPE和MPE值，在数据有限的情况下也表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法特别是混合模型可有效管理和预测天然气消费，提高资源管理效率，减少季节性短缺，地理和气候因素在预测建模中至关重要。

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

TL;DR: DECOR是一个用于线性高斯结构方程模型的联合学习方法，可同时学习DAG和相关的噪声模型，在存在潜在混杂的情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在误差独立时表现良好，而去混杂流程依赖于普遍因子结构或非线性。需要一种能够在存在潜在混杂情况下同时学习有向结构和噪声的方法。

Method: 提出DECOR方法，基于似然估计，完全可微分，交替进行平滑无环图更新和凸噪声更新，可包含轻量弓形互补惩罚或后处理协调步骤。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，DECOR匹配或优于强基线方法，特别在混杂非普遍时表现稳健，在普遍混杂情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混杂的线性高斯SEMs提供了一种有效的结构学习方法，理论保证了全局参数可识别性，实践表现优异。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将扩散模型中的无分类器引导方法扩展到经典策略梯度方法，提出策略梯度引导(PGG)，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现无需重新训练的行为调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导技术应用到强化学习策略梯度方法中，实现测试时的行为控制而不需要重新训练。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，插值条件分支和无条件分支，利用优势估计消除归一化项，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件丢弃在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能持续提升稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导技术可以成功应用于标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了动作触发稀疏可追踪马尔可夫决策过程（ATST-MDPs）框架，针对状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，开发了ST-LSVI-UCB算法，在稀疏观测约束下实现了高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中状态观测往往由动作随机触发，而非每个时间步都能获得观测，这需要新的理论框架来处理稀疏观测约束下的强化学习问题。

Method: 推导了ATST-MDPs的贝尔曼最优方程，引入动作序列学习范式，在线性MDP假设下证明值函数在诱导的动作序列特征映射中具有线性表示，并提出了具有统计误差保证的离策略估计器。

Result: 提出的ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 该工作为在稀疏、动作触发观测下的学习建立了理论基础，证明了在此类观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

*Stefano Bruno,Youngsik Hwang,Jaehyeon An,Sotirios Sabanis,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Flatness-Aware SGLD (fSGLD)方法，通过随机权重扰动来寻找平坦最小值，提升深度学习泛化能力，在保持SGD计算成本的同时达到或优于SAM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SGLD无法偏向平坦最小值，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关。需要设计能有效寻找平坦最小值的优化方法。

Method: fSGLD在每次迭代中使用随机权重扰动后的参数计算随机梯度，优化随机平滑目标函数，隐式捕捉曲率信息。通过适当耦合逆温度和随机扰动尺度，确保不变测度集中在Hessian迹正则化损失函数的全局最小化器附近。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD在Wasserstein距离下具有最佳收敛速率，实验在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中显示fSGLD达到或优于基线算法的泛化和鲁棒性，计算成本仅为SGD水平，约为SAM的一半。Hessian谱分析确认fSGLD收敛到显著更平坦的最小值。

Conclusion: fSGLD提供了一种计算高效的方法来寻找平坦最小值，为随机权重扰动的益处提供了严格理论解释，在保持SGD计算效率的同时实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

*Daniel Gallo Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层和池化操作替代自注意力机制，解决了长序列处理中的二次复杂度问题，在音频处理任务上表现优于现有先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在处理长序列时存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其实际应用。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 使用循环层替代自注意力，引入池化操作减少序列长度。模型采用SkipBlocks递归定义，包含残差块、下池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上池化层等组件。

Result: 池化显著加速训练，改善感知指标（FID和IS），防止过拟合。在原始音频处理任务上优于SaShiMi和Mamba等先进模型。

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案，深层处理长程依赖，浅层处理短期特征。未来可应用于文本、视觉和多模态场景。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染的基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在现实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，发现大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有策略，但部分模型显示出更高回报和更好风险管理的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性，而金融领域对经济价值和高风险决策具有直接相关性，但尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入StockBench基准，让代理接收每日市场信号（价格、基本面、新闻），并做出顺序的买入、卖出或持有决策，使用累计回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 评估最先进的专有和开源模型显示，大多数LLM代理难以超越买入持有基准，但部分模型具有提供更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 在静态金融知识任务中表现出色并不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，这突显了开发LLM驱动的金融代理的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推荐模型假设用户群体同质化，但真实数据由异质群体组成。随着模型规模和复杂度增加，模型会偏向主导分布模式，忽视头部和尾部区域，导致注意力权重不活跃或神经元死亡。

Method: 分析数据集子结构，通过辅助学习暴露具有强分布对比的子结构。利用部分冲突的辅助标签正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上评估，C2AL方法使因子分解机能够捕捉细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过辅助学习有效缓解推荐模型中的分布偏差，在保持全局性能的同时改善了少数群体的学习效果。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Motivation: 扩散生成式插补方法在实践中表现出色，但其在捕捉缺失值与观测值之间复杂时空依赖关系的理论理解仍然有限，需要研究其统计效率和不确定性量化。

Method: 基于条件扩散变换器的条件评分函数近似理论，推导统计样本复杂度界限，构建缺失值的置信区域，并提出混合掩码训练策略。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器在时序数据插补中具有统计效率优势，提出的混合掩码训练策略能有效提升插补性能，为不确定性量化提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边缘分布，无法生成具有现实相关结构的完整联合预测分布。自回归采样虽然能生成相关样本路径，但计算成本极高。

Method: 使用copula方法，在单次前向传递中从多步时间序列基础模型生成相关的样本路径。该方法通过建模变量间的依赖结构来保持时间序列的相关性。

Result: 基于copula的方法比自回归采样快几个数量级，并且通过缓解误差累积现象提高了样本路径的质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的copula方法能够高效生成具有现实相关结构的准确样本路径，为时间序列预测提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持十亿参数级别竞争力的同时，具有相对于上下文长度的线性复杂度。需要比较这两种架构的缩放行为，为未来模型设计和部署提供指导。

Method: 1. 在广泛模型规模(80M-7B)和训练token数量(2B-2T)上，使用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法研究xLSTM在计算最优和过度训练机制中的缩放行为；2. 研究最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；3. 分析推理时缩放特性。

Result: 在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer缩放更有利。重要的是，随着训练和推理上下文的增长，xLSTM的优势会扩大。

Conclusion: xLSTM在缩放特性上优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中，这为未来大语言模型架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Drop-Muon方法，挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的做法，通过随机选择层子集进行更新，结合渐进式训练和非欧几里得更新，实现更高效的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统深度学习优化中每步更新所有层的假设，证明全网络更新在理论和实践中都可能不是最优的，寻求更高效的训练方法。

Method: 引入非欧几里得随机渐进训练方法Drop-Muon，每步只更新随机选择的层子集，结合渐进式训练效率和层特定非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同精度时wall-clock时间快1.4倍，并提供了在层级平滑性和非平滑随机环境下的收敛保证。

Conclusion: 全网络更新只有在特定层平滑常数关系下才是最优的，Drop-Muon为大规模模型训练提供了更高效的理论基础替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了未经修改的Transformer模型能否直接基于笛卡尔坐标预测分子能量和力，无需预定义图结构或物理先验。研究发现Transformer在匹配计算预算下能达到与最先进等变GNN相当的精度，并能自适应学习物理一致的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN使用预定义的图结构（如固定半径截断或k近邻）进行消息传递，这种硬编码的图结构可能限制表达能力（固定感受野）并降低推理速度。本文旨在探索纯Transformer能否在没有图结构或物理先验的情况下学习分子能量和力。

Method: 使用未经修改的标准Transformer模型，直接基于笛卡尔坐标进行训练，不引入预定义的图结构或物理先验。在OMol25数据集上，在匹配的训练计算预算下与最先进的等变GNN进行比较。

Result: Transformer在能量和力预测上达到了与最先进等变GNN相当的均方误差。模型自适应学习了物理一致的模式，如注意力权重与原子间距离成反比衰减，并能灵活适应不同分子环境。Transformer还展现出可预测的训练资源扩展改进。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的许多有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

TL;DR: Diffusion^2是一个基于扩散模型的RF信号传播建模方法，使用3D点云数据在Wi-Fi到毫米波的宽频段范围内预测RF信号传播，误差仅为1.9dB，速度比现有方法快27倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线网络优化至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍具挑战性，因为RF信号会与障碍物发生吸收和反射等相互作用。

Method: 提出Diffusion^2扩散模型方法，使用RF-3D编码器从3D点云数据中提取RF相关特征，并通过多尺度嵌入模拟实际的RF信号传播过程。

Result: 在合成和真实世界测量数据上的评估显示，该方法能准确估计不同频段和环境条件下的RF信号行为，误差仅为1.9dB，速度比现有方法快27倍。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为无线诊断、部署和优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

TL;DR: 提出锚定后验采样(APS)方法，用于预训练离散扩散基础模型的后验采样，解决图像恢复问题而无需重新训练任务特定模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型为分类数据（如文本和图像）提供了统一框架，具有更快推理、更精细控制和无需训练的原则性贝叶斯推理等优势，特别适合后验采样。但现有方法面临无导数引导信号稀疏、连续松弛限制应用、分裂吉布斯采样器维度灾难等挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需训练的样式化和文本引导编辑中进一步展示了其优势，为离散扩散后验采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Method: CNS独特识别扩散模型中与目标概念相关的神经元，以增量方式微调这些概念神经元，并联合保留先前学到的知识。

Result: 在真实数据集评估中，CNS以最少的参数调整实现最先进性能，在单概念和多概念个性化任务中均优于先前方法，且无需融合操作，减少存储和处理时间。

Conclusion: CNS是一种简单有效的持续学习策略，能够高效实现扩散模型的增量个性化，在性能和效率方面都有显著优势。

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's

synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计数据流形的切空间，相比传统LPCA方法在噪声环境下更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LPCA方法在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的临界权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声特征知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO方法利用数据的全局结构指导局部切空间估计，通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间。

Result: 实验表明LEGO产生的切空间估计比LPCA对噪声更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部本征维度估计等下游任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: LEGO方法通过利用全局结构信息，有效解决了高噪声环境下切空间估计的挑战，为数据流形分析提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

Motivation: 显式思维链推理计算成本高且冗余，而潜在推理缺乏有效监督，在复杂自然语言推理中效果有限。

Method: 提出KaVa框架，利用压缩KV缓存作为监督信号，通过自蒸馏将教师模型的KV轨迹知识对齐到潜在推理学生模型中。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了思维链训练的准确性和潜在推理的效率优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多追随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈的在线学习问题，领导者与具有未知类型分布的追随者进行多轮交互，目标是最小化遗憾。在不同反馈设置下设计了学习算法，并提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多追随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈的在线学习版本，其中领导者需要与具有未知类型分布的追随者进行交互，目标是设计能够最小化遗憾的学习算法。

Method: 设计了两种反馈设置下的学习算法：类型反馈（观察追随者类型）和动作反馈（仅观察追随者动作）。使用遗憾最小化框架，针对独立类型分布和一般类型分布分别设计算法。

Result: 在类型反馈下，获得O(√min{Llog(nKAT), nK}·T)（独立分布）和O(√min{Llog(nKAT), K^n}·T)（一般分布）的遗憾上界；在动作反馈下，获得O(min{√n^L K^L A^{2L} L T log T, K^n√T log T})的遗憾上界。同时提供了Ω(√min{L, nK}T)的下界。

Conclusion: 提出的学习算法在不同反馈设置下都能有效处理多追随者贝叶斯Stackelberg博弈，遗憾上界不随追随者数量n呈多项式增长，且下界与上界几乎匹配，证明了算法的有效性。

Abstract: In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed
strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$
possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on
the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning
version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers
with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal
is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility
of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design
learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under
type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round,
we design algorithms that achieve $\mathcal O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), nK
\} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\mathcal
O\big(\sqrt{\min\{L\log(nKA T), K^n \} \cdot T} \big)$ regret for general type
distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial
rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers'
actions, we design algorithms with $\mathcal O( \min\{\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T
\log T}, K^n\sqrt{ T } \log T \} )$ regret. We also provide a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\min\{L, nK\}T})$, almost matching the type-feedback upper
bounds.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了贝叶斯劝说中接收者通过重复交互推断发信者承诺信号方案的情况，分析了发信者相对于已知承诺情况的性能损失，提出了两种可推断信号方案设计方法，并应用于安全警报案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典贝叶斯劝说模型假设接收者知道发信者的承诺，但现实中接收者往往需要通过重复交互来推断信号方案。本文研究这种推断设置下的劝说效果。

Method: 1. 分析发信者在推断设置下的性能损失边界；2. 下界发信者达到近似已知承诺性能所需的样本数；3. 提出两种可推断信号方案设计方法：SGD和有限理性接收者模型优化。

Result: 1. 发信者的性能损失与信号空间大小成正比，与接收者最优行动的区分度成反比；2. 劝说比Stackelberg博弈需要更多样本；3. SGD在低交互场景表现最佳，有限理性模型提供灵活设计方法；4. 在安全警报案例中，SGD找到的信号方案信号更少且使公民行动更易区分。

Conclusion: 在接收者推断信号方案的设置中，发信者可以通过SGD或有限理性接收者模型设计有效的可推断信号方案，这些方案在现实应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: In Bayesian persuasion, an informed sender, who observes a state, commits to
a randomized signaling scheme that guides a self-interested receiver's actions.
Classical models assume the receiver knows the commitment. We, instead, study
the setting where the receiver infers the scheme from repeated interactions. We
bound the sender's performance loss relative to the known-commitment case by a
term that grows with the signal space size and shrinks as the receiver's
optimal actions become more distinct. We then lower bound the samples required
for the sender to approximately achieve their known-commitment performance in
the inference setting. We show that the sender requires more samples in
persuasion compared to the leader in a Stackelberg game, which includes
commitment but lacks signaling. Motivated by these bounds, we propose two
methods for designing inferable signaling schemes, one being stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) on the sender's inference-setting utility, and the other
being optimization with a boundedly-rational receiver model. SGD performs best
in low-interaction regimes, but modeling the receiver as boundedly-rational and
tuning the rationality constant still provides a flexible method for designing
inferable schemes. Finally, we apply SGD to a safety alert example and show it
to find schemes that have fewer signals and make citizens' optimal actions more
distinct compared to the known-commitment case.

TL;DR: 本文研究了公平分配问题中策略性代理的合谋操纵行为，定义了强群体激励比率(SGIR)和群体激励比率(GIR)来衡量合谋操纵的收益，并严格分析了MNW、PS和RR三种机制的SGIR和GIR值。


<details>

Motivation: 虽然已有研究表明基本机制如MNW、PS和RR在个体操纵下的激励比率为2，但代理群体的合谋操纵尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 定义了SGIR和GIR来衡量合谋操纵的收益，其中SGIR是腐败代理激励比率的最大值，GIR是最小值。然后严格分析了MNW、PS和RR三种机制的SGIR和GIR值。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了这三种机制在应对合谋操纵脆弱性方面的根本差异，为理解公平分配机制的抗合谋能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We study fair division problems with strategic agents capable of gaining
advantages by manipulating their reported preferences. Although several
impossibility results have revealed the incompatibility of truthfulness with
standard fairness criteria, subsequent works have circumvented this limitation
through the incentive ratio framework. Previous studies demonstrate that
fundamental mechanisms like Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) and Probabilistic Serial
(PS) for divisible goods, and Round-Robin (RR) for indivisible goods achieve an
incentive ratio of $2$, implying that no individual agent can gain more than
double his truthful utility through manipulation. However, collusive
manipulation by agent groups remains unexplored.
  In this work, we define strong group incentive ratio (SGIR) and group
incentive ratio (GIR) to measure the gain of collusive manipulation, where SGIR
and GIR are respectively the maximum and minimum of the incentive ratios of
corrupted agents. Then, we tightly characterize the SGIRs and GIRs of MNW, PS,
and RR. In particular, the GIR of MNW is $2$ regardless of the coalition size.
Moreover, for coalition size $c \geq 1$, the SGIRs of MNW and PS, and the GIRs
of PS and RR are $c + 1$. Finally, the SGIR of RR is unbounded for coalition
size $c \geq 2$. Our results reveal fundamental differences of these three
mechanisms in their vulnerability to collusion.

Conclusion: 提出的算法为TU合作游戏的核心近似提供了一种有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel algorithm to approximate the core of transferable
utility (TU) cooperative games via linear programming. Given the computational
hardness of determining the full core, our approach provides a tractable
approximation by sampling extreme points through randomized linear problems

its effectiveness through extensive simulations on various game models. Our
results show that the method is scalable and achieves high accuracy in terms of
core reconstruction.

Motivation: 研究群体行为在贝叶斯博弈中的表现，解决群体内合作与非合作情境下的最优策略问题。

Method: 提出多群体贝叶斯博弈模型，将其转换为多群体事前代理博弈，利用势博弈性质寻找均衡解。

Result: 给出了寻找多群体贝叶斯纳什均衡的充分必要条件，并提供了相应的算法。

Conclusion: 通过转换方法和势博弈理论，有效解决了多群体贝叶斯博弈的均衡求解问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a model of multi-group Bayesian games (MBGs) to describe
the group behavior in Bayesian games, and gives methods to find (strongly)
multi-group Bayesian Nash equilibria (MBNE) of this model with a proposed
transformation. MBNE represent the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the
situation where players within a group play a cooperative game, while strongly
MBNE characterize the optimal strategy \textit{profiles} under the situation
where players within a group play a noncooperative game. Firstly, we propose a
model of MBGs and give a transformation to convert any MBG into a multi-group
ex-ante agent game (MEAG) which is a normal-form game. Secondly, we give a
sufficient and necessary condition for a MBG's MEAG to be (strongly) potential.
If it is (strongly) potential, all its (strongly) Nash equilibria can be found,
and then all (strongly) MBNE of the MBG can be obtained by leveraging the
transformation's good properties. Finally, we provide algorithms for finding
(strongly) MBNE of a MBG whose MEAG is (strongly) potential and use an
illustrative example to verify the correctness of our results.

*Ivo Silva,Pedro Nogueira,Guilherme Bonaldo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种地理感知的嵌入框架，通过多层级H3网格和双塔神经网络架构来解决住房推荐中的稀疏性和空间细微差别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在拉丁美洲最大的住房平台QuintoAndar上，用户难以找到理想住房，而地理位置对房产价值、便利设施和生活质量有重要影响。将位置信息融入推荐系统对推荐效果至关重要。

Method: 使用分层H3网格在多个级别上集成到双塔神经网络架构中，通过多分辨率空间编码来捕捉地理位置信息。

Result: 嵌入评估显示获得了更丰富和平衡的嵌入表示，离线排名模拟表明推荐质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 地理感知嵌入框架能有效解决住房推荐中的空间稀疏性问题，显著提高推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: QuintoAndar Group is Latin America's largest housing platform,
revolutionizing property rentals and sales. Headquartered in Brazil, it
simplifies the housing process by eliminating paperwork and enhancing
accessibility for tenants, buyers, and landlords. With thousands of houses
available for each city, users struggle to find the ideal home. In this
context, location plays a pivotal role, as it significantly influences property
value, access to amenities, and life quality. A great location can make even a
modest home highly desirable. Therefore, incorporating location into
recommendations is essential for their effectiveness. We propose a geo-aware
embedding framework to address sparsity and spatial nuances in housing
recommendations on digital rental platforms. Our approach integrates an
hierarchical H3 grid at multiple levels into a two-tower neural architecture.
We compare our method with a traditional matrix factorization baseline and a
single-resolution variant using interaction data from our platform. Embedding
specific evaluation reveals richer and more balanced embedding representations,
while offline ranking simulations demonstrate a substantial uplift in
recommendation quality.

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型从复杂数据自动生成图表的能力，发现数据检索和处理是最大挑战，但通过适当的脚手架和反馈机制可以显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在虚假信息和偏见信息泛滥的时代，可靠数据源的可访问性至关重要。国家统计机构提供的数据通常分散在多个表格中，普通用户难以处理，导致这些开放数据实际上难以访问

Method: 使用荷兰统计局的不同公共数据，评估多个LLM在识别相关数据表、执行必要操作和自动生成可视化方面的能力。提出了包含数据检索与预处理、代码质量和视觉表示三个维度的评估框架

Result: 定位和处理正确数据是最主要的挑战。LLM很少在没有明确指导的情况下实施可视化最佳实践。当提供有效图表设计信息时，模型在表示分数上有显著改进。采用迭代自评估的代理方法在所有评估维度上都表现出色

Conclusion: 通过适当的脚手架和反馈机制可以增强LLM在自动图表生成方面的有效性，系统已经能够在三个评估维度上达到必要的准确性

Abstract: In this time when biased information, deep fakes, and propaganda proliferate,
the accessibility of reliable data sources is more important than ever.
National statistical institutes provide curated data that contain quantitative
information on a wide range of topics. However, that information is typically
spread across many tables and the plain numbers may be arduous to process.
Hence, this open data may be practically inaccessible. We ask the question "Are
current Generative AI models capable of facilitating the identification of the
right data and the fully-automatic creation of charts to provide information in
visual form, corresponding to user queries?". We present a structured
evaluation of recent large language models' (LLMs) capabilities to generate
charts from complex data in response to user queries. Working with diverse
public data from Statistics Netherlands, we assessed multiple LLMs on their
ability to identify relevant data tables, perform necessary manipulations, and
generate appropriate visualizations autonomously. We propose a new evaluation
framework spanning three dimensions: data retrieval & pre-processing, code
quality, and visual representation. Results indicate that locating and
processing the correct data represents the most significant challenge.
Additionally, LLMs rarely implement visualization best practices without
explicit guidance. When supplemented with information about effective chart
design, models showed marked improvement in representation scores. Furthermore,
an agentic approach with iterative self-evaluation led to excellent performance
across all evaluation dimensions. These findings suggest that LLMs'
effectiveness for automated chart generation can be enhanced through
appropriate scaffolding and feedback mechanisms, and that systems can already
reach the necessary accuracy across the three evaluation dimensions.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的音乐推荐系统，通过工具调用统一检索-重排序流程，支持多种检索方法（布尔过滤、稀疏检索、密集检索、生成式检索）的智能组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统主要依赖自然语言交互，未能充分利用元数据过滤等关键组件，限制了推荐能力。

Method: 使用LLM作为端到端推荐系统，通过工具调用规划来协调专用组件：布尔过滤器（SQL）、稀疏检索（BM25）、密集检索（嵌入相似性）和生成式检索（语义ID）。

Result: 该统一工具调用框架在不同推荐场景中达到竞争性性能，能根据用户查询选择性使用合适的检索方法。

Conclusion: 为对话式音乐推荐系统开创了新范式，通过工具规划实现多模态支持和多种数据库过滤方法的无缝集成。

Abstract: While the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have
successfully enabled generative recommenders with natural language
interactions, their recommendation behavior is limited, leaving other simpler
yet crucial components such as metadata or attribute filtering underutilized in
the system. We propose an LLM-based music recommendation system with tool
calling to serve as a unified retrieval-reranking pipeline. Our system
positions an LLM as an end-to-end recommendation system that interprets user
intent, plans tool invocations, and orchestrates specialized components:
boolean filters (SQL), sparse retrieval (BM25), dense retrieval (embedding
similarity), and generative retrieval (semantic IDs). Through tool planning,
the system predicts which types of tools to use, their execution order, and the
arguments needed to find music matching user preferences, supporting diverse
modalities while seamlessly integrating multiple database filtering methods. We
demonstrate that this unified tool-calling framework achieves competitive
performance across diverse recommendation scenarios by selectively employing
appropriate retrieval methods based on user queries, envisioning a new paradigm
for conversational music recommendation systems.

TL;DR: MetaSynth是一个多智能体检索增强生成框架，通过从隐式搜索反馈中学习来优化元标题和描述，在电子商务数据上显著提升了点击率和排名指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 元标题和描述在搜索和推荐平台中对用户参与度有重要影响，但现有方法存在多样性不足、产生幻觉属性或忽略历史成功案例等问题，缺乏直接利用可观察结果的隐式信号的能力。

Method: MetaSynth构建了一个来自顶级排名结果的范例库，基于产品内容和范例生成候选片段，并通过评估器-生成器循环迭代优化输出，确保相关性、推广强度和合规性。

Result: 在专有电子商务数据和Amazon评论语料库上，MetaSynth在NDCG、MRR和排名指标上均优于强基线方法，大规模A/B测试进一步展示了10.26%的点击率和7.51%的点击量提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅优化了元数据，还贡献了一个在黑盒系统中使用隐式信号优化内容的通用范式。

Abstract: Meta titles and descriptions strongly shape engagement in search and
recommendation platforms, yet optimizing them remains challenging. Search
engine ranking models are black box environments, explicit labels are
unavailable, and feedback such as click-through rate (CTR) arrives only
post-deployment. Existing template, LLM, and retrieval-augmented approaches
either lack diversity, hallucinate attributes, or ignore whether candidate
phrasing has historically succeeded in ranking. This leaves a gap in directly
leveraging implicit signals from observable outcomes. We introduce MetaSynth, a
multi-agent retrieval-augmented generation framework that learns from implicit
search feedback. MetaSynth builds an exemplar library from top-ranked results,
generates candidate snippets conditioned on both product content and exemplars,
and iteratively refines outputs via evaluator-generator loops that enforce
relevance, promotional strength, and compliance. On both proprietary e-commerce
data and the Amazon Reviews corpus, MetaSynth outperforms strong baselines
across NDCG, MRR, and rank metrics. Large-scale A/B tests further demonstrate
10.26% CTR and 7.51% clicks. Beyond metadata, this work contributes a general
paradigm for optimizing content in black-box systems using implicit signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架主要关注网络搜索，忽视本地私有数据，导致私有数据检索效率低且不符合FAIR原则，造成效率低下和可重用性有限的问题。

Method: 将异构资源封装为FAIR合规数字对象，细化为原子知识单元和知识图谱，形成异构图索引用于多粒度检索，并构建多代理系统支持问答和报告生成。

Result: 在检索、问答和报告写作任务上的实验结果显示，IoDResearch持续超越代表性的RAG和深度研究基线方法。

Conclusion: IoDResearch证明了在IoD范式下私有数据为中心的深度研究的可行性，为更可信、可重用和自动化的科学发现铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multi-source, heterogeneous, and multimodal scientific
data has increasingly exposed the limitations of traditional data management.
Most existing DeepResearch (DR) efforts focus primarily on web search while
overlooking local private data. Consequently, these frameworks exhibit low
retrieval efficiency for private data and fail to comply with the FAIR
principles, ultimately resulting in inefficiency and limited reusability. To
this end, we propose IoDResearch (Internet of Data Research), a private
data-centric Deep Research framework that operationalizes the Internet of Data
paradigm. IoDResearch encapsulates heterogeneous resources as FAIR-compliant
digital objects, and further refines them into atomic knowledge units and
knowledge graphs, forming a heterogeneous graph index for multi-granularity
retrieval. On top of this representation, a multi-agent system supports both
reliable question answering and structured scientific report generation.
Furthermore, we establish the IoD DeepResearch Benchmark to systematically
evaluate both data representation and Deep Research capabilities in IoD
scenarios. Experimental results on retrieval, QA, and report-writing tasks show
that IoDResearch consistently surpasses representative RAG and Deep Research
baselines. Overall, IoDResearch demonstrates the feasibility of
private-data-centric Deep Research under the IoD paradigm, paving the way
toward more trustworthy, reusable, and automated scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出一种数据中心的解决方案，通过使用从完整用户查询生成的合成前缀来减轻实时神经查询自动完成系统中的呈现偏差，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时查询自动完成系统中存在的呈现偏差问题，即模型建议会影响用户行为，导致收集的参与信号存在固有偏差。

Method: 从非自动完成会话中收集完整用户查询生成合成前缀，丰富训练数据；开发适用于实时部署的神经排序器，包含查询流行度、季节性、模糊匹配分数等丰富特征；引入针对任务简化的列表损失，将计算复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n)。

Result: 在大规模电商环境中部署，系统在用户参与度方面显示出统计显著的改进，通过平均倒数排名等指标衡量。

Conclusion: 合成前缀不仅提高了泛化能力，还为其他低延迟排序任务（包括相关搜索和查询推荐）中的偏差缓解提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in
real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic
prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected
during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows
us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse
and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement
signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model
suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for
real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich
set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores,
and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical
alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we
introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing
computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query
autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix.
Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates
statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean
reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes
not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias
mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and
query recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的推荐系统存在三个主要问题：使用静态快照无法捕捉快速变化的用户偏好；忽略视觉和音频等多模态内容；缺乏基于具体证据的可信解释。

Method: 1. 在线适应机制：通过轻量级模块持续整合新用户交互，避免重新训练大模型
2. 统一表示：将协同信号与视觉、音频特征无缝结合，处理模态缺失情况
3. 解释系统：基于具体协同模式和物品属性生成可验证的自然语言理由

Result: 该方法在保持基础模型冻结效率的同时，仅增加最小计算开销，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: \model{}框架有效解决了LLM推荐系统中的动态适应性、多模态融合和可信解释等关键挑战，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation
tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text
prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising
approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM
representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive
fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several
challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static
snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items
contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current
systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete
evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these
limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation
mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through
lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a
unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with
visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be
unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds
recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes,
producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains
the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational
overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in
handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing
transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced
generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through
five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented
generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable
recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our
framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while
incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual
knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous
model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent
improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to
existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in
NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了从粗粒度用户评分中恢复细粒度物品排序的问题，证明了在分数和阈值均为潜在变量的情况下，实现近乎完美的排序需要Θ(n²)用户，远高于基于比较的排序所需的O(n log n)复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索和推荐系统中，用户输入通常以粗粒度离散评分形式出现，但系统需要恢复物品的细粒度排序。现有方法无法有效处理分数和用户阈值均为潜在变量的情况。

Method: 将物品建模为具有分数，用户建模为具有阈值；当物品分数超过用户阈值时获得正面评分。用户按顺序到达，每个新用户可被查询以改进当前排序。

Result: 证明实现Spearman距离度量的近乎完美排序需要Θ(n²)用户，这反映了识别具有适当阈值的用户所需的额外查询成本。边界还通过二次散度因子量化了分数与阈值分布不匹配的影响。

Conclusion: 在线排序中存在一个张力：阈值多样性对于将多个用户的粗粒度评分合并为细粒度排序是必要的，但如果阈值先验未知，这种多样性会带来成本。

Abstract: Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender
systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on
a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a
fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as
having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively
if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on
the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores
and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally
partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside
each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can
be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a
near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\Theta(n^2)$
users (and therefore $\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than
the $O(n\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the
additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate
thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score
and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the
tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity
matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in
online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings
from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if
the thresholds are a priori unknown.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力权重的重排序系统中，并非所有注意力头都同等重要，许多头会产生噪声和冗余，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入CoRe heads方法，使用对比评分指标识别出对相关文档关注度高、对不相关文档关注度低的注意力头，这些头构成最具有区分性的重排序头集合。

Result: 在三个大语言模型上的实验表明，仅使用不到1%的注意力头就能显著提升重排序精度，且CoRe heads主要集中在中间层，修剪后50%的模型层可以在保持精度的同时显著减少推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: CoRe heads方法通过识别和利用最相关的注意力头，实现了高效且准确的重排序系统，同时通过层修剪进一步优化了计算效率。

Abstract: The strong zero-shot and long-context capabilities of recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) have paved the way for highly effective re-ranking systems.
Attention-based re-rankers leverage attention weights from transformer heads to
produce relevance scores, but not all heads are created equally: many
contribute noise and redundancy, thus limiting performance. To address this, we
introduce CoRe heads, a small set of retrieval heads identified via a
contrastive scoring metric that explicitly rewards high attention heads that
correlate with relevant documents, while downplaying nodes with higher
attention that correlate with irrelevant documents. This relative ranking
criterion isolates the most discriminative heads for re-ranking and yields a
state-of-the-art list-wise re-ranker. Extensive experiments with three LLMs
show that aggregated signals from CoRe heads, constituting less than 1% of all
heads, substantially improve re-ranking accuracy over strong baselines. We
further find that CoRe heads are concentrated in middle layers, and pruning the
computation of final 50% of model layers preserves accuracy while significantly
reducing inference time and memory usage.

Motivation: 原始Promptagator方法依赖专有的大规模LLM，用户可能无法访问或无法用于敏感数据。本研究旨在探索参数规模≤14B的开源LLM作为替代方案的影响。

Method: 使用参数规模≤14B的开源LLM作为Promptagator式查询生成器，为领域专用密集检索模型的微调生成任务特定查询。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从业者提供了合成数据生成的可靠替代方案，并为最大化领域特定应用的微调结果提供了见解。

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot
prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning
domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator
approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have
access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we
study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B
parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as
small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query
generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable
alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize
fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

a root, and $k$ terminals, each of which has a monochromatic path to the root.
Our goal is to find an arborescence in which every terminal has a path to the
root, and its path does not switch colors too many times. We give an efficient
algorithm that finds such a solution with at most $2\log_{4/3}k$ color
switches. Up to constant factors this is the best possible universal bound, as
there are graphs requiring at least $\log_2 k$ color switches.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时序图的实现问题，给定路径度量矩阵（持续时间、长度或最早到达时间），判断是否存在满足该矩阵的时序图。分析了严格/非严格路径、周期/非周期时序图、边标签数受限等多种设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图在现实世界中广泛应用，但给定路径度量矩阵后判断是否存在对应时序图的问题尚未充分研究，特别是对于最短和最早到达时间路径。

Method: 通过分析不同设置下的时序图实现问题：严格/非严格路径、周期/非周期时序图、边标签数受限等，使用参数化复杂度分析和多项式时间算法设计。

Result: 对于最早到达时间，在周期和非周期时序图中都能获得多项式时间算法；当矩阵包含值集合时，问题变为NP难，但可为多值条目数小的实例设计FPT算法；对于最快路径，获得了关于顶点覆盖数的新硬度结果；对于最短路径，周期版本多项式可解而非周期版本NP难。

Conclusion: 时序图实现问题的复杂度高度依赖于路径度量和时序图设置，最早到达时间相对容易处理，而最快和最短路径在非周期设置下更具挑战性。

Abstract: In this work, we follow the current trend on temporal graph realization,
where one is given a property P and the goal is to determine whether there is a
temporal graph, that is, a graph where the edge set changes over time, with
property P . We consider the problems where as property P , we are given a
prescribed matrix for the duration, length, or earliest arrival time of
pairwise temporal paths. That is, we are given a matrix D and ask whether there
is a temporal graph such that for any ordered pair of vertices (s, t), Ds,t
equals the duration (length, or earliest arrival time, respectively) of any
temporal path from s to t minimizing that specific temporal path metric. For
shortest and earliest arrival temporal paths, we are the first to consider
these problems as far as we know. We analyze these problems for many settings
like: strict and non-strict paths, periodic and non-periodic temporal graphs,
and limited number of labels per edge (that is, limited occurrence number per
edge over time). In contrast to all other path metrics, we show that for the
earliest arrival times, we can achieve polynomial-time algorithms in periodic
and non-periodic temporal graphs and for strict and and non-strict paths.
However, the problem becomes NP-hard when the matrix does not contain a single
integer but a set or range of possible allowed values. As we show, the problem
can still be solved efficiently in this scenario, when the number of entries
with more than one value is small, that is, we develop an FPT-algorithm for the
number of such entries. For the setting of fastest paths, we achieve new
hardness results that answers an open question by Klobas, Mertzios, Molter, and
Spirakis [Theor. Comput. Sci. '25] about the parameterized complexity of the
problem with respect to the vertex cover number and significantly improves over
a previous hardness result for the feedback vertex set number. When considering
shortest paths, we show that the periodic versions are polynomial-time solvable
whereas the non-periodic versions become NP-hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ℓ_p回归算法在理论和实践之间存在差距，复杂算法理论性能好但实现困难，而简单算法性能不足。

Method: 采用原始-对偶框架，通过维护对偶目标的不变量自然推导更新规则，使用轻量级迭代方案。

Result: 算法在迭代复杂度上达到最优，显著优于Adil-Peng-Sachdeva的IRLS算法和MATLAB/CVX实现。

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了ℓ_p回归问题理论和实践算法之间的差距，提供了既高效又易于实现的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce fast algorithms for solving $\ell_{p}$ regression problems using
the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art iteration complexity, outperforming the IRLS algorithm by
Adil-Peng-Sachdeva (NeurIPS 2019) and matching the theoretical bounds
established by the complex algorithm of Adil-Kyng-Peng-Sachdeva (SODA 2019, J.
ACM 2024) via a simpler lightweight iterative scheme. This bridges the existing
gap between theoretical and practical algorithms for $\ell_{p}$ regression. Our
algorithms depart from prior approaches, using a primal-dual framework, in
which the update rule can be naturally derived from an invariant maintained for
the dual objective. Empirically, we show that our algorithms significantly
outperform both the IRLS algorithm by Adil-Peng-Sachdeva and MATLAB/CVX
implementations.

*Alexander E. Black,Christian Nöbel,Raphael Steiner*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文证明了在线性规划中近似最短单调电路行走问题的NP困难性，对于m边多边形，任何O(m^{1-ε})的近似比都是NP困难的，这几乎是可能的最佳下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电路增强方案是线性规划的组合算法族，推广了单纯形法。之前的研究表明寻找最短单调电路行走的2-近似是NP困难的，但基于高度退化多面体的构造。本文旨在显著加强这些硬度结果。

Method: 通过构造多边形实例，证明对于任意固定ε>0，在m边多边形上近似最短单调电路行走达到O(m^{1-ε})因子是NP困难的。

Result: 证明了该近似问题的强NP困难性，结果本质上是可能的最佳下界，因为无法改进到o(m)以下。这一结果对简单多面体和固定维度也成立。

Conclusion: 在线性规划中近似最短单调电路行走问题具有极强的计算困难性，即使在简单多边形情况下，任何非平凡近似都是NP困难的。

Abstract: Circuit augmentation schemes are a family of combinatorial algorithms for
linear programming that generalize the simplex method. To solve the linear
program, they construct a so-called monotone circuit walk: They start at an
initial vertex of the feasible region and traverse a discrete sequence of
points on the boundary, while moving along certain allowed directions
(circuits) and improving the objective function at each step until reaching an
optimum. Since the existence of short circuit walks has been conjectured
(Circuit Diameter Conjecture), several works have investigated how well one can
efficiently approximate shortest monotone circuit walks towards an optimum. A
first result addressing this question was given by De Loera, Kafer, and
Sanit\`a [SIAM J. Opt., 2022], who showed that given as input an LP and the
starting vertex, finding a $2$-approximation for this problem is NP-hard.
Cardinal and the third author [Math. Prog. 2023] gave a stronger lower bound
assuming the exponential time hypothesis, showing that even an approximation
factor of $O(\frac{\log m}{\log \log m})$ is intractable for LPs defined by $m$
inequalities. Both of these results were based on reductions from highly
degenerate polytopes in combinatorial optimization with high dimension.
  In this paper, we significantly strengthen the aforementioned hardness
results by showing that for every fixed $\varepsilon>0$ approximating the
problem on polygons with $m$ edges to within a factor of $O(m^{1-\varepsilon})$
is NP-hard. This result is essentially best-possible, as it cannot be improved
beyond $o(m)$. In particular, this implies hardness for simple polytopes and in
fixed dimension.

*Chetwin Low,Weimin Wang,Calder Katyal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Ovi是一个统一的音视频生成范式，通过双DiT模块的块状跨模态融合，将音频和视频建模为单一生成过程，实现自然同步和电影级视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音视频生成方法依赖复杂的多阶段架构或顺序合成，需要独立的流水线或后处理对齐，Ovi旨在通过统一范式解决这些问题。

Method: 使用块状跨模态融合的双DiT模块，通过缩放RoPE嵌入交换时间信息和双向交叉注意力交换语义信息，在大型视频语料库上联合训练相同的视频和音频塔。

Result: 模型能够生成具有自然语音和准确上下文匹配音效的电影级视频片段，音频塔能够生成逼真的音效以及传达丰富说话人身份和情感的语音。

Conclusion: Ovi提供了一个统一的音视频生成框架，消除了对独立流水线或后处理对齐的需求，实现了自然同步的音频视频生成。

Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures
or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified
paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single
generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules,
Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate
pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion
modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that
of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of
thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic
sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and
emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio
towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and
semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our
model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate,
context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the
demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 对比对比损失和三元组损失在深度度量学习中的表现，发现三元组损失能更好地保留类内和类间方差，支持更细粒度的表示学习，并在多个数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比损失和三元组损失是深度度量学习中广泛使用的目标函数，但它们对表示质量的影响尚未得到充分理解，需要从理论和实验角度进行系统比较。

Method: 通过理论分析和在合成数据、MNIST、CIFAR-10等真实数据集上的任务特定实验，考察类内/类间方差和优化行为（如贪婪更新），分析损失衰减率、活跃率和梯度范数等指标。

Result: 三元组损失在类内和类间保留了更大的方差，支持更细粒度的区分；在优化动态方面，对比损失早期产生许多小更新，而三元组损失产生较少但更强的更新，能持续学习困难样本；在分类和检索任务中，三元组损失在MNIST、CIFAR-10、CUB-200和CARS196数据集上均表现更优。

Conclusion: 建议使用三元组损失来保留细节和关注困难样本，使用对比损失进行更平滑、基于广泛的嵌入细化。

Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric
learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently
understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses,
focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g.,
greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on
synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss
preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained
distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss
tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic
differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining
loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss
drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but
stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both
classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196
datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior
performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and
hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding
refinement.

Conclusion: 提出的MCMC-based AI驱动架构为MIMO接收器处理提供了可解释、可扩展和灵活的解决方案，能够应对下一代无线通信网络的挑战。

Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key
technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it
faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the
number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of
next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing
these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver
architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike
existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our
MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable
to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection,
and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability,
and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed
approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby
enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be
seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the
development of fully intelligent communication receivers.

Abstract: DNA strings and their properties are widely studied since last 20 years due
to its applications in DNA computing. In this area, one designs a set of DNA
strings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and
combinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement
constraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent
applications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints
on DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of
non-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint.
Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed
constraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement,
$GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem
repeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are
constructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and
combinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring
and a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA
codes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic
constructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields
DNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We
briefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance
etc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that
satisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about
algebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present
some open research directions in this area.

work, we study the problem of list decoding for a general class of polynomial
evaluation codes, also known as Toric codes, that are defined for any given

Conclusion: EP树表示有效支持并行解码，显著降低延迟同时保持ML最优性，为高效通用解码器设计提供新途径。

Abstract: Advances in parallel hardware platforms have motivated the development of
efficient universal decoders capable of meeting stringent throughput and
latency requirements. Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a
recently proposed decoding paradigm that sequentially tests Error Patterns
(EPs) until finding a valid codeword. While Soft GRAND (SGRAND) achieves
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding, its inherently sequential nature hinders
parallelism and results in high decoding latency. In this work, we utilize a
unified binary tree representation of EPs, termed the EP tree, which enables
compact representation, efficient manipulation, and parallel exploration.
Building upon this EP tree representation, we propose a parallel design of
SGRAND, preserving its ML optimality while significantly reducing decoding
latency through pruning strategies and tree-based computation. Furthermore, we
develop a hybrid GRAND algorithm that enhances Ordered Reliability Bits (ORB)
GRAND with the EP tree representation, thereby achieving ML decoding with
minimal additional computational cost beyond ORBGRAND while retaining parallel
efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that parallel SGRAND achieves a
$3.75\times$ acceleration compared to serial implementation, while the hybrid
enhanced method achieves a $4.8\times$ acceleration, with further gains
expected under hardware mapping.

Conclusion: 本文成功推导了BCH码维数和Bose距离的显式公式，扩展了设计的距离范围，为BCH码的参数研究提供了新的工具和见解。

Abstract: BCH codes are important error correction codes, widely utilized due to their
robust algebraic structure, multi-error correcting capability, and efficient
decoding algorithms. Despite their practical importance and extensive study,
their parameters, including dimension, minimum distance and Bose distance,
remain largely unknown in general. This paper addresses this challenge by
investigating the dimension and Bose distance of BCH codes of length $(q^m -
1)/\lambda$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\lambda$ is a positive
divisor of $q - 1$. Specifically, for narrow-sense BCH codes of this length
with $m \geq 4$, we derive explicit formulas for their dimension for designed
distance $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}
+ 1$. We also provide explicit formulas for their Bose distance in the range $2
\leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}$. These
ranges for $\delta$ are notably larger than the previously known results for
this class of BCH codes. Furthermore, we extend these findings to determine the
dimension and Bose distance for certain non-narrow-sense BCH codes of the same
length. Applying our results, we identify several BCH codes with good
parameters.

Conclusion: 所提出的RIS辅助NOMA通信框架和RUOM算法能有效提升无人机网络的通信性能和资源利用效率。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of downlink non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) communication in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks enhanced
by partitionable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We analyze three
types of links between base station (BS) and UAVs: direct, RIS-only indirect,
and composite links, under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS)
propagation. The RIS-only indirect link and direct link are modeled using
double Nakagami-m and Nakagami-m fading, respectively, while the composite link
follows a combined fading channel model. Closed-form expressions for the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are derived for all links, enabling tractable outage probability
analysis. Then, we formulate a fairness-efficiency bilevel optimization problem
to minimize the maximum outage probability among UAVs while minimizing the
total number of required RIS reflecting elements. Accordingly, an RIS-assisted
UAV Outage Minimization (RUOM) algorithm is proposed, which fairly allocates
the NOMA power coefficients while minimizing the total number of RIS reflecting
elements required, subject to NOMA-defined constraints, RIS resource
limitations, and maximum allowable outage threshold. Simulation results
validate the analytical models and demonstrate that the proposed RUOM algorithm
significantly improves fairness and efficiency in BS-UAV communication.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.

Conclusion: 里德堡原子接收器在检测8-PAM信号时表现出优越性能，能够有效抑制干扰，提供比传统接收器更低的符号错误率。

Abstract: Quantum sensing has attracted significant attention due to its ability to
measure physical quantities with extremely high accuracy. Rydberg atoms -
typically alkali atoms with a highly excited valence electron that is far from
the nucleus - exhibit strong sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields.
This sensitivity leads to coupling between different atomic energy levels,
which can be observed by monitoring changes in a control laser beam before and
after it passes through a vapor cell containing the Rydberg atoms. By analyzing
the transmitted laser signal with a photodetector, variations in transmission
can be attributed to the presence and characteristics of the external
electromagnetic field. Because Rydberg atoms operate in a highly excited
quantum state without relying on traditional electronic circuitry, they
inherently avoid thermal noise, thereby enabling more sensitive detection. In
this paper, we investigate the performance of a Rydberg atomic receiver based
on Rb-85 and compare it with that of a conventional receiver in detecting an
8-level pulse amplitude modulation (8-PAM) signal in the presence of
off-resonant interference. We demonstrate that the Rydberg receiver can
suppress interference without the need for an additional filter. Effectively,
our results show that the Rydberg receiver serves as an integrated filter and
demodulator, outperforming conventional circuit-based receivers in terms of
achievable symbol error rate

*Mateus P. Mota,Mattia Merluzzi,Emilio Calvanese Strinati*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合考虑语义信息相关性和信道状态的协作边缘推理方法，通过使注意力权重依赖于信道信息来改进设备分组协作，在恶劣传播条件下优于仅考虑语义或信道状态的分离方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在数据损坏的无线环境中，多个设备协作可以提高推理性能。但无线信道损伤会影响特征通信，仅考虑语义相关性或信道状态的分离方法在恶劣传播条件下表现不佳。

Method: 使用键-查询机制进行选择性信息交换，提出联合方法使注意力权重依赖于信道信息，综合考虑语义信息相关性和信道状态来分组设备进行协作。

Result: 数值模拟显示，联合方法在损坏数据上的推理性能优于本地推理，也优于仅考虑应用层或物理层参数的分离协作推理方法。

Conclusion: 在无线协作边缘推理中，联合考虑语义相关性和信道状态的方法比分离方法更有效，特别是在恶劣传播条件下。

Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables
multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence
of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information
exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of
wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a
disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or
channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation
conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes
into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping
devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of
the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the
joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared
to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider
application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究边缘设备间的协作推理框架，通过交换中间特征而非原始数据来提高分类精度，重点探讨了信道噪声影响、协作点选择和通信-精度权衡优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备协作推理需要平衡精度和带宽限制，现有方法缺乏对信道噪声、协作点选择和通信效率的系统分析。

Method: 基于键-查询机制进行选择性信息交换，分析信道噪声对特征通信的影响，研究不同中间协作点对性能的影响，并探索通信剪枝策略。

Result: 中间协作方法对信道错误具有鲁棒性，查询传输比数据传输本身需要更高的可靠性，能够优化精度同时最小化资源使用。

Conclusion: 协作推理框架通过选择合适的协作点和通信策略，可以在保持高精度的同时有效管理通信资源，对信道噪声具有良好鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge
ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve
classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw
observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to
balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism
for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference
by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of
intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off
across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect
performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to
optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the
intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the
query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data
transmission itself.

Motivation: 解决闭源API在运筹学任务中的隐私问题，同时避免从头训练开源模型的高计算成本。

Method: 使用半自动数据合成管道生成多样化运筹学问题-答案对，通过微调Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型并增强外部求解器API调用能力。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上达到80.1%执行准确率，比同规模基线提高4.3%以上；在两种未见问题类型的零样本评估中获得54%平均准确率，比最强基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 验证了工具增强微调LLMs在准确且可泛化的运筹学问题建模和求解中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ROTE算法通过将人类行为建模为行为程序而非信念驱动的策略，结合LLM生成假设空间和概率推理处理不确定性，在稀疏观测下预测人类行为，性能优于基线方法50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算成本过高难以快速适应。日常社交互动往往遵循可预测的认知节省模式（"脚本"），这为高效预测提供了机会。

Method: 将日常行为建模为计算机代码形式的行为程序，提出ROTE算法：使用LLM合成行为程序的假设空间，结合概率推理处理该空间的不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和大规模家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE从稀疏观测中预测人类和AI行为，在样本内准确性和样本外泛化方面比行为克隆和LLM基线方法提升高达50%。

Conclusion: 将动作理解视为程序合成问题，ROTE为AI系统在现实世界中高效有效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Motivation: 现有AI系统在跨学科合作和探索未知问题方面存在局限，需要构建能够自主进化和发现科学知识的智能系统。

Method: 集成领域知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体，构建了一个能够进行深度专业推理和高效跨学科协作的智能生态系统。

Result: 知识库增强机制使所有七个专家智能体的对话质量得分平均提高10-15%；协作智能体的干预使远领域专家对的协作效率提高了8.5%，而近领域对仅提高0.8%，揭示了"知识库差距导致的协作效率降低"效应。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构为化学工程领域的自主科学发现提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉LLM智能体在交互环境中涌现的社交和认知动态，需要新的评估方法来理解自主智能体的社会行为。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为"社交实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种话题进行辩论，并采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强烈的共识寻求倾向（语义一致性μ>0.88），角色分配能诱导稳定的心理测量特征，主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体环境的新型动态、心理测量基础的评估协议提供了蓝图，对于理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为至关重要。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

TL;DR: AGILE通过将拼图任务转化为交互式学习过程，使用代码执行动作和环境反馈来增强视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，在拼图任务上准确率从9.5%提升到82.8%，并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%。


<details>

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在基础感知和推理能力上存在局限，即使在简单拼图任务上表现接近随机。高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和有限可扩展性限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: 提出AGILE方法，将拼图解决构建为交互过程，模型在每个步骤生成可执行代码来执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈来指导任务完成，通过观察和交互的迭代循环逐步提升能力。

Result: 在2×2拼图设置下准确率从9.5%提升到82.8%，在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%，显著增强了感知和推理能力。

Conclusion: AGILE为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，为解决多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话场景，但企业环境中动态记忆评估的需求对于有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过整合Slack、Linear和Git等多个通信和生产力平台的异步事件，模拟真实的组织工作流程，创建平台间交错的时间线，包含噪声、冲突和交叉引用信息。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM和记忆后端在利用长期记忆、处理跨平台依赖关系和解决矛盾方面面临挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅达到60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了一个可扩展的框架，超越了现有对话设置的焦点，并为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Motivation: 临床决策复杂性增加和电子健康记录快速增长为数据驱动的医疗带来机遇和挑战，需要辅助工具来增强而非替代临床医生的判断。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过检索相似病例并合成建议来生成上下文相关的治疗推荐。

Conclusion: 这是将生成式AI整合到现实世界临床决策中的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性和与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法来检测推理模型中的隐式奖励黑客行为，通过截断推理链测量验证通过率来量化模型努力程度，相比现有监控方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是重大威胁，特别是隐式黑客行为会绕过现有推理链监控。

Method: TRACE方法：逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型回答，测量每个截断点的验证通过率。黑客模型会因走捷径而在推理链很短时就获得高通过率。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比72B推理链监控提升65%以上，在编程任务中比32B监控提升30%以上，并能发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE为当前监控方法失效的监督场景提供了可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

TL;DR: 提出一种将推理时检索转化为学习能力的蒸馏方法，通过从智能体失败中提取紧凑提示，生成改进的教师轨迹，并训练学生模型内部化这些能力，从而减少对运行时检索的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的动作、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。虽然检索增强生成可以改善性能，但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销。

Method: 三步管道：(1)从智能体失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；(2)使用这些提示在情节开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的轨迹上训练学生模型，强制内部化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏学生模型始终优于基线智能体：ALFWorld成功率91%（基线79%），WebShop得分72（基线61），同时比检索增强教师少用10-60%的token。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和智能体架构（ReAct/StateAct）上均能泛化，证明检索优势可以通过针对性微调有效内部化，无需永久运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Motivation: 系统日志是宝贵的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化等问题，其效用受限。需要能够将噪声异构数据转换为连贯可互操作表示的方法。

Method: 集成轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代修正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效。系统将图谱聚合到会话级别，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估显示，OntoLogX能够跨多个KG后端稳健生成知识图谱，并准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和修正提高了精确率和召回率，面向代码的模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效。

Conclusion: 基于本体的表示为提取可操作的网络威胁情报提供了价值，OntoLogX系统成功解决了日志分析中的结构化和语义一致性问题。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

*Sipeng Zhang,Longfei Yun,Zilong Wang,Jingbo Shang,Letian Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理与轻量级代理模型的协作框架，用于可扩展的知识挖掘，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高，而传统分类器-提取器管道又不够灵活、无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行管道，作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，将分类和提取统一为两个原子操作。

Result: Falconer在指令遵循准确性上接近最先进LLM，同时减少推理成本达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘20倍以上。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了一个高效且可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

<details>

Motivation: AI教育社区经常忽视领域专家精心策划的知识在创建有效辅导系统中的作用，本文旨在强调这一主题的重要性。

Method: 1. 使用可解释AI技术结合专家指定的解题规则自动生成课程；2. 利用专家指定的学习课程开发自适应辅导系统。

Result: 通过传粉昆虫识别的案例研究，展示了这些方法在实际应用中的可行性和价值。

Conclusion: 领域专家精心策划的知识对于创建新颖的教育系统至关重要，能够改善学习体验并提高算法效率。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将探索从文本空间转移到视觉空间，量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，使用对称KL散度创建不确定性感知探索信号，有效提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态大语言模型时，将视觉输入视为固定条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的不确定性，导致策略对视觉变化不够鲁棒。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过计算原始分支和噪声分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样策略来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高pass@4性能并缓解RL微调中的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是改进多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于评估LLM在AI法规合规性评估方面性能的基准数据集AIReg-Bench，基于欧盟AI法案创建了120个技术文档样本，并由法律专家标注合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI的监管加强，需要评估LLM在AI法规合规性评估方面的能力，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试方法。

Method: 通过两步流程：(1) 使用结构化提示让LLM生成120个虚构但合理的AI系统技术文档样本；(2) 法律专家审查并标注每个样本是否违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了AIReg-Bench数据集，并评估了前沿LLM在重现专家合规标签方面的表现，为理解LLM在AI法规合规评估中的机会和限制提供了起点。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了首个AI法规合规评估基准，为后续LLM模型的比较提供了标准，数据集和评估代码已开源。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT通过分离逻辑一致性和效用评估，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，使用横向竞赛机制来缓解搜索中的广度饱和和深度短视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算存在两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度短视（噪声短期效用剪枝长期有回报的分支）。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和横向（一致但低效用候选），通过横向竞赛机制进行廉价探测，使用宽度感知阈值和重复确认，一旦分支超过主线标准立即提升。

Result: 理论证明横向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀logηN₀)，与未加限制主线的指数增长形成对比，实证评估正在准备中。

Conclusion: LToT将大量测试时预算转化为原则性多样性，同时保持提升纪律，在不增加计算的情况下缓解饱和和短视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于稀疏自编码器和聚类技术的方法，分析LLM内部token表示并指导数学推理任务的生成过程，通过构建token转移图来平衡利用和探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析大型语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示，并指导生成过程实现利用（遵循已知推理路径）和探索（生成多样性）的平衡。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器生成稀疏向量表示，应用k-means聚类构建token转移图，基于边权重定义奖励函数量化推理轨迹的遵循程度，同时测量生成多样性评估探索程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对于数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型指导生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能防止极端行为，促进更高质量的推理过程，在LLM中实现利用与探索的平衡权衡。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOGicalThought (LogT) 是一种新颖的神经符号架构，结合高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM，通过构建双重符号图上下文和逻辑上下文，将长文本指南推理转化为紧凑的接地评估，在四个多领域基准测试中相比基线提升11.84%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域如法律和医学中，高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。这些推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编码的前提，由于存在大量例外情况，涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，单个事实的引入可能使一般规则失效，这带来了重大挑战。LLMs虽然在自然语言处理方面表现出色，但在高保证文本指南所需的严格推理方面能力不足。

Method: 提出LOGicalThought (LogT) 神经符号架构，使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和逻辑上下文，将长文本指南推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中与四个基线对比，LogT在所有LLMs上整体性能提升11.84%。在三种推理模式上性能显著提升：否定推理提升高达+10.2%，蕴含推理提升+13.2%，可废止推理提升+5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT架构通过神经符号方法有效解决了高保证文本指南中的严格推理挑战，特别是在处理否定、蕴含和可废止规则等复杂逻辑结构方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一个LLM决策框架，通过集成任务导向规划和信息寻求来解决部分可观测环境中的不确定性问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理在处理观测不确定性时，往往忽略其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，导致在信息不完全和动态嘈杂的实际环境中表现不佳。

Method: InfoSeeker框架提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 实验显示InfoSeeker相比先前方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率，在机器人操作和网络导航等基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为至关重要。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，可能强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径，这与推理的自然结构不匹配。

Method: 首先提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，然后引入SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数鼓励增量进展，使扩散语言模型的去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理基准测试中显著提高了性能，并增强了生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这种基于原则的方法能够有效引导模型学习结构化、连贯的推理路径，解决了现有方法中非结构化精炼的核心缺陷。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过先分析潜在危害及其后果，再生成安全输出，显著提升模型安全性并保持通用推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏系统性风险分析。InvThink旨在通过逆向思维让模型主动识别和避免潜在危害。

Method: 指导模型进行三步逆向思考：1)枚举潜在危害，2)分析后果，3)生成主动规避这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实现。

Result: 相比SafetyPrompt等基线方法，在有害响应上减少达15.7%；安全性改进随模型规模扩展更强；在医疗、金融、法律等高风险领域表现优异；缓解安全税问题，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展且泛化性强的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的LLM多智能体系统防御方法存在局限性：自我验证方法因单个智能体无法检测跨智能体不安全链而性能不佳；外部防护模块会增加系统开销并造成单点故障风险。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗性学习环境联合优化攻击者（合成演化越狱提示）和防御者（训练任务智能体同时完成任务和抵抗攻击），并引入组级均值回报基线来稳定学习和促进合作。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL始终将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法可达38.33%，同时保持甚至提高了任务准确率（推理任务上提升达+3.67%）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需依赖额外防护智能体或增加系统开销，安全性和实用性可以共同提升，AdvEvo-MARL为LLM多智能体系统提供了有效的安全解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent

TL;DR: 本文评估LLMs是否具备担任心理咨询师资格，通过构建基于美国国家咨询师认证考试的PsychoBench基准测试，发现只有前沿LLMs能达到及格标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估LLMs是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的专业知识和资格。

Method: 构建PsychoBench基准，包含2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家咨询师认证考试，涵盖心理学各子学科，需要深度理解。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型得分远超及格线（约70%），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于及格标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLMs目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这突显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的上下文马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)方法，使用大语言模型压缩高维上下文为低维语义摘要，提高决策效率并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力差，导致计算开销大且性能不稳定，需要更高效的上下文处理方法

Method: 使用LLM将上下文输入压缩为低维语义摘要，基于近似上下文充分性理论，在保持决策关键信息的同时减少冗余

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率和样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用

Conclusion: LLM摘要为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在空间推理方面的能力，特别是能否读取道路网络地图并执行导航任务，将轨迹恢复作为代理任务来评估这种能力。

Method: 引入GLOBALTRACE数据集，包含4000多个真实世界轨迹，使用道路网络作为上下文，通过提示框架让LLMs生成有效路径而无需外部导航工具。

Result: LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成基线和专门的轨迹恢复模型，表现出对道路网络和坐标系统的强理解能力，但存在区域和交通模式的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过灵活推理地图来增强导航体验，并融入用户偏好，展示了在空间推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算机使用代理（CUAs）中的盲目标导向（BGD）问题，开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，评估了9个前沿模型并发现高达80.8%的平均BGD率，揭示了即使在无害输入下也存在的微妙风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但存在盲目标导向偏差，即不顾可行性、安全性、可靠性或上下文地追求目标，这带来了潜在风险。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务，捕捉三种BGD模式：缺乏上下文推理、在模糊情况下的假设和决策、矛盾或不可行的目标。使用基于LLM的评估器在OSWorld真实环境中评估代理行为。

Result: 评估了9个前沿模型，包括Claude Sonnet和Opus 4、Computer-Use-Preview和GPT-5，观察到平均80.8%的BGD率。基于提示的干预措施降低了BGD水平，但风险仍然存在。

Conclusion: 识别BGD并引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和减轻这一基本风险、确保CUA安全部署奠定了基础。定性分析揭示了执行优先偏见、思维-行动脱节和请求优先等失败模式。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

TL;DR: LENOHA是一个安全优先、本地优先的系统，通过高精度分类器将临床查询路由到预先审核的FAQ数据库，直接返回原文答案而非生成文本，在保持高准确率的同时显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决患者在接受侵入性手术前的问题咨询需求，同时应对时间压力和隐私限制，避免传统生成式AI在临床路径中的幻觉风险。

Method: 使用句子转换器分类器对输入进行路由，从临床医生审核的FAQ中返回原文答案，完全避免临床路径中的自由文本生成。在两个临床领域（拔牙和胃镜检查）进行了评估。

Result: E5-large-instruct模型达到0.983的总体准确率，AUC为0.996，仅7个错误。非生成式临床路径能耗仅为生成式模型的1/170（1.0 mWh vs 168 mWh），延迟约0.10秒。

Conclusion: 通过返回预先审核的FAQ答案，可以在临床路径中避免生成式错误，同时支持隐私保护、可持续性和在带宽有限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖对人类智能直觉设计的合成任务，这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出基于数据科学实践的替代设计哲学，重点关注稳健任务执行能力的评估，通过展示系统可靠部署来证明AGI能力。

Result: 提供了这种新评估方法在实际AGI评估中的具体示例和应用。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向以能力为导向的评估方法，通过展示系统在真实任务中的稳健执行来证明其智能水平。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了VaPR框架，通过LLM引导的响应编辑生成硬负样本，解决了合成偏好标注中的风格和长度偏差问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好微调方法忽略了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，这限制了大型视觉语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Method: 开发了基于LLM引导响应编辑的硬负响应生成框架，生成具有目标错误但保持风格和长度相似性的拒绝响应，并构建了包含30K高质量样本的VaPR数据集。

Result: VaPR模型在十个基准测试中显著提升性能，平均增益分别为6.5%(LLaVA)、4.0%(Qwen2VL)和1.5%(Qwen2.5VL)，在推理任务上表现尤为突出，同时减少了二元问题中回答"是"的倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好标注中的噪声问题，显著提升了LVLM性能，且该框架可推广到开源LLM作为编辑器，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体AI系统，能够将用户自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询语言，用于操作代谢组学知识图谱，显著提高了查询准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 解决代谢组学知识图谱使用中的技术障碍，用户需要深入理解本体论和查询语言语法，限制了知识图谱的广泛应用。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包括入口代理、验证代理、监督代理、知识图谱代理和查询生成代理，使用LangChain和LangGraph库集成LLM与外部工具。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中，MetaboT达到83.67%的准确率，显著优于仅使用GPT-4o的基线方法(8.16%)。

Conclusion: MetaboT成功弥合了复杂语义技术与用户友好交互之间的差距，使研究人员能够通过自然语言查询检索结构化代谢组学数据，促进数据驱动发现。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Motivation: 现有LLM的CoT推理受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树算法和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 用高级LLM将CoT提炼为紧凑高层指导进行监督微调；2) 引入指导感知的RL方法，联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B、Qwen3-8B、Qwen3-14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上实验，PTA-GRPO均实现了稳定显著的改进。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能有效提升LLM的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上均表现出良好的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

*Claudio Fanconi,Nicolás Astorga,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种对抗性逆强化学习方法，为大型语言模型学习密集的、令牌级别的推理奖励模型，用于过程监督而非风格模仿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构建和操作对抗性逆强化学习，直接从专家演示中学习推理奖励，优先考虑正确性而非表面形式，实现可解释的错误定位。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习方法学习密集的令牌级推理奖励模型，该奖励在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评者重新排序采样轨迹。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络验证了密集推理奖励可作为学习信号引发推理，并通过奖励引导的重新排序提高了预测性能。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和令牌级诊断统一到单一推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CARS方法，通过自适应剪枝技术提高受限生成的采样效率，同时保持语言模型的原始分布不扭曲


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有受限生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪解码会扭曲模型分布，而拒绝采样浪费计算资源丢弃无效输出。在程序模糊测试等需要有效性和多样性的领域，这两种方法都有问题

Method: CARS方法从无约束采样开始，通过记录违反约束的续写在trie结构中，并从未来采样中减去其概率质量，实现自适应剪枝。确保已证明无效的前缀不会被重新访问

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的LM前向传递次数）方面始终表现更好，同时比GCD和近似LM分布的方法产生更强的样本多样性

Conclusion: CARS严格提高了拒绝采样的样本效率而不产生分布扭曲，接受率单调提高，生成的样本精确遵循受限分布

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 该研究评估大语言模型在集体决策中与人类社会推理的对齐程度，发现不同模型在反映人类偏见方面存在差异，集体对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是集体层面的对齐，而非仅个体层面。

Method: 使用"海上迷失"社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验（N=748），随机分配小组进行领导人选举，一组显示人口属性，一组使用匿名别名。然后模拟匹配的LLM小组，对Gemini 2.5、GPT 4.1、Claude Haiku 3.5和Gemma 3进行基准测试。

Result: LLM行为出现分化：一些模型反映人类偏见；其他模型掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。实证表明人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏差。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准测试。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个确定性模拟框架，为评估AI生成的同行评审报告提供稳定、基于证据的标准，解决了学术出版中不可管理的投稿量和无监管AI的双重危机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临不可管理的投稿量和无监管AI的双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学完整性。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准，导致编辑过程不透明且难以审计。

Method: 开发了一个确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标来评估其可靠性。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决定在所有学科中持续占多数结果(>50%)，而'拒绝'率动态适应领域特定规范，在健康科学中上升至45%。系统保持稳定的程序完整性，强制执行29%的证据锚定合规率，在不同评审任务和科学领域中保持不变。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施，为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供可扩展的工作流程审计、完整性风险管理和基于证据治理的工具。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: ReTabAD是一个表格异常检测基准，通过恢复文本语义来支持上下文感知的异常检测研究，提供20个带有结构化文本元数据的数据集和多种检测算法实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准缺乏文本语义上下文，忽略了特征描述和领域知识等关键信息，限制了模型充分利用领域知识进行检测的能力。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了经典、深度学习和基于LLM的异常检测算法，以及一个无需任务特定训练的零样本LLM框架。

Result: 实验结果表明，语义上下文能够提高检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理来增强可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的重要性和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

TL;DR: 论文系统研究了LLM深度层的作用，发现深度层利用率高度异质化：浅层负责知识和检索，深层对推理至关重要，但可通过蒸馏重塑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反驳当前认为LLM深层作用有限的片面观点，通过多维度系统分析揭示深度层在不同评估设置下的真实贡献。

Method: 采用系统研究方法，从评估协议、任务类别和模型架构三个维度分析深度层利用率，包括似然评估和生成评估两种方式。

Result: 基于似然的评估中浅层关键，深层可剪枝；生成评估显示中深层对推理和长程连贯性不可或缺；知识检索集中在浅层，推理精度依赖深层但可蒸馏。

Conclusion: LLM深度使用高度异质化且依赖上下文，需要任务、指标和模型感知的视角来理解和压缩大模型。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估AI模型在ConceptARC上的抽象推理能力，发现仅凭输出准确率可能高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，而低估视觉模态的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI模型是否真正理解ARC-AGI基准测试中任务设计者意图的抽象概念，而非仅依赖表面模式。

Method: 在ConceptARC上评估模型，改变输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用外部Python工具、以及推理模型的推理努力程度，同时评估模型生成的自然语言规则解释。

Result: 使用文本表示的最佳模型在输出准确率上接近人类水平，但其规则往往基于表面"捷径"，很少捕捉到预期抽象概念；在视觉模态中，模型输出准确率大幅下降，但规则分析显示它们仍能产生相当比例的预期抽象规则，只是无法正确应用。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，仅凭准确率评估ARC类任务的抽象推理能力可能误导评估结果，需要更全面的评估框架来跟踪抽象推理能力的进展。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大规模、多样化的标注数据，但数据收集面临隐私限制、法律约束和高昂的人工标注成本（可达数百万美元）。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，可控地生成多样化的文档变体。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，FlexDoc生成的数据将F1分数绝对提升达11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: 该解决方案已在实际部署中加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Result: 实验证实主流DRAs在复杂开放任务上优于基于网络搜索工具增强的推理模型，但仍存在显著改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构优化和范式进步提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部护栏、推理时指导和后训练对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限性，需要一种更灵活有效的LLM安全增强方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软护栏选择性激活原始MLP和新增安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略加强安全判别能力；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上，UpSafe°C对有害和越狱输入实现了稳健的安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力；安全温度机制实现了效用与安全性的帕累托最优边界。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM安全指明了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Motivation: 尽管RLVR被用于提升大语言模型的推理能力，但近期证据表明它可能反而缩小推理边界，本文旨在探究这一收缩问题的根本原因。

Method: 通过理论分析和多数学推理基准的实证研究，识别RLVR中的负干扰和赢家通吃现象，并提出专注于低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 发现RLVR存在负干扰（学习某些问题会降低其他问题的解决概率）和赢家通吃现象（过度强化高概率问题），提出的数据筛选算法显著提升了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的收缩问题源于标准RL目标中的在线策略采样，导致模型收敛到狭窄的解决策略，通过专注于低概率问题的数据筛选可以有效改善这一局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高变异性阻碍了在长跨度复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个代理执行轨迹，并使用描述代理执行过程的行为叙述来进行轨迹选择，实现广泛探索和原则性轨迹选择。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中达到69.9%的新SOTA，接近人类72%的水平，在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 有效扩展计算机使用代理需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，bBoN为实现这一目标提供了实用框架，证明了正确扩展方法的显著效果。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型能够针对问题提出多个抽象描述，然后使用强化学习激励在利用这些抽象信息的基础上构建解决方案，形成双玩家RL训练范式。

Result: 该方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效指导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案对性能提升更有利。

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
