### [1] [Generating Query-Relevant Document Summaries via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08404)
*Nitin Yadav,Changsung Kang,Hongwei Shang,Ming Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出ReLSum框架，通过强化学习生成简洁且与查询相关的产品描述摘要，以优化电商搜索相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商搜索引擎仅依赖产品标题进行排序，导致相关性预测不理想，而产品描述虽信息丰富但冗长，不适合实时排序。

Method: 提出ReLSum框架，利用强化学习生成摘要，结合相关性分数作为奖励，并采用可训练的大型语言模型（LLM）生成摘要。

Result: 实验结果显示，ReLSum在离线指标（如召回率和NDCG）和在线用户参与度指标上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLSum为大规模电商系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的搜索相关性增强解决方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

### [2] [Temporal User Profiling with LLMs: Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Preferences for Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08454)
*Milad Sabouri,Masoud Mansoury,Kun Lin,Bamshad Mobasher*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LLM-TUP是一种基于大语言模型的用户画像方法，通过时间戳和自然语言表示动态建模长短期偏好，显著提升推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像方法过于简单，无法捕捉长短期偏好的动态交互，限制了推荐系统的表现。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成用户历史的自然语言表示，结合BERT编码和注意力机制动态融合长短期偏好。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LLM-TUP显著优于基线方法，验证了时间感知和语义丰富用户画像的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM-TUP通过动态建模长短期偏好，生成语义丰富的用户画像，显著提升了内容推荐的个性化效果。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

### [3] [Using LLMs to Capture Users' Temporal Context for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08512)
*Milad Sabouri,Masoud Mansoury,Kun Lin,Bamshad Mobasher*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用大语言模型（LLM）生成具有时间感知的用户画像，以动态捕捉用户短期和长期偏好，从而提升推荐系统的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用户画像方法难以捕捉用户偏好的时间动态性（如短期兴趣与长期偏好），因此研究LLM在生成语义丰富、时间感知的用户画像中的有效性。

Method: 通过解耦短期和长期偏好，将时间动态性作为用户上下文，并自适应融合这些上下文组件到用户嵌入中。

Result: 在Movies&TV等密集领域效果显著，但在Video Games等稀疏领域改进有限，效果依赖于用户交互历史的丰富程度。

Conclusion: LLM在增强用户画像方面具有潜力，但实际应用效果受数据集特性影响显著。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

### [4] [Adaptive Personalized Conversational Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08634)
*Fengran Mo,Yuchen Hui,Yuxing Tian,Zhaoxuan Tan,Chuan Meng,Zhan Su,Kaiyu Huang,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应个性化对话信息检索方法APCIR，通过动态调整个性化级别和查询重构，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话信息检索系统通常采用‘一刀切’的个性化策略，可能导致效果不佳。研究旨在解决如何根据查询需求动态调整个性化。

Method: 提出APCIR框架，先识别查询所需的个性化级别，再结合查询重构生成增强查询，并设计动态权重融合方法。

Result: 在TREC iKAT数据集上测试，APCIR表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化策略能有效提升对话信息检索性能。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

*Pierre Maillot,Catherine Faron,Fabien Gandon,Franck Michel,Pierre Monnin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: IndeGx框架通过扩展规则和SPARQL端点索引知识图谱内容，结合知识表示与推理方法，构建了一个可扩展的公共知识图谱索引系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着知识图谱的快速增长和多样化，需要一个系统化的方法来索引和评估其内容及特征，以帮助理解语义网中的知识分布和实际应用情况。

Method: 扩展IndeGx框架，采用基于SPARQL规则和OWL RL本体的声明式表示方法，结合协作环境（如GitHub），构建和维护知识图谱索引。

Result: 成功应用于300多个开放知识图谱端点，提供了关于标准语言支持、本体使用和质量评估的语义网现状快照。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅帮助用户了解语义网中的知识分布，还为社区监控知识表示研究成果的实际应用提供了工具。

Abstract: Over the last decade, knowledge graphs have multiplied, grown, and evolved on
the World Wide Web, and the advent of new standards, vocabularies, and
application domains has accelerated this trend. IndeGx is a framework
leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the
capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge
representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a
reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with
respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a
fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL
rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and
reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection
of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a
declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative
environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive
KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in
the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is
out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our
community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In
particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web
regarding supported standard languages, ontology usage, and diverse quality
evaluations by applying this method to a collection of over 300 open knowledge
graph endpoints.

### [6] [Comprehensive Comparison Network: a framework for locality-aware, routes-comparable and interpretable route recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08745)
*Chao Chen,Longfei Xu,Hanyu Guo,Chengzhang Wang,Ying Wang,Kaikui Liu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CCN的新型模型，通过引入比较级特征和综合比较块，显著提升了路线推荐性能，并具备强解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法忽视了路线局部质量和候选路线间的比较，而这对提升推荐性能至关重要。

Method: CCN结合查询级、项目级和比较级特征，通过综合比较块（CCB）和多场景MLP实现路线间的比较和评分。

Result: 离线与在线实验表明，CCN显著提升了推荐性能，并具备强解释性，已在Amap应用中稳定部署一年。

Conclusion: CCN通过综合比较和解释性设计，为路线推荐提供了稳定且最优的解决方案。

Abstract: Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,
with the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to
users. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local
quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for
enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.
To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison
Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and
item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in
traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features
which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture
the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block
(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a
Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can
update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive
comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of
candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since
routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model
must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an
interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline
and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR
performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed
in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for
route recommendations.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为离线评估工具的新框架，用于评估播客推荐系统的质量，解决了传统方法的偏差和高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线评估指标存在曝光偏差，而在线A/B测试成本高且操作受限，尤其是在长音频领域（如播客）中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先从90天的收听历史中构建自然语言用户画像，然后利用LLM基于这些画像进行细粒度的点对点和成对判断。

Result: 在47名参与者的对照研究中，基于画像的评估与人类判断高度一致，且优于或等同于使用原始收听历史的变体。

Conclusion: 该框架为推荐系统提供了一种高效、可解释的评估方法，支持迭代测试和模型选择。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

### [9] [Mitigating Popularity Bias in Counterfactual Explanations using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08946)
*Arjan Hasami,Masoud Mansoury*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型预处理历史数据的方法，以减少反事实解释中的偏见，使其更符合用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法易受偏见影响，可能生成与用户实际偏好不符的解释。

Method: 提出预处理步骤，利用大语言模型过滤不符合用户特征的历史数据，再生成解释。

Result: 在实验中，该方法生成的解释比单独使用ACCENT框架更符合用户的流行度偏好。

Conclusion: 通过预处理步骤，反事实解释能更准确地反映用户偏好，减少偏见。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) offer a tangible and actionable way to
explain recommendations by showing users a "what-if" scenario that demonstrates
how small changes in their history would alter the system's output. However,
existing CFE methods are susceptible to bias, generating explanations that
might misalign with the user's actual preferences. In this paper, we propose a
pre-processing step that leverages large language models to filter
out-of-character history items before generating an explanation. In experiments
on two public datasets, we focus on popularity bias and apply our approach to
ACCENT, a neural CFE framework. We find that it creates counterfactuals that
are more closely aligned with each user's popularity preferences than ACCENT
alone.

*Jialiang Shi,Yaguang Dou,Tian Qi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SPARC的新型检索框架，通过动态离散兴趣空间和概率兴趣模块，解决了推荐系统中多兴趣建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多兴趣检索方法存在兴趣静态化、缺乏动态演化和主动探索的问题，限制了推荐系统的效果。

Method: 利用RQ-VAE构建离散兴趣空间，结合概率兴趣模块实现动态兴趣建模和软搜索策略。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示用户观看时长和页面浏览量显著提升，离线实验在召回率和NDCG指标上也有改进。

Conclusion: SPARC框架有效解决了多兴趣建模问题，提升了推荐系统的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.

Motivation: 社交媒体中多媒体内容的泛滥导致虚假信息迅速传播，尤其是在危机事件中，亟需强大的验证工具。

Result: 系统在Grand Challenge基准测试中表现优异，适用于多样化的现实场景。

Conclusion: 该系统推动了多媒体验证技术的发展，为记者、事实核查者和研究人员提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content on social media platforms has
dramatically transformed how information is consumed and disseminated. While
this shift enables real-time coverage of global events, it also facilitates the
rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation, especially during crises
such as wars, natural disasters, or elections. The rise of synthetic media and
the reuse of authentic content in misleading contexts have intensified the need
for robust multimedia verification tools. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive system developed for the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on
Multimedia Verification. Our system assesses the authenticity and contextual
accuracy of multimedia content in multilingual settings and generates both
expert-oriented verification reports and accessible summaries for the general
public. We introduce a unified verification pipeline that integrates visual
forensics, textual analysis, and multimodal reasoning, and propose a hybrid
approach to detect out-of-context (OOC) media through semantic similarity,
temporal alignment, and geolocation cues. Extensive evaluations on the Grand
Challenge benchmark demonstrate the system's effectiveness across diverse
real-world scenarios. Our contributions advance the state of the art in
multimedia verification and offer practical tools for journalists,
fact-checkers, and researchers confronting information integrity challenges in
the digital age.

### [12] [DASC: Depth-of-Field Aware Scene Complexity Metric for 3D Visualization on Light Field Display](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08928)
*Kamran Akbar,Robert Bregovic,Federica Battisti*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度感知场景复杂度（DASC）指标，用于评估3D内容在光场显示中的表现，并通过主观研究预测用户偏好的模糊程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光场显示在窄深度范围外会出现伪影，现有解决方案可能导致细节丢失，因此需要一种新方法来优化模糊程度。

Method: 提出DASC指标，结合几何和位置因素评估场景复杂度，并通过主观研究分析用户对不同模糊程度的偏好。

Result: 基于主观研究结果，提出了一个模型，根据DASC指标预测用户偏好的模糊程度。

Conclusion: DASC指标和预测模型有助于优化光场显示中3D内容的模糊处理，提升用户体验。

Abstract: Light field display is one of the technologies providing 3D immersive
visualization. However, a light field display generates only a limited number
of light rays which results in finite angular and spatial resolutions.
Therefore, 3D content can be shown with high quality only within a narrow depth
range notated as Depth of Field (DoF) around the display screen. Outside this
range, due to the appearance of aliasing artifacts, the quality degrades
proportionally to the distance from the screen. One solution to mitigate the
artifacts is depth of field rendering which blurs the content in the distorted
regions, but can result in the removal of scene details. This research focuses
on proposing a DoF Aware Scene Complexity (DASC) metric that characterizes 3D
content based on geometrical and positional factors considering the light field
display's DoF. In this research, we also evaluate the observers' preference
across different level of blurriness caused by DoF rendering ranging from
sharp, aliased scenes to overly smoothed alias-free scenes. We have conducted
this study over multiple scenes that we created to account for different types
of content. Based on the outcome of subjective studies, we propose a model that
takes the value of DASC metric as input and predicts the preferred level of
blurring for the given scene as output.

*Stephen Arndt,Benjamin Moseley,Kirk Pruhs,Marc Uetz*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更简单的算法设计和分析，用于在线运输问题，目标是减少车辆行驶的总距离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在线运输问题中车辆分配的最优竞争比问题，简化现有算法的复杂性。

Method: 提出一种替代的确定性算法设计，并进行分析。

Result: 算法具有O(m)的竞争比，与现有研究一致。

Conclusion: 新算法设计更简单，为在线运输问题提供了更清晰的解决方案。

Abstract: The setting for the online transportation problem is a metric space $M$,
populated by $m$ parking garages of varying capacities. Over time cars arrive
in $M$, and must be irrevocably assigned to a parking garage upon arrival in a
way that respects the garage capacities. The objective is to minimize the
aggregate distance traveled by the cars. In 1998, Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs
conjectured that there is a $(2m-1)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for
the online transportation problem, matching the optimal competitive ratio for
the simpler online metric matching problem. Recently, Harada and Itoh presented
the first $O(m)$-competitive deterministic algorithm for the online
transportation problem. Our contribution is an alternative algorithm design and
analysis that we believe is simpler.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 设计了一个确定性编译器，使Congested Clique模型中的计算对常数比例α<1的对抗性崩溃故障具有鲁棒性，并展示了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在存在节点崩溃的对抗性环境中，如何高效执行计算的问题。

Method: 利用局部可解码码（LDCs）在网络中编码信息，并通过确定性选择查询集避免崩溃节点，同时采用自适应加倍策略应对解码失败。

Result: 实现了在故障模型中的高效计算，时间复杂度为d⋅⌈ω/n²+Δ/n⌉⋅2^O(√(logn)loglogn)轮。

Conclusion: 通过LDCs和自适应策略，成功在对抗性崩溃环境中实现了高效且鲁棒的计算。

Abstract: We design a deterministic compiler that makes any computation in the
Congested Clique model robust to a constant fraction $\alpha<1$ of adversarial
crash faults. In particular, we show how a network of $n$ nodes can compute any
circuit of depth $d$, width $\omega$, and gate total fan $\Delta$, in
$d\cdot\lceil\frac{\omega}{n^2}+\frac{\Delta}{n}\rceil\cdot
2^{O(\sqrt{\log{n}}\log\log{n})}$ rounds in such a faulty model. As a
corollary, any $T$-round Congested Clique algorithm can be compiled into an
algorithm that completes in $T^2 n^{o(1)}$ rounds in this model.
  Our compiler obtains resilience to node crashes by coding information across
the network, where we leverage locally-decodable codes (LDCs) to maintain a low
complexity overhead, as these allow recovering the information needed at each
computational step by querying only small parts of the codeword.
  The main technical contribution is that because erasures occur in known
locations, which correspond to crashed nodes, we can derandomize classical LDC
constructions by deterministically selecting query sets that avoid sufficiently
many erasures. Moreover, when decoding multiple codewords in parallel, our
derandomization load-balances the queries per-node, thereby preventing
congestion and maintaining a low round complexity.
  Deterministic decoding of LDCs presents a new challenge: the adversary can
target precisely the (few) nodes that are queried for decoding a certain
codeword. We overcome this issue via an adaptive doubling strategy: if a
decoding attempt for a codeword fails, the node doubles the number of its
decoding attempts. Similarly, when the adversary crashes the decoding node
itself, we replace it dynamically with two other non-crashed nodes. By
carefully combining these two doubling processes, we overcome the challenges
posed by the combination of a deterministic LDC with a worst case pattern of
crashes.

Conclusion: 该研究为在线调度问题提供了高效解决方案，扩展了有界迁移调度算法的适用范围。

Abstract: We consider the problem of scheduling $n$ jobs on $m$ uniform machines while
minimizing the makespan ($Q||C_{\max}$) and maximizing the minimum completion
time ($Q||C_{\min}$) in an online setting with migration of jobs. In this
online setting, the jobs are inserted or deleted over time, and at each step,
the goal is to compute a near-optimal solution while reassigning some jobs,
such that the overall processing time of reassigned jobs, called migration, is
bounded by some factor $\beta$ times the processing time of the job added or
removed.
  We propose Efficient Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (EPTASs) with an
additional load error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon p_{\max})$ for both problems,
with constant amortized migration factor $\beta$, where $p_{\max}$ is the
maximum processing time in the instance over all steps. As an intermediate
step, we obtain Efficient Parameterized Approximation Schemes (EPASs) for both
problems, $(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithms parameterized by $p_{\max}$
and the number of different processing times $d$ in an instance, with $\beta$
bounded in a function of $p_{\max}$, $d$ and $\varepsilon$.
  This is the first result in the direction of a polynomial time approximation
scheme in the field of online scheduling with bounded reassignment on uniform
machines; before, such results were known only for the considered problems on
identical machines. Crucial to our result is a division of the machines into
large and small machines depending on the current approximate objective value,
allowing for different approaches on either machine set, as well as a new way
of rounding the instance that does not depend on the current objective value.

TL;DR: Fier提出了一种细粒度高效的KV缓存检索方法，通过1-bit量化键估计令牌重要性，显著减少解码延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存读取延迟随上下文长度增加而显著上升，现有方法因令牌稀疏分布导致检索不准确。

Method: 使用1-bit量化键估计令牌重要性，实现高效精确的KV缓存检索。

Result: 实验表明，Fier仅需11%缓存预算即可匹配全KV性能，解码延迟降低1.2至1.5倍。

Conclusion: Fier在长上下文任务中表现出高效性和精确性，显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache reading latency increases significantly with context
lengths, hindering the efficiency of long-context LLM inference. To address
this, previous works propose retaining a small fraction of KV cache based on
token importance. For example, KV eviction uses static heuristics to retain
tokens, while KV retrieval dynamically selects query-relevant tokens for more
adaptive cache management. However, we observe that important tokens are often
sparsely distributed across the long context. This sparsity makes existing
page-level KV retrieval inaccurate, as each page may include irrelevant tokens
and miss critical ones. In this work, we propose Fier, a
\underline{Fi}ne-Grained and \underline{E}fficient KV cache
\underline{R}etrieval method. Fier uses 1-bit quantized keys to estimate the
importance of each token, resulting in efficient and precise retrieval.
Experiments show that Fier matches full KV performance using only 11\% of the
cache budget across various long-context tasks, reducing decoding latency by
1.2$\times$ to 1.5$\times$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库（RDBs）的结构限制了其利用深度学习方法的能力，现有研究主要关注一元依赖关系，而忽略了复合依赖关系。

Method: SRP通过合成一元依赖特征、检索相关信息和在图结构中传播消息，捕捉一元和复合依赖关系。

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验证明了SRP的有效性和工业应用潜力。

Conclusion: SRP通过新检索机制提升了RDB的预测能力，为未来应用提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) have become the industry standard for storing
massive and heterogeneous data. However, despite the widespread use of RDBs
across various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders
their ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous
research has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among
multiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key
relationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or
constructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations
among different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for
predictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified
predictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary
dependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,
and propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns
for prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism
into RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite
dependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive
field of tabular data prediction. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis on the components of SRP, offering a nuanced understanding of model
behaviors and practical guidelines for future applications. Extensive
experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRP
and its potential applicability in industrial scenarios. The code is released
at https://github.com/NingLi670/SRP.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过跨栈方法提升机器学习系统效率，涵盖算法、系统和硬件层面的优化，特别针对RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统日益复杂且硬件环境快速变化，传统方法难以满足效率需求，需跨栈优化。

Method: 提出多种优化方案：PipeRAG（算法）、RAGO（系统）、Chameleon（硬件）优化RAG；FANNS和Falcon优化向量搜索；MicroRec和FleetRec优化推荐系统。

Result: 通过跨栈优化显著提升了RAG、向量搜索和推荐系统的效率。

Conclusion: 跨栈方法是提升复杂ML系统效率的有效途径，需结合算法、系统和硬件协同设计。

Abstract: Today, two major trends are shaping the evolution of ML systems. First,
modern AI systems are becoming increasingly complex, often integrating
components beyond the model itself. A notable example is Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), which incorporates not only multiple models but also vector
databases, leading to heterogeneity in both system components and underlying
hardware. Second, with the end of Moore's Law, achieving high system efficiency
is no longer feasible without accounting for the rapid evolution of the
hardware landscape.
  Building on the observations above, this thesis adopts a cross-stack approach
to improving ML system efficiency, presenting solutions that span algorithms,
systems, and hardware. First, it introduces several pioneering works about RAG
serving efficiency across the computing stack. PipeRAG focuses on
algorithm-level improvements, RAGO introduces system-level optimizations, and
Chameleon explores heterogeneous accelerator systems for RAG. Second, this
thesis investigates algorithm-hardware co-design for vector search.
Specifically, FANNS and Falcon optimize quantization-based and graph-based
vector search, the two most popular paradigms of retrieval algorithms. Third,
this thesis addresses the serving efficiency of recommender systems, another
example of vector-centric ML systems, where the memory-intensive lookup
operations on embedding vector tables often represent a major performance
bottleneck. MicroRec and FleetRec propose solutions at the hardware and system
levels, respectively, optimizing both data movement and computation to enhance
the efficiency of large-scale recommender models.

Motivation: 高维向量空间中的ANNS应用广泛，但现有图索引方法开销大，难以应对数据量增长和动态调整需求。

Method: 提出GNN-Descent算法加速k-NN图初始化，设计CFS框架支持多种剪枝策略，并开发异步GPU-CPU-磁盘索引框架处理大规模数据。

Result: 在7个真实数据集上，Tagore实现了1.32x-112.79x的加速，同时保持索引质量。

Conclusion: Tagore显著提升了图索引的效率和可扩展性，适用于大规模动态数据场景。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces
has a wide range of real-world applications. Numerous methods have been
proposed to handle ANNS efficiently, while graph-based indexes have gained
prominence due to their high accuracy and efficiency. However, the indexing
overhead of graph-based indexes remains substantial. With exponential growth in
data volume and increasing demands for dynamic index adjustments, this overhead
continues to escalate, posing a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce
Tagore, a fast library accelerated by GPUs for graph indexing, which has
powerful capabilities of constructing refinement-based graph indexes such as
NSG and Vamana. We first introduce GNN-Descent, a GPU-specific algorithm for
efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph initialization. GNN-Descent speeds up
the similarity comparison by a two-phase descent procedure and enables highly
parallelized neighbor updates. Next, aiming to support various k-NN graph
pruning strategies, we formulate a universal computing procedure termed CFS and
devise two generalized GPU kernels for parallel processing complex dependencies
in neighbor relationships. For large-scale datasets exceeding GPU memory
capacity, we propose an asynchronous GPU-CPU-disk indexing framework with a
cluster-aware caching mechanism to minimize the I/O pressure on the disk.
Extensive experiments on 7 real-world datasets exhibit that Tagore achieves
1.32x-112.79x speedup while maintaining the index quality.

Conclusion: 语义单元框架为生态数据整合、知识合成和因果推理提供了通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Ecological research increasingly relies on integrating heterogeneous datasets
and knowledge to explain and predict complex phenomena. Yet, differences in
data types, terminology, and documentation often hinder interoperability,
reuse, and causal understanding. We present the Semantic Units Framework, a
novel, domain-agnostic semantic modelling approach applied here to ecological
data and knowledge in compliance with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) and CLEAR (Cognitively interoperable, semantically
Linked, contextually Explorable, easily Accessible, human-Readable and
-interpretable) Principles. The framework models data and knowledge as modular,
logic-aware semantic units: single propositions (statement units) or coherent
groups of propositions (compound units). Statement units can model
measurements, observations, or universal relationships, including causal ones,
and link to methods and evidence. Compound units group related statement units
into reusable, semantically coherent knowledge objects. Implemented using RDF,
OWL, and knowledge graphs, semantic units can be serialized as FAIR Digital
Objects with persistent identifiers, provenance, and semantic interoperability.
We show how universal statement units build ecological causal networks, which
can be composed into causal maps and perspective-specific subnetworks. These
support causal reasoning, confounder detection (back-door), effect
identification with unobserved confounders (front-door), application of
do-calculus, and alignment with Bayesian networks, structural equation models,
and structural causal models. By linking fine-grained empirical data to
high-level causal reasoning, the Semantic Units Framework provides a foundation
for ecological knowledge synthesis, evidence annotation, cross-domain
integration, reproducible workflows, and AI-ready ecological research.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: E3-Rewrite是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的SQL查询重写框架，通过上下文构建和强化学习生成高效、等效且可执行的查询重写，显著提升了查询执行效率和覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的SQL查询重写方法泛化能力差且难以处理复杂查询，而直接应用LLM又容易生成次优或不等效的重写。E3-Rewrite旨在解决这些问题。

Method: E3-Rewrite结合了上下文构建模块（利用执行计划和示例生成提示）和强化学习框架（通过分阶段课程学习优化可执行性、等效性和效率）。

Result: 实验表明，E3-Rewrite在多个SQL基准测试中实现了高达25.6%的查询执行时间减少，并提升了24.4%的成功重写率。

Conclusion: E3-Rewrite通过LLM和强化学习的结合，显著提升了SQL查询重写的性能和适用范围。

Abstract: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form
while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite
rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1)
fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with
complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be
fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using
large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex
strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this
potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent
rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To
address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting
framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It
integrates two core components: a context construction module and a
reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution
plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide
inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting
executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks,
equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable
multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes
executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency.
Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in
query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL
benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites,
expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弗吉尼亚土地专利的描述形式限制了空间分析，因此需要一种高效、准确的方法将其转换为地理坐标。

Method: 使用六种OpenAI模型，在两种范式下（直接转换和工具增强链式思考）测试5,471份专利描述，并与GIS分析师等基线方法对比。

Result: 最佳模型（o3-2025-04-16）平均误差23公里，优于其他模型和基线方法；五模型集成进一步降低误差至19公里。

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理参考任务中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Result: Hat-DFed在复杂边缘环境中最大化模型性能的同时最小化累积能耗，并缓解了数据异构性导致的性能下降。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为边缘计算系统中的DFL提供了一种高效解决方案，平衡了模型性能和能源效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

Conclusion: XFMNet有效提升了时空分布时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Motivation: 深度学习的性能在训练和测试数据分布不同（域偏移）时会下降，而半监督域适应（SSDA）是解决此问题的主要方法。时间序列数据对噪声敏感，且序列依赖性会导致域偏移，从而严重影响性能。

Method: MoSSDA采用两步动量编码器框架，首先通过域不变编码器学习源域和目标域的特征，然后通过混合增强正对比模块（包含在线动量编码器）进一步优化特征。最后，分类器利用有限的目标域标签数据进行训练。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的实验表明，MoSSDA在三种不同骨干网络和各种未标记比例下均取得了最先进的性能。消融研究证实了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两步学习和对比模块，成功实现了对域偏移的鲁棒性和分类性能的提升，适用于多变量时间序列分类任务。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Conclusion: MGSTC能有效提升连续预测场景下的精度，适应实时需求。

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Conclusion: 结论是现代AI的成功可能源于生物学优化的计算原理，而不仅仅是架构创新。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

### [29] [Probabilistic Emissivity Retrieval from Hyperspectral Data via Physics-Guided Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08291)
*Joshua R. Tempelman,Kevin Mitchell,Adam J. Wachtor,Eric B. Flynn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于物理条件生成模型的逆建模方法，用于高光谱成像（HSI）目标识别，通过概率潜在变量模型学习HSI辐射测量分布，并生成发射率光谱的条件分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在HSI目标识别中存在局限性，如单类别预测、依赖训练库材料，且缺乏解释性。本文旨在通过物理条件生成模型解决这些问题。

Method: 采用概率潜在变量模型，结合HSI场景的大气和背景估计作为物理条件，使用循环增强方案和基于物理的损失标准，避免对预定义训练集的偏差。

Result: 模型通过蒙特卡洛采样生成发射率分布，提供可解释的不确定性量化，并提出基于分布的材料匹配方案。

Conclusion: 该方法能够结合HSI场景的上下文信息，捕捉材料光谱的潜在变化，并提供候选材料的概率解释。

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Result: DAMP在分布内和分布外泛化上均显著优于DARC。

Conclusion: MLP通道混合能提升循环卷积网络的泛化能力，DAMP适合作为超网络的目标架构。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

Motivation: 传统生成式竞价仅依赖回报作为最优性条件，缺乏个性化结构信息，且扩散模型的逐步生成机制存在时效性风险。

Method: 结合专家轨迹引导和跳步采样策略的条件扩散建模方法。

Result: 离线实验和在线A/B测试显示，该方法显著提升了转化率（11.29%）和收入（12.35%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动竞价中表现出优越的规划能力和生成效率，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在深层网络中易出现过平滑问题，现有方法无法有效处理深层特征，因此探索了Mamba作为替代投影器的潜力。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含分层自适应投影器（HAP）和源感知融合（SAF）模块，分别处理不同层级的特征并动态融合。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过全局-局部权衡的解决，显著提升了分子表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL是一种结合分割学习（SL）和分层联邦学习（HierFL）的新方法，通过中间层表示学习减少通信开销和协调复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架忽视边缘设备的计算异构性和资源限制，且通信成本高、模型聚合复杂。

Method: 提出SHeRL-FL，整合SL和分层模型聚合，引入中间层表示学习，使客户端和边缘服务器独立计算训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，SHeRL-FL在图像分类和分割任务中，数据传输减少90%以上，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL显著降低了通信和协调成本，提升了联邦学习的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [36] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊模式的Tsetlin机（FPTM），通过模糊评估子句而非严格评估，显著减少了所需子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Tsetlin机（TM）采用严格的“全有或全无”子句评估策略，需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确性。FPTM旨在通过模糊评估机制解决这一问题。

Method: FPTM引入模糊子句评估机制，即使部分字面量失败，剩余部分仍能按比例贡献投票，从而实现更灵活、高效和鲁棒的模式匹配。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM显著减少了子句数量和内存占用（如IMDb数据集减少50倍），训练速度提升316倍，同时准确性提高（如Fashion-MNIST达到94.68%）。

Conclusion: FPTM通过模糊评估机制，显著提升了Tsetlin机的效率和性能，适用于在线学习和资源受限环境。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDPA的数学形式通常由启发式驱动，缺乏理论依据。本文旨在为其提供第一性原理的证明。

Method: 通过将SDPA前向传播建模为EOT问题，并分析其后向传播梯度与强化学习中优势策略梯度的一致性。

Result: 证明了SDPA前向传播是EOT问题的解，后向传播梯度与优势策略梯度数学等价，且信息几何决定了学习梯度的形式。

Conclusion: SDPA是一种基于优化问题的机制，前向传播执行最优推断，后向传播实现合理的流形感知学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用（如推荐系统、在线广告）拥有大量离线数据，如何有效利用这些数据减少在线遗憾成为研究重点。

Method: OOPE算法通过扩展D-optimal设计在探索阶段利用离线数据，并采用Frank-Wolfe近似进一步优化设计。

Result: OOPE的在线遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$，且离线数据质量越高，遗憾越小。

Conclusion: OOPE在离线数据质量不同情况下均表现最优，并通过理论下界验证了其最优性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF提供了一种理论可靠且实用的解决方案，适用于复杂因果关系的建模。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于二次正则化的部分最优传输（QPOT）方法，解决了传统熵正则化方法导致传输计划稠密的问题，适用于需要稀疏性的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）假设输入测度质量相等，而部分最优传输（POT）放宽了这一限制，但现有POT求解器依赖熵正则化，导致传输计划稠密，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种基于二次正则化的POT新方法（QPOT），通过二次正则化诱导稀疏传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据集、CIFAR-10数据集以及颜色迁移和领域适应等实际应用中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为POT提供了一种稀疏性更强的替代方案，适用于多种需要稀疏传输计划的应用场景。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对异构计算资源的本地随机梯度下降（local SGD）方法，通过按计算能力分配工作负载并引入有偏数据采样和模型聚合，显著加速训练，且精度不亚于同步SGD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构计算资源（如GPU和CPU混合）在神经网络训练中未被充分利用，传统同步SGD因同步开销难以高效利用这些资源。

Method: 提出系统感知的本地SGD方法，按资源计算能力分配工作负载，并通过有偏数据采样和模型聚合优化慢速资源（如CPU）的利用率。

Result: 在异构环境中，该方法显著加速训练，且精度与同步SGD相当或更高。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至多种异构环境（如云平台、高性能计算集群），为异构资源的高效利用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: SHEFL通过动态资源分配和偏差感知聚合，有效解决了联邦学习中的计算异构性问题。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Conclusion: 动态秩训练框架有效平衡了计算效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Result: 在五个语义分类任务中优于端到端微调、LoRA、层选择和前缀调优，训练成本减半且稳定性更高。

Conclusion: 令牌驱动的稀疏微调策略是一种高效且稳定的方法，适用于专业分类任务。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Conclusion: 在线TTT方法（如MiGrATe）为无需外部监督的复杂搜索任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了性能，适用于不同内存预算。

Conclusion: GWM和多级协作蒸馏机制有效平衡了OCIL中的稳定性和适应性，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: COGS通过生成数据提升神经求解器的分布鲁棒性，为实际应用提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过预训练提取差异化因子，迭代移除冲突样本，并基于最短距离原则选择伪标签。结合多模态语言模型引入辅助决策因子。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了开源模板，用于满足欧盟AI法案对AI系统技术文档的要求，覆盖数据、模型和应用的全生命周期，确保可追溯性、可重复性和合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统文档模板未能完全满足欧盟AI法案的技术文档要求，尤其是在覆盖整个AI生命周期方面存在不足。

Method: 引入开源模板和示例，用于数据、模型和应用的文档化，并通过用户反馈和实际场景验证其可用性和实施性。

Result: 模板在真实场景中验证有效，如皮肤色调数据集、神经网络模型和建筑工地安全系统的文档化，证明其能支持合规性和负责任AI开发。

Conclusion: TechOps模板可作为实用工具，帮助实现监管合规和负责任AI开发的监督。

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

<details>

Motivation: 电信网络中告警数量庞大且关系复杂，NOC工程师难以快速识别根告警，需要一种更有效的告警关系学习方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为TempOpt的无监督告警关系学习技术，克服了现有时间依赖方法的局限性。

Result: 在真实网络数据集上的实验表明，TempOpt学习的告警关系质量优于时间依赖方法。

Conclusion: TempOpt是一种实用且高效的告警关系学习技术，能够提升根告警识别的准确性和速度。

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer参数过多且难以捕捉非平稳特征，MLP模型在多通道依赖上表现不佳，因此需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: WaveTS-B结合小波变换和MLP捕捉数据特征；WaveTS-M进一步引入MoE框架处理多通道依赖。

Result: 在8个真实数据集上，WaveTS系列模型以更少参数实现SOTA性能，WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: WaveTS系列模型高效且性能优越，尤其适合多通道时间序列预测。

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

Motivation: 生成机器学习在设计表示和探索中具有强大潜力，但受限于需要大量现有设计数据和缺乏对驱动最优性特征的可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种系统化框架，生成内部同质但相互异质的输入原型，用于构建训练数据集，并结合贝叶斯优化增强生成模型的可解释性。

Result: 通过设计流电池歧管的案例验证，框架能有效捕捉可行设计空间，包括新颖配置，并实现高效探索。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提升质量和可靠性，拓宽了生成机器学习模型在系统设计中的适用性。

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出Oblivionis框架，解决联邦学习中LLM的隐私数据选择性遗忘问题，提升合规性和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的LLM缺乏隐私数据选择性遗忘机制，难以满足GDPR等法规要求。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，结合联邦学习和遗忘机制，通过双优化目标实现数据选择性移除。

Result: 实验表明Oblivionis在遗忘效果和模型性能间取得平衡，优于本地训练。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM提供了高效的隐私数据管理方案，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Result: 在精度和稀疏性上优于现有方法，且无需梯度信息。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，同时强调了在复杂任务中评估指标的重要性。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Motivation: 函数空间先验能更直观地将信念嵌入模型输出，但其在BNN中的实现具有挑战性。

Method: 研究通过可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）探索如何适应高复杂度先验并匹配复杂目标函数分布。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐层的BNN，配备灵活可训练激活函数也能有效实现所需函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 可训练激活函数为BNN实现函数空间先验提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度敏感，现有防御方法效果有限。

Conclusion: 阶段转移攻击对持续学习模型构成严重安全威胁，需进一步研究防御方法。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are
available at https://github.com/mcml-official/CSAT.

Conclusion: LNN-PINN为提升PINNs在复杂问题中的预测精度提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering
problems.

Result: 在多组真实数据集上，GenCast显著减少了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理原理，有效解决了无传感器区域的交通预测问题。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在顶点分类任务中表现优异，支持动态邻域聚合。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态力场优化顶点表示，提升了分类任务的性能。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有潜力，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Motivation: 注意力机制在Transformer中扮演核心角色，但其权重信息尚未被充分用于模型解释。研究旨在探索如何利用这些信息丰富现有的XAI技术。

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重可以有效地整合到XAI框架中，显著提升了Transformer模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重为Transformer模型解释提供了有价值的补充信息，丰富了现有的XAI技术。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Conclusion: MechaFormer为传统优化器提供了高质量起点，形成了一种高效的混合设计方法。

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to
improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning
system. Our model is developed with the aim of deployments in edge learning
scenarios, where federated learning over multiple communication rounds can
ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms
multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated

algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse
events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational
electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning
approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific
patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The
OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence
of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper
outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key
assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance.

TL;DR: 论文研究了在不完整网络中预测缺失链接的最佳算法选择问题，通过大规模基准测试比较了多种方法，并提出了基于网络特性的元学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的关系数据（如社交网络或生物模型）通常不完整，现有方法（如模型堆叠或神经网络）在无节点属性的网络中预测缺失链接的效果尚不明确，且算法选择是否依赖网络特性未知。

Method: 使用550个真实网络的大规模基准测试，比较了4种堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器（含2种新方法）和2种图神经网络算法，评估了AUC和Top-k准确率。

Result: 结果显示，没有算法在所有网络中表现最佳；堆叠随机森林方法在AUC上优于或与图神经网络在Top-k上竞争；算法性能强烈依赖网络特性（如度分布、三角密度）。

Conclusion: 提出的元学习算法通过选择最佳算法优化链接预测，性能优于现有方法且可扩展到大网络。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效评估大型语言模型（LLM）性能的方法，通过低成本构建代理模型和动态误差估计，显著减少了数据需求和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动测试方法因计算成本高而难以应用于大型模型，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用上下文学习低成本构建代理模型，无需在主动测试循环中更新，且代理模型可小于目标模型。进一步提出动态误差估计方法。

Result: 该方法能以更少数据更高效地评估LLM性能。

Conclusion: 研究为大规模模型评估提供了一种实用且高效的新方法。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry是一个生成图数据的库，用于测试和评估GNN预测手性的能力。它通过生成具有特定几何和拓扑特征的合成图样本，减少外部干扰，并用于设计新的GNN架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GNN在手性预测任务中的表现，并指导设计更高效的GNN架构。

Method: 生成包含单一手性中心的合成图样本，结合成数据集用于节点分类任务，并测试多种SOTA GNN架构。

Result: 设计出两种新GNN架构：一种通过全连接提高准确性但计算成本高；另一种引入虚拟节点保持线性计算成本且准确性接近SOTA。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN手性预测提供了可解释的基准测试，并成功指导了高效GNN架构的设计。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在几何问题求解（GPS）中表现不佳，主要因为其不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理能力不足。

Method: 结合链式思维（CoT）与形式语言，交替生成自然语言推理和可执行代码；通过监督微调和强化学习优化模型。

Result: GF-Reasoner在标准GPS基准测试中提升了15%的准确率，优于同类7B规模模型及更大的72B模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合自然语言推理和形式语言，显著提升了几何问题求解的效率和准确性，并为未来研究提供了设计参考。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一种通用神经推理模型，用于异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，支持跨数据集特征依赖学习，无需额外调整即可泛化到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据多样且异构，缺乏统一模式，难以构建通用模型。ASPIRE旨在解决这一问题，实现跨数据集语义对齐和预测。

Method: 结合基于集合的Transformer和语义接地模块，利用自然语言描述、元数据和上下文示例学习特征依赖。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中表现优异，支持成本感知的特征获取，适用于开放世界场景。

Conclusion: ASPIRE是实现结构化数据通用语义推理的重要进展。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景（如自动驾驶和医疗）中因校准不足可能导致严重后果，现有方法多忽略欠置信问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案和自适应稀疏性，动态调整掩码保留率以对齐置信度与准确性。

Result: 实验表明MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络提供了可靠置信度估计的实用解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型生成式AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造设计LLM的新组合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究多关注线性架构或专家混合模型，而本文探索利用范畴论中的拓扑性质构建更丰富的LLM架构。

Method: 通过范畴论中的通用构造（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）设计LLM的新组合结构，并验证LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴是完备的且构成拓扑，为新型LLM架构提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 基于范畴论的拓扑性质，为LLM设计提供了新的理论框架和实现可能性。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果模型在处理复杂因果图时存在局限性，而TCMs通过拓扑范畴的性质提供更强大的建模能力。

Method: TCMs基于拓扑范畴的完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象，定义了局部因果机制，并通过（共）极限求解复杂因果图。

Conclusion: TCMs为因果推断提供了更强大的数学工具，支持复杂因果图的建模和推理。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

Result: 在多目标车辆路径问题中，该方法能在短时间内产生良好结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，适用于适应度景观相似的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Conclusion: LLM有望自动化贝叶斯建模的关键步骤，推动概率编程的自动化流程。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户信息不完整或模糊时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 采用FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，整合用户反馈后生成回答。

Result: FATA在实验中比基线提示性能提升40%，稳定性优于专家提示。

Conclusion: FATA通过用户参与和单轮策略，有效提升了LLMs的回答质量和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Result: 实验结果表明，现有KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要改进KG-RAG方法的推理能力和评估标准，以更好地结合知识图谱和语言模型的优势。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

TL;DR: UrzaGPT是一个基于大语言模型的AI，用于在《万智牌》中实时推荐选牌决策，通过微调小模型达到66.2%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于集换式卡牌游戏（CCG）的部分可观察性和复杂决策，现有AI表现远不如人类玩家，因此需要开发更高效的AI模型。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调方法，基于标注的选牌日志数据集，对开源大语言模型进行领域适配。

Result: UrzaGPT在零样本测试中表现优于小模型（如Llama-3-8B），微调后准确率达66.2%，但仍未超越领域专用模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，仅使用大语言模型即可实现选牌AI，未来可开发更通用且易于更新的AI系统。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

### [90] [Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08385)
*Masataro Asai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进MCTS的方法，通过双层修改和树折叠技术，显著减少了节点选择的时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MCTS在经典规划中节点选择时间过长的问题，尤其是在搜索深度大的情况下。

Method: 采用双层MCTS修改，结合预算限制的贪心搜索和树折叠技术。

Result: 实现了节点选择的O(1)时间复杂度，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS的瓶颈问题，适用于经典规划任务。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种避免完全枚举的方法，通过求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，显著提升编译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译时展开循环并生成所有组合，效率低下，尤其是当归纳变量范围大且选择性条件多时。

Method: 利用求解器仅计算必要的组合，避免完全枚举，生成与传统方法相同的约束模型。

Result: 编译速度显著提升，尤其适用于归纳变量范围大且选择性条件多的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法高效地提升了从高级用户模型到求解器就绪形式的转换效率。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦LLM推理的预填充和解码阶段，优化了准确性与效率的权衡，显著提升了生成质量且延迟开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解码器模型统一处理预填充和解码阶段，忽略了它们不同的计算特性，导致高推理成本。

Method: OverFill在预填充阶段使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换到密集剪枝模型并顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B-to-1B配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B-to-3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%。

Conclusion: OverFill在保持性能的同时显著减少训练数据需求，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，引入了动态弧成本变化，适用于仓库操作等实际场景。

Method: 采用GRASP元启发式，结合MIP技术构造问题实例，并使用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate等局部搜索算子优化。

Result: 在MESS 2024竞赛实例中平均最优间隙为0.77%和0.40%，在合成数据集上比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。

Conclusion: 算法在MESS 2024中表现优异，适用于实时路由应用。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

*Parker Whitfill,Stewy Slocum*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，无法系统性地恢复最优模型。通过引入基数反馈（如支付意愿数据），可以更有效地优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法依赖序数偏好数据，但这类数据无法解决模型间的权衡问题，导致无法找到最优模型。

Method: 提出使用基数反馈（如支付意愿数据）替代序数偏好，收集并公开了25,000条基数判断数据集。

Result: 实验表明，结合基数反馈的偏好微调方法能更高效地优化模型，在下游任务（如Arena-Hard）中优于仅依赖序数的方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是解决LLM对齐问题的关键，未来研究应更多关注此类数据收集方法。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Motivation: 尽管POMO在组合问题（如VRP变体）中表现良好，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 改进POMO，提出POMO+方法，通过更智能地利用初始节点寻找解决方案。

Result: 在CVRPLIB数据集上验证，POMO+在多达100个客户的问题实例中表现更优，收敛更快。

Conclusion: POMO+为组合问题的解决提供了进一步改进，有望推动领域发展。

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Motivation: 解决人工验证大规模本体对齐的高成本问题，探索LLM在验证不确定对应关系中的潜力。

Method: 利用LLM验证本体对齐系统中不确定的对应关系，并通过OAEI任务评估不同LLM的性能。

Result: 实验表明LLM在验证不确定对应关系时表现良好，并与模拟Oracle进行了对比。

Conclusion: LLM可作为领域专家的替代方案，降低人工验证成本，但仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试未能充分评估模型在多样化任务中的表现，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用游戏描述语言快速生成新游戏和关卡，避免过拟合，并通过ASCII字符表示游戏场景，便于语言模型处理。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和规划上存在明显不足，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，尤其关注代理行为和上下文推理。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，合成数据是替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和多维评估。

Method: SynLLM采用四种提示类型（如规则约束）指导LLM生成数据，无需微调，并通过统计、临床和隐私多维度评估。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上测试，规则提示在隐私与质量间最佳平衡，LLM可生成临床合理且隐私安全的合成数据。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明LLM在良好提示和评估下能生成高质量合成医疗数据，推动医疗研究数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Result: 在多种PDE和网格几何上表现优越，具有多尺度扩展性和无网格纠缠的误差降低。

Conclusion: UGM2N在网格适应中展现出方程无关的泛化能力和几何独立性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

Conclusion: AgriGPT为农业提供了一个模块化、可扩展的LLM生态系统，并推广了科学和行业专用LLM的开发框架。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而遇到性能瓶颈，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入diminution概念，定义其形式化性质，并通过特定编码利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，平均减少70%的基础时间，基础文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可显著缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Conclusion: 该方法支持医生在患者筛查中逐步获取最有信息量的特征，优化资源利用并提升诊断信心。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism
integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Result: 在JEE和MATH等测试中表现优于现有模型，并提供教学友好的逐步推理。

Conclusion: Aryabhata作为开源小型语言模型，旨在推动考试导向的教育技术进步。

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong
open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through
best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with
group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies
such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both
in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K)
benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency,
while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release
Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small
language models. This marks our first open release for community feedback
(https://huggingface.co/PhysicsWallahAI/Aryabhata-1.0); PW is actively training
future models to further improve learning outcomes for students.

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision框架通过TopoAug数据增强和Frugal Learning方法，提升了多模态任务的推理能力，显著提高了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂多模态任务中表现不佳，且输出冗长，主要依赖链式推理（CoT），而其他拓扑结构可能更有效。

Method: 提出STELAR-Vision框架，结合TopoAug数据增强和Frugal Learning方法，通过监督微调和强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，准确率提升9.7%，超越更大模型Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct 7.3%；在OOD基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision在准确性和泛化能力上显著优于现有方法，为多模态推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于社会认知理论的统一框架，用于设计LLM社交代理，通过动机、行动规划和学习模块实现更灵活、真实的社交行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交代理多为场景定制，缺乏统一框架，限制了其泛化能力和行为一致性。

Method: 基于社会认知理论，设计了包含动机、行动规划和学习三个模块的框架。

Result: 实验表明，该框架代理在复杂条件下能更真实地模拟人类行为，偏差比基线低75%。

Conclusion: 动机、规划和学习模块对生成真实社交行为至关重要，移除任一模块会显著增加误差。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于记忆增强的AR代理框架，旨在解决现有AR系统在复杂多步骤场景中无法利用用户长期经验和偏好的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理在支持即时任务时表现良好，但在需要理解和利用用户长期经验和偏好的复杂多步骤场景中存在局限性。

Method: 提出了一个由四个模块组成的框架：感知模块、记忆模块、时空推理模块和执行模块，用于存储和推理用户的历史交互数据。

Result: 框架展示了在多样化领域中的实际应用潜力，并提供了实现路线图和未来评估策略。

Conclusion: 该工作旨在推动未来研究，开发更智能的AR系统，将用户交互历史与自适应、上下文感知的任务辅助相结合。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的知识编辑分类法，补充现有机制导向的研究，探讨不同编辑方法对各类知识（如事实、时间、概念等）的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）从大规模文本中获取知识，但知识可能过时或不准确。重新训练成本高，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有研究多关注编辑机制，而忽略了知识的功能性分类。

Method: 引入基于功能的分类法，结合知识类型（如事实、时间、概念等）和编辑机制，全面分析现有方法。

Result: 通过双轴分类法（功能与机制）梳理研究现状，总结方法的优缺点，并形式化问题。

Conclusion: 知识编辑领域仍有挑战，未来需进一步探索功能与机制的协同优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出GRainsaCK，一个用于标准化评估知识图谱链接预测解释方法的软件资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱常不完整，现有链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏标准评估协议。

Method: 开发GRainsaCK软件，模块化设计，支持从模型训练到解释评估的全流程。

Result: GRainsaCK实现了标准化评估，提升了模块化和可扩展性，并提供详细文档。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了评估解释方法的空白，促进领域研究。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent框架通过动态规划多模态工具和优化执行序列，显著提升多模态检索增强生成（mRAG）的性能，减少冗余搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有mRAG方法在检索策略和视觉信息利用上的不足，提升实时场景下的表现。

Method: 提出E-Agent框架，包含动态规划的多模态工具协调器和任务执行器，并引入RemPlan基准测试。

Result: E-Agent在多个基准测试中表现优异，准确率提升13%，冗余搜索减少37%。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过动态规划和优化执行，显著提升了mRAG系统的效率和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI（特别是MLLMs）在情感识别任务中的表现，并与人类专家对比，以推动情感智能AI的发展。

Method: 使用RMET和MRMET测试MLLMs和人类的情感识别能力，并比较个体与集体表现。

Result: MLLMs在个体测试中优于人类，但人类集体智慧表现更佳；人机协作（增强智能）效果最佳。

Conclusion: MLLMs在个体情感识别中表现优异，但人类集体智慧和人机协作是未来情感智能AI发展的关键方向。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

Motivation: 当前单代理数学推理系统在同时处理推理和代码生成时存在认知负载干扰问题，导致推理路径正确率下降。

Method: 采用双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成与执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，双代理框架显著减少了认知干扰，推理路径正确率提升。

Conclusion: 双代理设计有效解决了单代理系统的认知干扰问题，提升了推理与代码生成的协调性。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex

involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B

Result: 简单上下文学习能显著减少多模态隐式威胁。

Conclusion: 需改进跨模态隐式推理以提升安全性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the

Motivation: 探讨前景理论在LLMs中的适用性，以及语言不确定性标记对LLMs决策行为的影响。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出评估框架，引入不确定性标记及其对应概率值。

Result: PT对LLMs决策建模的可靠性不一致，尤其在语言表达不确定性时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLMs中的应用存在局限性，语言不确定性标记影响其决策行为。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可能放大有害偏见，传统方法（如数据过滤或后处理）效果有限且不透明。

Method: 1. 训练线性“探针”检测模型内部激活中的偏见表征；2. 计算“导向向量”对比偏见与中性语句的激活模式，实时调整生成内容。

Result: 实验表明探针能近乎完美识别偏见，激活导向技术成功将偏见生成转向中性内容。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更安全、可解释的LLMs提供了直接且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征交互的XGBoost模型（FiXGBoost），用于预测乘客在提交乘车请求前的等待时间，填补了现有研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注已知司机信息后的等待时间预测，而乘客在提交请求前的等待时间预测同样重要，但目前研究不足。

Method: 通过数据驱动分析供需动态对等待时间的影响，并基于特征工程提出FiXGBoost模型。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集（3000万条记录）上，FiXGBoost表现出色且具有高解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为预请求等待时间预测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度神经网络的预测性维护框架，用于早期检测铁路轨道电路中的异常，以提高维护效率和减少停机时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨道电路是铁路运营的关键，其故障可能导致连锁反应。传统方法难以早期检测细微异常，因此需要更先进的预测性维护技术。

Method: 利用深度神经网络分类异常，并通过符合性预测提供不确定性估计。

Result: 在10个CVCM故障案例中验证，整体准确率达99.31%，检测时间在异常出现的1%内。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和适应性，可提升全球铁路系统的操作可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的方法SMA，用于在多模态检索增强生成系统中追踪生成内容的来源，解决了现有方法无法区分预训练、外部检索或用户输入的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法可靠地追踪生成内容的来源，导致隐私泄露责任不明确。

Method: 提出SMA方法，通过半黑盒设置和零阶优化机制实现细粒度来源追踪，并引入跨模态归因技术。

Result: SMA能够有效区分生成内容的来源，首次实现了对图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA为复杂生成系统中的数据来源审计提供了新视角，将关注点从数据是否被记忆转移到内容来源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

TL;DR: OpenCUA是一个开源框架，用于扩展计算机使用代理（CUA）的数据和基础模型，包括标注工具、数据集和模型，性能超越现有开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在计算机任务中的商业潜力增长，研究社区需要开源框架以研究其能力、局限性和风险。

Method: OpenCUA框架包括标注基础设施、大规模数据集AgentNet和可扩展的演示转换管道，支持长链推理。

Result: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified上的平均成功率为34.8%，超越GPT-4o等模型。

Conclusion: OpenCUA为CUA研究提供了开放基础，其方法在跨领域泛化和计算扩展方面表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

TL;DR: BrowseMaster是一个基于规划-执行代理对的可扩展框架，旨在解决LLM代理在信息搜索中的广度和深度限制，通过高效检索和连贯推理提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代理在信息搜索中难以平衡搜索广度和推理深度，导致效率低下和结果不连贯。

Method: 提出BrowseMaster框架，包含规划器和执行器：规划器制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索，提供简洁证据。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中，BrowseMaster表现优异，得分分别为30.0和46.5，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster通过分工协作解决了现有代理的局限性，适用于复杂的信息搜索任务。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于纳米孔的DNA存储的可实现速率，使用不依赖碱基调用算法的通道模型解码纳米孔信号，并提出简化的消息传递算法。通过动态时间规整（DTW）算法评估可实现速率，并在公开数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决纳米孔信号解码中缺乏DNA存储数据集的问题，并提出一种不依赖碱基调用算法的通道模型。

Method: 方法包括使用NNC-Scrappie通道模型生成输出信号，并推导简化的消息传递算法进行软解码。通过DTW算法评估可实现速率。

Result: 结果表明，在100个碱基长度的DNA链上，可实现速率为0.64-1.18 bits/碱基，平均为0.96 bits/碱基。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法在单次读取条件下可实现较高速率，但结果较为保守，未考虑特定纳米孔的校准。

Abstract: This paper studies achievable rates of nanopore-based DNA storage when
nanopore signals are decoded using a tractable channel model that does not rely
on a basecalling algorithm. Specifically, the noisy nanopore channel (NNC) with
the Scrappie pore model generates average output levels via i.i.d. geometric
sample duplications corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise (NNC-Scrappie).
Simplified message passing algorithms are derived for efficient soft decoding
of nanopore signals using NNC-Scrappie. Previously, evaluation of this channel
model was limited by the lack of DNA storage datasets with nanopore signals
included. This is solved by deriving an achievable rate based on the dynamic
time-warping (DTW) algorithm that can be applied to genomic sequencing datasets
subject to constraints that make the resulting rate applicable to DNA storage.
Using a publicly-available dataset from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), it
is demonstrated that coding over multiple DNA strands of $100$ bases in length
and decoding with the NNC-Scrappie decoder can achieve rates of at least
$0.64-1.18$ bits per base, depending on the channel quality of the nanopore
that is chosen in the sequencing device per channel-use, and $0.96$ bits per
base on average assuming uniformly chosen nanopores. These rates are
pessimistic since they only apply to single reads and do not include
calibration of the pore model to specific nanopores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Reed-Muller码解码器需要多步处理，后续算法虽减少步骤但存在局限性。本文旨在设计一种单步解码器，同时实现最优纠错和擦除恢复能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的单步硬判决解码器，可同时解码所有消息符号，并证明了其纠错和擦除恢复的理论极限。

Result: 该解码器能在单步内纠正最多d_min/4错误，并在擦除设置中恢复最多d_min-1符号，达到理论极限。

Conclusion: 这是首个同时实现最优擦除恢复和最大单步纠错能力的Reed-Muller码单步解码器。

Abstract: The classical majority-logic decoder proposed by Reed for Reed-Muller codes
RM(r, m) of order r and length 2^m, unfolds in r+1 sequential steps, decoding
message symbols from highest to lowest degree. Several follow-up decoding
algorithms reduced the number of steps, but for a limited set of parameters, or
at the expense of reduced performance, or relying on the existence of some
combinatorial structures. We show that any one-step majority-logic decoder-that
is, a decoder performing all majority votes in one step simultaneously without
sequential processing-can correct at most d_min/4 errors for all values of r
and m, where d_min denotes the code's minimum distance. We then introduce a new
hard-decision decoder that completes the decoding in a single step and attains
this error-correction limit. It applies to all r and m, and can be viewed as a
parallel realization of Reed's original algorithm, decoding all message symbols
simultaneously. Remarkably, we also prove that the decoder is optimum in the
erasure setting: it recovers the message from any erasure pattern of up to
d_min-1 symbols-the theoretical limit. To our knowledge, this is the first
1-step decoder for RM codes that achieves both optimal erasure correction and
the maximum one-step error correction capability.

Motivation: 物联网环境中的异构数据存储和传输面临资源限制，传统算术编码计算复杂度高，需优化以适应实时应用。

Method: 结合迭代优化、PCA降维和基数减少技术，改进算术编码算法。

Result: 优化算法压缩比达814:1，单图压缩时间101毫秒，显著降低资源消耗。

Conclusion: 优化算法适合资源受限的物联网环境，支持高效数据传输和存储。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) generates vast amounts of heterogeneous data,
ranging from sensor readings to log alerts and images, that pose challenges to
storage and data transmission in resource-constrained environments. In this
context, lossless data compression techniques, like Arithmetic Coding, offer an
effective solution owing to their high compression ratio. However, the standard
Arithmetic Coding technique is computationally intensive, leading to high
memory and processing overhead. This paper proposes an optimized version of
Arithmetic coding for the IoT environment that incorporates three improvements
using Iterative and Iteration Optimizations for minimizing redundant
computations and achieving faster convergence; Principal Component
Analysis(PCA) for dimensionality reduction and identifying key features; and
lastly, Cardinality reduction for grouping similar probabilities to improve the
compression efficiency. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of
images and demonstrated significant reductions in the time to compress, CPU
utilization, and memory consumption, and preserves data integrity as seen
through the low RMSE values. The optimized version of the Arithmetic Coding
algorithm achieves an impressive compression ratio of 814:1 and 101 ms to
compress a single image. This makes the optimized algorithm suitable for
real-time applications and resource-constrained environments for efficient data
transmission and storage.

Motivation: 传统云存储模型存在延迟、安全性和高成本问题，而现有的IPFS与区块链结合方案计算效率低且成本高。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了一个双向数据存储与检索系统，动态监控设备数据并传输至IPFS，记录CID到区块链，通过智能合约实现实时访问。进一步优化为轻量级Python框架。

Result: 实验显示，新框架将500MB文件上传时间从117.12秒降至7.63秒（提升93.47%），进一步优化后降至4.2秒（再提升45%）。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、安全，适用于实时和关键物联网应用，优于现有IPFS-智能合约解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of IoT data demands efficient, secure, and scalable
storage solutions on one hand, and efficient data migration and retrieval on
the other hand are essential for the systems to be practical and acceptable for
different applications. The traditional cloud-based models face latency,
security, and high operational costs, while existing bi-directional data
storage and retrieval-based IPFS models are not computationally efficient and
incur high gas costs at the cost of a necessary blockchain deployment. To
overcome the challenges of efficient data migration, we initially developed a
2-way data storage and retrieval system as well as a scalable framework that
dynamically monitors and transfers device-generated data to IPFS, records the
content identifier(CID) on a blockchain, and enables secure, real-time access
via smart contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that the existing work
achieved an average data upload time of 117.12 sec for a file size of 500 MB;
our framework achieves a faster upload time of 7.63 sec, marking a 93.47%
improvement. We further optimize the proposed framework to reduce the file
upload time incurred from the smart contracts by introducing a
blockchain-inspired, lightweight, and customizable Python framework that
replicates the storage and retrieval functionalities of a traditional
blockchain, where the file upload time is 4.2 sec, further optimized by 45%
from our previous approach, thus demonstrating its efficiency, security and
suitability for deploy ment in real-time and critical IoT applications and
outperforming the existing IPFS-smart contract based solutions.

Motivation: 研究GB码的最小距离及其在量子纠错中的应用，以填补经典编码技术无法覆盖的空白。

Method: 通过分析低权重逻辑Pauli操作和构建容错逻辑CNOT门，同时设计不降低最小距离的综合征提取模式。

Result: 发现两种GB码家族，参数分别为$[[d^2+1,2,d]]$和$[[d^2,2,d]]$，逻辑错误率阈值约为14-16%。

Conclusion: GB码在容错量子计算中具有潜力，性能与旋转表面码相似。

Abstract: We present new upper and lower bounds on the minimum distance of certain
generalized bicycle (GB) codes beyond the reach of techniques for classical
codes capable of even capturing the true minimum distance for some cases. These
bounds are then applied to illustrate the existence and analyze two highly
degenerate GB code families with parameters $[[d^2+1,2,d]]$ for odd $d \geq 3$
and $[[d^2,2,d]]$ for even $d \geq 4$, both having the property that each check
qubit is connected to exactly four data qubits similar to surface codes. For
the odd-distance family, we analyze the structure of low-weight logical Pauli
operators and demonstrate the existence of a fault-tolerant logical CNOT gate
between the two logical qubits, achievable through a simple relabeling of data
qubits. We further construct a syndrome extraction pattern for both families
that does not imply minimum distance reduction arising from extraction circuit
faults that propagate from the check qubits to the data qubits. Finally, we
numerically evaluate their logical error rates under a code capacity
depolarizing noise model using the belief propagation ordered statistics
decoding (BP-OSD) and minimum-weight perfect-matching (MWPM) decoders, yielding
thresholds of approximately $14-16\%$ for the odd and even families, very
similar to those of rotated surface codes.

Motivation: 人类决策具有风险厌恶和有限理性的特点，RQE能更真实地描述战略环境中的决策行为，但其计算问题尚未完全解决。

Method: 在标准形式博弈中采用单调性方法，证明RQE的唯一性和Lipschitz连续性；在无限时域马尔可夫博弈中定义风险厌恶量化响应Bellman算子并证明其收缩性。

Result: 在标准形式博弈中，RQE在单调性条件下唯一且连续；在无限时域马尔可夫博弈中，Bellman算子的收缩性为Q学习算法提供了收敛保证。

Conclusion: RQE的计算在多种博弈模型中可行，为多智能体强化学习提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: Risk-aversion and bounded rationality are two key characteristics of human
decision-making. Risk-averse quantal-response equilibrium (RQE) is a solution
concept that incorporates these features, providing a more realistic depiction
of human decision making in various strategic environments compared to a Nash
equilibrium. Furthermore a class of RQE has recently been shown in
arXiv:2406.14156 to be universally computationally tractable in all
finite-horizon Markov games, allowing for the development of multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms with convergence guarantees. In this paper,
we expand upon the study of RQE and analyze their computation in both
two-player normal form games and discounted infinite-horizon Markov games. For
normal form games we adopt a monotonicity-based approach allowing us to
generalize previous results. We first show uniqueness and Lipschitz continuity
of RQE with respect to player's payoff matrices under monotonicity assumptions,
and then provide conditions on the players' degrees of risk aversion and
bounded rationality that ensure monotonicity. We then focus on discounted
infinite-horizon Markov games. We define the risk-averse quantal-response
Bellman operator and prove its contraction under further conditions on the
players' risk-aversion, bounded rationality, and temporal discounting. This
yields a Q-learning based algorithm with convergence guarantees for all
infinite-horizon general-sum Markov games.

Result: 多项式时间算法可判断是否存在解；在物品数量受限时问题变得难解。

Conclusion: 研究提供了解决嫉妒问题的高效方法，并揭示了问题的计算复杂性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of resolving the envy of a given initial allocation
by adding elements from a pool of goods. We give a characterization of the
instances where envy can be resolved by adding an arbitrary number of copies of
the items in the pool. From this characterization, we derive a polynomial-time
algorithm returning a respective solution if it exists. If the number of copies
or the total number of added items are bounded, the problem becomes
computationally intractable even in various restricted cases. We perform a
parameterized complexity analysis, focusing on the number of agents and the
pool size as parameters. Notably, although not every instance admits an
envy-free solution, our approach allows us to efficiently determine, in
polynomial time, whether a solution exists-an aspect that is both theoretically
interesting and far from trivial.

Abstract: Online bidding is crucial in mobile ecosystems, enabling real-time ad

problem, as it directly enhances the economic outcomes for all participants in
advertising platforms. This paper investigates the design of optimal boost
factors in online bidding while incorporating quality value (the impact of
displayed ads on publishers' long-term benefits). To address the divergent
interests on quality, we establish a three-party auction framework with a
unified welfare metric of advertiser and publisher. Within this framework, we
derive the theoretical efficiency lower bound for C-competitive boost in
second-price single-slot auctions, then design a novel quality-involved
Boosting (q-Boost) algorithm for computing the optimal boost factor.
Experimental validation on Alibaba's public dataset (AuctionNet) demonstrates
2%-6% welfare improvements over conventional approaches, proving our method's
effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a
set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual
costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the
computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our
results show that while optimizing the former is computationally
straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in
very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this
problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation
algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its
impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online
algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing
insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments.
Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our
setting.
