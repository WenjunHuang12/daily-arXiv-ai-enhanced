However, manual or semi-manual entry of\nstructured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow\nturnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate\ndescriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing\nretrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss\nfine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.\n  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for\ngenerating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a\nfine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key\nchallenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality\ngaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data\nrefinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures\nalignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual\nUnderstanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained\ninformation from visual inputs.\n  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference\noptimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving\nrobustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on\nreal-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms\nbaseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These\nresults demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and\ntextual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item\ndescriptions.

By keeping data local and relying on a central server to coordinate\ntraining across distributed clients, FedRSs protect user privacy while\ncollaboratively learning global models. However, most existing FedRS frameworks\nadopt fully random client selection strategy in each training round,\noverlooking the statistical heterogeneity of user data arising from diverse\npreferences and behavior patterns, thereby resulting in suboptimal model\nperformance. While some client selection strategies have been proposed in the\nbroader federated learning literature, these methods are typically designed for\ngeneric tasks and fail to address the unique challenges of recommendation\nscenarios, such as expensive contribution evaluation due to the large number of\nclients, and sparse updates resulting from long-tail item distributions. To\nbridge this gap, we propose ProxyRL-FRS, a proxy model-guided reinforcement\nlearning framework tailored for client selection in federated recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first introduce ProxyNCF, a dual-branch model deployed on each\nclient, which augments standard Neural Collaborative Filtering with an\nadditional proxy model branch that provides lightweight contribution\nestimation, thus eliminating the need for expensive per-round local training\ntraditionally required to evaluate a client's contribution. Furthermore, we\ndesign a staleness-aware SA reinforcement learning agent that selects clients\nbased on the proxy-estimated contribution, and is guided by a reward function\nbalancing recommendation accuracy and embedding staleness, thereby enriching\nthe update coverage of item embeddings. Experiments conducted on public\nrecommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ProxyRL-FRS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aProxyRL-FRS\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08FedRS\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u5168\u968f\u673a\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProxyRL-FRS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecProxyNCF\uff08\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548cSA\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d21\u732e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u63a8\u8350\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ProxyRL-FRS\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ProxyRL-FRS\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose\na formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial\ncomplementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial\nbranch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative\nanalysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show\nthe relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of\ncomputing an approximate Nash equilibrium.

However, their lack of\ncollaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative\nand generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced\nvarious alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage\nframework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable\ninformation loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive\nalignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information\nmaximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we\npropose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method\nthat simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic\nintegrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically\nassociated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient\nalignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the\nfollowing two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative\nAlignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and\ncollaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and\nthen design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item\n(u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence\nitem-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual\nquantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads\nachieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments\nand online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully\ndeployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400\nmillion users daily.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDAS\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u53cc\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49ID\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49ID\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u8350\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u53cc\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49ID\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eDAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5df2\u5728\u5feb\u624bApp\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6bcf\u65e5\u670d\u52a1\u8d85\u8fc74\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "DAS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49ID\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The search time is normalized by the target's\ndistance to the origin, following the standard convention in competitive\nanalysis. The goal is to minimize the maximum such normalized time over all\ntarget locations, the search cost. As a base case, we extend the known result\nfor a single unit-speed agent, which achieves an optimal cost of about\n$\\mathcal{U}_1 = 17.28935$ via a logarithmic spiral, to $n$ unit-speed agents.\nWe give a symmetric spiral-based algorithm where each agent follows a\nlogarithmic spiral offset by equal angular phases. This yields a search cost\nindependent of which agent finds the target. We provide a closed-form upper\nbound $\\mathcal{U}_n$ for this setting, which we use in our general result. Our\nmain contribution is an upper bound on the worst-case normalized search time\nfor $n$ agents with arbitrary speeds. We give a framework that selects a subset\nof agents and assigns spiral-type trajectories with speed-dependent angular\noffsets, again making the search cost independent of which agent reaches the\ntarget. A corollary shows that $n$ multi-speed agents (fastest speed 1) can\nbeat $k$ unit-speed agents (cost below $\\mathcal{U}_k$) if the geometric mean\nof their speeds exceeds $\\mathcal{U}_n / \\mathcal{U}_k$. This means slow agents\nmay be excluded if they lower the mean too much, motivating non-spiral\nalgorithms. We also give new upper bounds for point search in cones and conic\ncomplements using a single unit-speed agent. These are then used to design\nhybrid spiral-directional strategies, which outperform the spiral-based\nalgorithms when some agents are slow. This suggests that spiral-type\ntrajectories may not be optimal in the general multi-speed setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u901f\u5ea6\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u641c\u7d22\u9690\u85cf\u70b9\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u87ba\u65cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u534f\u540c\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u87ba\u65cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u504f\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u87ba\u65cb\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u87ba\u65cb-\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u975e\u87ba\u65cb\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u87ba\u65cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u591a\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee3\u7406\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6162\u901f\u4ee3\u7406\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

Experiments on time series models typically focus on\ndemonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline\nsolutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that\nforecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners\noften value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.\nAssuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary\ndrastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human\nintervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose\ntrust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which\nquantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when\nthe set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.\n  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast\naccuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time\nseries forecasting.

To\naccelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative\nrecommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\\alpha$, identifying two efficiency\nbottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and\nthe computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that\nrelative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as\nattention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative\nforms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the\nquestion of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical\nexperiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade\nthe model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks,\nwe propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation\nmodels. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which\navoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,\nthereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key\nattention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new\nAttention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to\nFuXi-$\\alpha$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$\\beta$. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\\beta$ outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to\nFuXi-$\\alpha$, while also adhering to the scaling law.

Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and\nstructured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints\nspecified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM\noutput is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has\nproposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to\nparticular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the\nemerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as\nthe generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the\npreviously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then\nreduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the\ntarget language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient\nalgorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various\napplications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in\nJSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness\nwhile consistently preserving or improving functional correctness.

Existing methods suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1)\nrestricted ability to represent rich multimodal features through a single\nrepresentation, (2) existing linear modality fusion strategies ignore the deep\nnonlinear correlations between modalities, and (3) static optimization methods\nfailing to dynamically mitigate the over-smoothing problem in graph\nconvolutional network (GCN). To overcome these limitations, we propose HPMRec,\na novel Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation framework, which\nutilizes hypercomplex embeddings in the form of multi-components to enhance the\nrepresentation diversity of multimodal features. HPMRec adopts the hypercomplex\nmultiplication to naturally establish nonlinear cross-modality interactions to\nbridge semantic gaps, which is beneficial to explore the cross-modality\nfeatures.

Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,\nsuffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter\ntuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a\nnovel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by\ndisentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific\nfactors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity\nin user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation\nfactors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average\ntraining losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an\nempirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This\ndesign is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two\nintuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and\nAmazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that\nCrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

At its\nheart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with\nknowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving\nfine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected\ninto the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a\nconversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a\nrecommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent\ncandidates.

A persisting challenge\nis model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more\nmixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we\ndevelop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for\noverspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown\n$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the\npopulation level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we\nestablish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$\nsteps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe\nsublinear convergence in $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the\n$\\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample\nlevel, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we\ndemonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with\nsufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$\ngiven $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our\npopulation level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final\naccuracy $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the\nfinite-sample level, namely letting $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for\nsufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$\nfor sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration\ncomplexity bounds $O(\\log (1/\\epsilon))=O(\\log (n/d))$ and\n$O(\\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently\nunbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights.

To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research\nframework based on the classic \"Turtle Soup\" game, integrating a benchmark, an\nagent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first\nlarge-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,\ncomprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert\nauthors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'\nperformance in this setting.

To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved\ntowards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level\nsummaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,\nunaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected\n``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community\nreasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often\ndegenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's\nrich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework\nthat features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and\nretrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation\nalgorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations\namong aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.\nThen, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the\nmost relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the\ngraph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive\nevidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated\nwith path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.\nExtensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains\ndemonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in\nresponse quality while reducing 46\\% retrieval redundancy.

At any training epoch,\nthe states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs\nthan in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two\ntechniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques\nwere (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many\npotentially \"important\" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if\nnot high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling\ntechniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at\nlater than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the\ntraining when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful\ndifferences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the\nfailure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement\nwhen using D-Wave-based sampling.

AKI stems from complex\nhemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection\nessential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment\nwith intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable\nmachine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with\ncirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,\nidentifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU\nstays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological\nvariables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included\npreprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class\nbalancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,\nnaive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,\naccuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI\n0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged\npartial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,\nand altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting\nactionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk\nstratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.\nIts high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk\npatients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.\nExternal validation and integration into electronic health record systems are\nwarranted.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24\uff08AKI\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u809d\u786c\u5316\u60a3\u8005\u4e2dAKI\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u9884\u540e\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408ICU\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56de\u987e\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86MIMIC-IV v2.2\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u4e861240\u540d\u809d\u786c\u5316ICU\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8648\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u5305\u62ecLightGBM\u7b496\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "LightGBM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08AUROC 0.808\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u73870.704\uff09\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u5305\u62ec\u90e8\u5206\u51dd\u8840\u6d3b\u9176\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\u3001\u4f4epH\u503c\u7b49\uff0c\u4e0e\u809d\u786c\u5316AKI\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u809d\u786c\u5316ICU\u60a3\u8005\u7684AKI\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u9634\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9884\u9632\u3002"}}

While\nartificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is\ntransforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to\nphysicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific\nmedical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the\nability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous\ncomplaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's\nability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship\nbetween physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with\nphysicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM\nendowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the\nfull-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement.

Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize\nrecurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to\ncapture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this\npaper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline\ndecomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the\nproblem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component\ndecomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method\nfirst determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component\nsolely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm.

In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedKEI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff0cFedKEI\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "FedKEI\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u96c6\u7fa4\u548c\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u3001\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u548c\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFedKEI\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u75be\u75c5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedKEI\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are\nmore comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that\nmultimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0879\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u548c\u56db\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u539f\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u5206\u6790XAI\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u6bd4\u8be6\u7ec6\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u6613\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "XAI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5448\u73b0\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade\nincreased computation for reduced memory operations.

For every node, we construct a structured\ncontext vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,\nclustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A\nlightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation\nvector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent\nembedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural\nlanguage explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)\nguiding the GNN itself via a \"text-injection\" mechanism that feeds explanations\nback into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph\ndatasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,\nand GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive\nclassification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.\nRepository: https://github.com/basiralab/X-Node.", "AI": {"tldr": "X-Node\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002", "motivation": "GNN\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "X-Node\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u5230\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728MedMNIST\u548cMorphoMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cX-Node\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "X-Node\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GNN\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures\nsuch as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may\nrequire non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for\nirregular data like brain connectomes.

Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the\nintroduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling\ntasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application\nscenario is improved by 13%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08GATs\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u5e94\u7528\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08GATs\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRMSE\u964d\u4f4e9%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad813%\u3002", "conclusion": "GATs\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We release our dataset at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},\nand will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\\ourdataset\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3AI\u9a71\u52a8\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8fdd\u53cd\u9690\u542b\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u81f4\u7a81\u53d8\u6027\uff09\u3002\\ourdataset\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u4ece\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b3230\u4e07\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u3001CLIP\u548cLLava\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728TDC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\\ourdataset\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff081500\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e20\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684TxGemma\uff0c\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd190\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\\ourdataset\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
