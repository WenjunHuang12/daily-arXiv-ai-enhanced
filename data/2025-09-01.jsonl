Specifically, the receiver holds a set\nof hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has\nincomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth.\nThe transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver\nidentify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the\nobjective as approximating the posterior distribution at the transmitter to the\nreceiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained,\nfinite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\nconditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's\nnon-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality.\nBased on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and\nmulti-round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an m-ary\nBayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule,\nour communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget\nconstraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical\nfindings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection\nand prior methods."}

The OSI property is a\nrelatively weak assumption on a random matrix that holds when the matrix\npreserves the length of vectors on average and, with high probability, does not\nannihilate any vector in a low-dimensional subspace. With the OSI abstraction,\nthe analysis of a randomized linear algebra algorithm factors into two parts:\n(i) proving that the algorithm works when implemented with an OSI; and (ii)\nproving that a given random matrix model has the OSI property.\n  This paper develops both parts of the program. First, it analyzes standard\nrandomized algorithms for low-rank approximation and least-squares regression\nunder the OSI assumption. Second, it identifies many examples of OSIs,\nincluding random sparse matrices, randomized trigonometric transforms, and\nrandom matrices with tensor product structure.

To address this gap, this paper\npresents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built\non the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and\ncontinuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny)\nfrom 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline\nemploys a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window\nsegmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and\nz-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative\ninput vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three\ncomplementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged\npolarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion\nclassification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted.\n(iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10\nordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random\nForest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM,\nLSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently\noutperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence\ntask and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion\nclassification."}

Forgetting has many\nfacets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a\nconditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing\nforgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable\nelimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to\nfocus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic\nprogramming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief\nrevision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical\ndeduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we\ntake an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic\nstates with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional\nlogic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic\nbackground means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to\nthe epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and\ninstantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking\nfunctions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic\nprogramming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating\nforgetting operations.

To address these issues and enhance the\nmodel's efficiency and accuracy, we introduce Deep Multimodal Group Interest\nNetwork (DMGIN).

In contrast, sharp minima are typically more\nsensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins.

Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes.

By leveraging domain-approved\nconnections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical\nconcept representations by incorporating contextual information from related\nconcepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating\ndomain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology\nsystems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without\nintegrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept\nrepresentation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,\noverlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a\nlarge language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework\nthat leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis\nknowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to\nenhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first\nemploys LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology\nconcept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept\ndescriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our\nmethod jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by\nperforming knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical\npropagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology\nhorizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive\nexperiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of\nLINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with\nexisting EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness\nin scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction."}

We first\ncharacterize the games for which successful steering is possible. Moreover, we\nestablish that steering players to any desired action profile is not always\nachievable with information design alone, nor when accompanied with sublinear\npayment schemes. Consequently, we derive a lower bound on the constant payments\nrequired per round to achieve this goal. To address these limitations incurred\nwith information design, we introduce an augmented approach that involves a\none-shot information design phase before the start of the repeated game,\ntransforming the prior interaction into a Stackelberg game. Finally, we\ntheoretically demonstrate that this approach improves the convergence rate of\nplayers' action profiles to the target point by a constant factor with high\nprobability, and support it with empirical results."}
