However, current approaches struggle with cue-level perception and reasoning due to two main challenges: 1) general-purpose modality encoders are pretrained to capture global structures and general semantics rather than fine-grained emotional cues, resulting in limited sensitivity to emotional signals; and 2) available datasets usually involve a trade-off between annotation quality and scale, which leads to insufficient supervision for emotional cues and ultimately limits cue-level reasoning. Moreover, existing evaluation metrics are inadequate for assessing cue-level reasoning performance. To address these challenges, we propose eXplainable Emotion GPT (XEmoGPT), a novel EMER framework capable of both perceiving and reasoning over emotional cues. It incorporates two specialized modules: the Video Emotional Cue Bridge (VECB) and the Audio Emotional Cue Bridge (AECB), which enhance the video and audio encoders through carefully designed tasks for fine-grained emotional cue perception. To further support cue-level reasoning, we construct a large-scale dataset, EmoCue, designed to teach XEmoGPT how to reason over multimodal emotional cues. In addition, we introduce EmoCue-360, an automated metric that extracts and matches emotional cues using semantic similarity, and release EmoCue-Eval, a benchmark of 400 expert-annotated samples covering diverse emotional scenarios. Experimental results show that XEmoGPT achieves strong performance in both emotional cue perception and reasoning."}

In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\\log n$ for a constant $C\\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$."}

Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction."}

AutoPrunedRetriever stores entities and relations in a compact, ID-indexed codebook and represents questions, facts, and answers as edge sequences, enabling retrieval and prompting over symbolic structure instead of raw text. To keep the graph compact, we apply a two-layer consolidation policy (fast ANN/KNN alias detection plus selective $k$-means once a memory threshold is reached) and prune low-value structure, while prompts retain only overlap representatives and genuinely new evidence. We instantiate two front ends: AutoPrunedRetriever-REBEL, which uses REBEL as a triplet parser, and AutoPrunedRetriever-llm, which swaps in an LLM extractor. On GraphRAG-Benchmark (Medical and Novel), both variants achieve state-of-the-art complex reasoning accuracy, improving over HippoRAG2 by roughly 9--11 points, and remain competitive on contextual summarize and generation.

Building on prior work that considers single-package delivery across networks using multiple types of collaborative agents with restricted movement areas (e.g., drones or trucks), we examine the complexity of the problem under structural and operational constraints. Our focus is on minimizing total delivery time by coordinating agents that differ in speed and movement range across a graph. This problem formulation aligns with the recently proposed Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT), introduced by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022].\n  We first resolve an open question posed by Erlebach et al. [ISAAC 2022] by showing that even when the delivery network is a path graph, DDT admits no polynomial-time approximation within any polynomially encodable factor $a(n)$, unless P=NP. Additionally, we identify the intersection graph of the agents, where nodes represent agents and edges indicate an overlap of the movement areas of two agents, as an important structural concept. For path graphs, we show that DDT becomes tractable when parameterized by the treewidth $w$ of the intersection graph, and we present an exact FPT algorithm with running time $f(w)\\cdot\\text{poly}(n,k)$, for some computable function $f$. For general graphs, we give an FPT algorithm with running time $f(Δ,w)\\cdot\\text{poly}(n,k)$, where $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the intersection graph.

As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs."}

[2024] show that a Global Budget Balance (GBB) constraint on the profit -- enforced over the entire time horizon -- can improve the GFT by a multiplicative factor of two. While this might appear to be a marginal relaxation, this implies that all existing WBB-focused algorithms suffer linear regret when measured against the GBB optimum. In this work, we provide the first algorithm to achieve sublinear regret against the GBB benchmark in stochastic environments under one-bit feedback.

This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\\times$ faster measurement, a 98\\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems."}

We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead.

[JAAMAS 2020]. We extend this by studying a novel succinct variant that is related to modified fractional hedonic games. In our model, each agent has a fixed type-value and an agent's cost for some given coalition is based on the differences between its value and those of the other members of its coalition. This allows to model natural situations like athletes forming training groups with similar performance levels or voters that partition themselves along a political spectrum.\n  In particular, we investigate natural variants where an agent's cost is defined by distance thresholds, or by the maximum or average value difference to the other agents in its coalition. For these settings, we study the existence of stable coalition structures, their properties, and their quality in terms of the price of anarchy and the price of stability. Further, we investigate the impact of limiting the maximum number of coalitions. Despite the simple setting with metric distances on a line, we uncover a rich landscape of models, partially with counter-intuitive behavior. Also, our focus on both swap stability and jump stability allows us to study the influence of fixing the number and the size of the coalitions. Overall, we find that stable coalition structures always exist but that their properties and quality can vary widely."}

While this simplifies the usage, developers must be aware of non-uniform memory access (NUMA), where an access by a thread running on a core-local NUMA region is significantly cheaper than an access from a core-remote region. Obviously, if query answering is parallelized across the cores of multiple regions, then the portion of the database on which the query is operating should be distributed across the same regions to ensure local accesses. As the present data placement might not fit this, migrating pages from one NUMA region to another can be performed to improve the situation. To do so, different options exist: One option is to rely on automatic NUMA balancing integrated in Linux, which is steered by the observed access patterns and frequency. Another option is to actively trigger migration via the system call move_pages(). Unfortunately, both variants have significant downsides in terms of their feature set and performance. As an alternative, we propose a new user-space migration method called page_leap() that can perform page migration asynchronously at a high performance by exploiting features of the virtual memory subsystem. The method is (a) actively triggered by the user, (b) ensures that all pages are eventually migrated, (c) handles concurrent writes correctly, (d) supports pooled memory, (e) adaptively adjusts its migration granularity based on the workload, and (f) supports both small pages and huge pages."}

To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity."}

When generating this plan, a central decision is how to physically represent all involved relations, an aspect in which existing Datalog engines are surprisingly restrictive and often resort to one-size-fits-all solutions. The reason for this is that the typical execution plan of a Datalog program not only performs a single type of operation against the physical representations, but a mixture of operations, such as insertions, lookups, and containment-checks. Further, the relevance of each operation type highly depends on the workload characteristics, which range from familiar properties such as the size, multiplicity, and arity of the individual relations to very specific Datalog properties, such as the \"interweaving\" of rules when relations occur multiple times, and in particular the recursiveness of the query which might generate new tuples on the fly during evaluation. This indicates that a variety of physical representations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, is required to meet the specific needs of different workload situations. To evaluate this, we conduct an in-depth experimental study of the interplay between potentially suitable physical representations and seven dimensions of workload characteristics that vary across actual Datalog programs, revealing which properties actually matter. Based on these insights, we design an automatic selection mechanism that utilizes a set of decision trees to identify suitable physical representations for a given workload."}

In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance.

We argue that the predominant approach of fixing the hash function for the lifetime of the hash table is suboptimal and propose adapting it to the current set of keys. In the prevailing view, good hash functions spread the keys ``randomly'' and are fast to evaluate. General-purpose ones (e.g. Murmur) are designed to do both while remaining agnostic to the distribution of the keys, which limits their bucketing ability and wastes computation. When these shortcomings are recognized, one may specify a hash function more tailored to some assumed key distribution, but doing so almost always introduces an unbounded risk in case this assumption does not bear out in practice. At the other, fully key-aware end of the spectrum, Perfect Hashing algorithms can discover hash functions to bucket a given set of keys optimally, but they are costly to run and require the keys to be known and fixed ahead of time. Our main conceptual contribution is that adapting the hash table's hash function to the keys online is necessary for the best performance, as adaptivity allows for better bucketing of keys \\emph{and} faster hash functions. We instantiate the idea of online adaptation with minimal overhead and no change to the hash table API.

However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

While generative recommender systems have emerged as a transformative paradigm, they face hurdles in effectively modeling extensive historical sequences. To address this challenge, we propose GLASS, a novel framework that integrates long-term user interests into the generative process via SID-Tier and Semantic Search. We first introduce SID-Tier, a module that maps long-term interactions into a unified interest vector to enhance the prediction of the initial SID token. Unlike traditional retrieval models that struggle with massive item spaces, SID-Tier leverages the compact nature of the semantic codebook to incorporate cross features between the user's long-term history and candidate semantic codes. Furthermore, we present semantic hard search, which utilizes generated coarse-grained semantic ID as dynamic keys to extract relevant historical behaviors, which are then fused via an adaptive gated fusion module to recalibrate the trajectory of subsequent fine-grained tokens. To address the inherent data sparsity in semantic hard search, we propose two strategies: semantic neighbor augmentation and codebook resizing. Extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets, TAOBAO-MM and KuaiRec, demonstrate that GLASS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant gains in recommendation quality. Our codes are made publicly available to facilitate further research in generative recommendation."}

Semantic representation strategies represent a move towards richer associative connections that can adequately capture this complex usage of language. Vector Space Modelling (VSM) and neural word embeddings play a crucial role in modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Embeddings use distributional semantics to represent words, sentences, paragraphs or entire documents as vectors in high dimensional spaces. This can be leveraged by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to exploit the semantic relatedness between queries and answers.\n  This paper evaluates an alternative approach to measuring query statement similarity that moves away from the common similarity measure of centroids of neural word embeddings. Motivated by the Word Movers Distance (WMD) model, similarity is evaluated using the distance between individual words of queries and statements. Results from ranked query and response statements demonstrate significant gains in accuracy using the combined approach of similarity ranking through WMD with the word embedding techniques. The top performing WMD + GloVe combination outperforms all other state-of-the-art retrieval models including Doc2Vec and the baseline LSA model. Along with the significant gains in performance of similarity ranking through WMD, we conclude that the use of pre-trained word embeddings, trained on vast amounts of data, result in domain agnostic language processing solutions that are portable to diverse business use-cases."}

However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \\modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \\modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings."}

In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation."}

Meanwhile, LLM-based retrievers have demonstrated strong capability in following instructions or reasoning. This raises a critical question: can LLM-based retrievers effectively contribute to deep research agent workflows? To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus.We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers. This yields 8% and 2% gains on short-form and open-ended questions, respectively."}

We prove a tight Omega(N) space lower bound (cell-probe model) and present a trie-based index using O(N*L) space with O(L+k) query time. We contrast this with pairwise materialization (Theta(N^2)), which hits a practical OOM wall at scale, while our indexed approach remains O(N) in memory. We then introduce Thermal-Aware Logic (TAL), which turns prefix structure into range-bounded scans. In hardware measurements, TAL reduces energy per query by 308x (0.0145 J vs 4.46 J) and cuts p95 latency by 329x (0.114 ms vs 37.5 ms) on a 20M-item range-scan benchmark, while sustaining near-peak utilization (~99%) under long runs. The result is a deterministic retrieval primitive with receipts in regimes where approximate methods are unacceptable."}
