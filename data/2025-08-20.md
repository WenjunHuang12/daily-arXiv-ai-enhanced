### [1] [Fair Division Among Couples and Small Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13432)
*Paul Gölz,Hannane Yaghoubizade*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了不可分割物品在小组间的公平分配问题，特别关注两人小组（夫妻）和其他小型群体。对于两个夫妻组，EF1分配总是存在且可高效找到；对于三个或更多夫妻组，EF1分配可能不存在。对于最多k人的小组，PROPk分配总是存在且可高效计算，算法还能保证帕累托最优性和按顺序的PROP1、PROP2等性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小组形式的公平分配问题，特别是夫妻等小型群体的物品分配场景，探索在不同群体规模下公平分配方案的存在性和可计算性。

Method: 采用理论分析和算法设计的方法，针对不同群体规模（特别是两人组和k人组）设计公平分配算法，证明EF1和PROPk等公平概念的存在性和计算复杂性。

Result: 对于两个夫妻组，EF1分配总是存在且可高效计算；对于三个以上夫妻组，EF1分配可能不存在。对于最多k人的小组，PROPk分配总是存在且可高效找到，算法还能保证帕累托最优性和顺序性的PROP性质。

Conclusion: 小组规模的公平分配问题具有不同的复杂性特征，两人组有较好的EF1保证，而更大规模组需要采用PROPk等弱化条件，但总能找到高效的公平分配方案。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods across groups of agents,
where each agent fully enjoys all goods allocated to their group. We focus on
groups of two (couples) and other groups of small size. For two couples, an EF1
allocation -- one in which all agents find their group's bundle no worse than
the other group's, up to one good -- always exists and can be found
efficiently. For three or more couples, EF1 allocations need not exist.
  Turning to proportionality, we show that, whenever groups have size at most
$k$, a PROP$k$ allocation exists and can be found efficiently. In fact, our
algorithm additionally guarantees (fractional) Pareto optimality, and PROP1 to
the first agent in each group, PROP2 to the second, etc., for an arbitrary
agent ordering. In special cases, we show that there are PROP1 allocations for
any number of couples.

### [2] [Reactive Users vs. Recommendation Systems: An Adaptive Policy to Manage Opinion Drifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13473)
*Atefeh Mollabagher,Parinaz Naghizadeh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究用户在面对推荐系统时的反应策略，分析被动固定点击策略和自适应反应策略对用户观点漂移和效用的影响，发现自适应策略能更好地保护用户观点并提高效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通过个性化和热门内容推送最大化用户参与度，但可能逐渐塑造用户观点。研究用户是否可以通过自适应调整内容消费选择来防止这种观点变化。

Method: 研究两种随机策略下的用户观点动态：被动固定点击概率策略和自适应反应策略（观点漂移大时点击概率自适应降低）。通过理论推导期望观点和用户效用，并用数值模拟验证。

Result: 自适应策略能帮助用户防止观点漂移，当用户优先考虑观点保持时，自适应策略的期望效用优于固定策略。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于更好理解用户层面策略如何挑战推荐系统引发的偏见，用户可以通过自适应反应策略来对抗推荐系统的影响。

Abstract: Recommendation systems are used in a range of platforms to maximize user
engagement through personalization and the promotion of popular content. It has
been found that such recommendations may shape users' opinions over time. In
this paper, we ask whether reactive users, who are cognizant of the influence
of the content they consume, can prevent such changes by adaptively adjusting
their content consumption choices. To this end, we study users' opinion
dynamics under two types of stochastic policies: a passive policy where the
probability of clicking on recommended content is fixed and a reactive policy
where clicking probability adaptively decreases following large opinion drifts.
We analytically derive the expected opinion and user utility under these
policies. We show that the adaptive policy can help users prevent opinion
drifts and that when a user prioritizes opinion preservation, the expected
utility of the adaptive policy outperforms the fixed policy. We validate our
theoretical findings through numerical simulations. These findings help better
understand how user-level strategies can challenge the biases induced by
recommendation systems.

### [3] [Optimal Candidate Positioning in Multi-Issue Elections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13841)
*Colin Cleveland,Bart de Keijzer,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 多维空间投票选举中候选人最优位置计算是NP难问题，但对常数维度有高效算法，并扩展到位置评分规则


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多维空间投票模型中候选人如何战略性地选择最优位置来最大化选票，为竞选策略提供算法工具

Method: 使用几何方法，包括超平面枚举算法(O(n^{d+1}))和径向扫描算法(O(n log n) for d=2)，并扩展到k-approval和Borda等位置评分规则

Result: 证明了对单个对手计算最优位置是NP难问题，但对常数维度问题可解；提出了精确算法和近似保证

Conclusion: 阐明了多维空间选举的算法格局，为竞选策略提供了实际可实现的工具，几何方法可无缝扩展到各种投票规则

Abstract: We study strategic candidate positioning in multidimensional spatial-voting
elections. Voters and candidates are represented as points in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
and each voter supports the candidate that is closest under a distance induced
by an $\ell_p$-norm. We prove that computing an optimal location for a new
candidate is NP-hard already against a single opponent, whereas for a constant
number of issues the problem is tractable: an $O(n^{d+1})$
hyperplane-enumeration algorithm and an $O(n \log n)$ radial-sweep routine for
$d=2$ solve the task exactly. We further derive the first approximation
guarantees for the general multi-candidate case and show how our geometric
approach extends seamlessly to positional-scoring rules such as $k$-approval
and Borda. These results clarify the algorithmic landscape of multidimensional
spatial elections and provide practically implementable tools for campaign
strategy.

### [4] [Control by Deleting Players from Weighted Voting Games Is NP^PP-Complete for the Penrose-Banzhaf Power Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13868)
*Joanna Kaczmarek,Jörg Rothe*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了加权投票游戏中通过删除玩家来控制玩家权力的计算复杂性，证明了当使用Penrose-Banzhaf指数衡量权力时，某些控制问题是NP^PP完全的


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加权投票游戏广泛应用于现实决策场景，如议会立法和企业投票。虽然通过添加玩家来控制游戏复杂性的问题已经解决，但通过删除玩家来控制的问题仍未解决，需要深入研究

Method: 使用计算复杂性理论分析，特别是NP^PP完全性证明技术，研究在Penrose-Banzhaf指数下通过删除玩家来控制加权投票游戏的计算复杂度

Result: 证明了当使用概率Penrose-Banzhaf指数时，通过删除玩家来控制加权投票游戏的一些问题是NP^PP完全的，这显著改进了现有的较低复杂度类硬度下界

Conclusion: 研究结果为实际应用提供了针对SAT求解技术的保护，表明这些控制问题在计算上非常困难，最优地提升了现有复杂度下界

Abstract: Weighted voting games are a popular class of coalitional games that are
widely used to model real-life situations of decision-making. They can be
applied, for instance, to analyze legislative processes in parliaments or
voting in corporate structures. Various ways of tampering with these games have
been studied, among them merging or splitting players, fiddling with the quota,
and controlling weighted voting games by adding or deleting players. While the
complexity of control by adding players to such games so as to change or
maintain a given player's power has been recently settled, the complexity of
control by deleting players from such games (with the same goals) remained
open. We show that when the players' power is measured by the probabilistic
Penrose-Banzhaf index, some of these problems are complete for NP^PP -- the
class of problems solvable by NP machines equipped with a PP ("probabilistic
polynomial time") oracle. Our results optimally improve the currently known
lower bounds of hardness for much smaller complexity classes, thus providing
protection against SAT-solving techniques in practical applications.

### [5] [A Mechanism for Mutual Fairness in Cooperative Games with Replicable Resources -- Extended Version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13960)
*Björn Filter,Ralf Möller,Özgür Lütfü Özçep*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对可复制资源（如数据和模型）的协作学习系统中公平分配奖励的新机制，通过平衡互惠公理确保参与者之间的相互公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体系统中协作学习面临公平奖励分配的挑战，传统合作博弈论（如Shapley值）假设资源不可复制，无法处理数据和模型的可复制性特性

Method: 提出新的公平性公理和机制设计，特别是平衡互惠公理，确保每对参与者从对方参与中获得同等收益

Result: 开发了一个新机制并证明其满足相互公平性属性，解决了参与者之间互惠利益不平衡导致的战略利用和不公平分配问题

Conclusion: 为可复制资源场景提供了广义的公平性概念和实现机制，解决了协作学习中公平奖励分配的核心挑战

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and
human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative
learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual
agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and
alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon
achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions
of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each
coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation
can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete
mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley
value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it
assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.
Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized
through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal
benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and
unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a
proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the
Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each
benefits equally from the participation of the other.

### [6] [BERT-VQA: Visual Question Answering on Plots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13184)
*Tai Vu,Robert Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BERT-VQA模型在图表视觉问答任务中表现不如预期，跨模态模块并非关键因素，为图表问答挑战提供了重要架构洞见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解中的挑战性子任务，需要模型同时处理视觉和语言信息

Method: 开发基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型，使用预训练ResNet 101图像编码器，可能加入联合融合模块，与包含LSTM、CNN和浅层分类器的基线模型对比

Result: 最终结果推翻了核心假设，证明VisualBERT中的跨模态模块对于对齐图表组件和问题短语并非必需

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图表问答任务的难度，并为解决该问题的合适模型架构选择提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

TL;DR: 基于CNN和LLM的多模态情感分析方法，通过上下文注意力机制融合文本和图像信息，在灾难管理场景中实现了更高的准确度和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾难期间，通过社交媒体多模态内容理解公众情感对危机管理至关重要，但传统方法分离处理文本和图像模态的效果有限。

Method: 结合CNN图像分析和LLM文本处理，使用GPT和prompt工程提取情感特征，通过上下文注意力机制模型模态间关系，并使用深度神经网络学习融合后的特征。

Result: 模型在CrisisMMD数据集上进行信息类别分类，精确度提升2.43%，F1分数提升5.18%，显著提升了处理复杂多模态数据的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅在数量指标上显示优势，还能提供更深入的情感见解，为AI驱动的灾难管理解决方案开启了有前景的方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

### [8] [Strategies for training point distributions in physics-informed neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13216)
*Santosh Humagain,Toni Schneidereit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了物理信息神经网络(PINNs)中训练点分布对求解微分方程精度的影响，比较了五种训练数据生成策略，包括新提出的基于正弦函数的分布方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 使用两个常微分方程和两个偏微分方程，测试五种训练数据生成策略（包括新提出的基于正弦函数的分布），采用浅层网络架构（1-2个隐藏层），并通过随机和固定种子权重初始化确保结果可复现性。

Result: 研究结果显示训练点分布对解精度有显著影响，且这种影响与微分方程的特性相关。基于正弦函数的训练点分布表现出良好性能。

Conclusion: 训练点分布是影响PINNs性能的关键因素，需要根据具体微分方程特性进行针对性选择，基于正弦函数的分布策略具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

*Su Chen,Xiaohua Qi,Xixun Lin,Yanmin Shang,Xiaolin Xu,Yangxi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DGNPP模型，结合图神经网络和点过程，同时捕捉时间交互网络的拓扑结构和动态时序特征，显著提升事件和时间预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间交互网络学习忽略了网络拓扑结构的影响，将其视为粗粒度的多序列预测问题，存在局限性

Method: DGNPP包含节点聚合层（捕捉拓扑结构生成静态表示）和自注意力层（动态更新嵌入），将动态和静态嵌入结合到事件强度函数中，通过最大似然估计优化

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，DGNPP在事件预测和时间预测任务中均取得优越性能，高效且显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: DGNPP有效解决了先前方法的局限性，通过结合拓扑结构和时序动态性，为时间交互网络学习提供了更全面的解决方案

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

*Mizuki Ohira,Toshimichi Saito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于递归神经网络的S-P图聚类方法，通过网络动力学特性将大规模教育数据分解为小型S-P图聚类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学生数量增加，S-P图处理变得困难，需要将大规模图表分解为小型聚类以简化处理

Method: 使用具有多个固定点和吸引域的递归神经网络，通过网络动力学特性实现对S-P图的聚类分解

Result: 通过基础实验验证了方法的有效性，并提出了平均警戒指数作为评估聚类性能的关键特征量

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地对大规模S-P图进行聚类处理，为教育数据分析提供了一种简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: This paper studies an application of a recurrent neural network to clustering
method for the S-P chart: a binary data set used widely in education. As the
number of students increases, the S-P chart becomes hard to handle. In order to
classify the large chart into smaller charts, we present a simple clustering
method based on the network dynamics. In the method, the network has multiple
fixed points and basins of attraction give clusters corresponding to small S-P
charts. In order to evaluate the clustering performance, we present an
important feature quantity: average caution index that characterizes
singularity of students answer oatterns. Performing fundamental experiments,
effectiveness of the method is confirmed.

### [11] [Order Optimal Regret Bounds for Sharpe Ratio Optimization in the Bandit Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13749)
*Mohammad Taha Shah,Sabrina Khurshid,Gourab Ghatak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究在斯托克随机腕环境下通过求解复杂的信息获取问题来实现复杂的信息获取问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统腕环算法主要关注积累奖励最大化，而复杂的信息获取问题需要同时考虑收益和风险控制，导致了新的挑战

Method: 提出了一种新的夸普比率后悔分解方法，并设计了基于桑普森采样的SRTS算法，在高斯奖励偏差未知的假设下进行风险调整性能优化

Result: 理论分析证明算法达到了对数后悔增长，并得到了匹配的下界，显示其订单优化性质。实验结果表明该算法显著超过现有算法

Conclusion: 桑普森采样在夸普比率最大化问题中表现出艾尼敏的探索效率，通过新的后悔分析框架揭示了奖励分布信息获取在风险调整性能学习中的关键作用

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

### [12] [RISE: Enhancing VLM Image Annotation with Self-Supervised Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13229)
*Suhang Hu,Wei Hu,Yuhang Su,Fan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链，然后利用高质量思维链进行监督微调和强化微调，提升视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中的推理能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务（如情感分类和上下文驱动的目标检测）中表现不佳，标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链而产生不一致的推理。

Method: RISE框架包含两个阶段：1) Reason阶段（RISE-CoT）：使用强化学习的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链，通过验证其重构原始标注的能力而不直接泄露信息；2) Inspire和Strengthen阶段（RISE-R1）：利用RISE-CoT奖励筛选的高质量思维链子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调以产生可解释的推理和准确的标注。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上的评估显示，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型优于标准监督微调和视觉强化微调方法，实现了鲁棒的性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一个自监督解决方案，无需手动标注的思维链即可推进视觉语言模型的推理能力，在复杂视觉任务中实现了专业级的性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

*Sergey Salishev,Ian Akhremchik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种量化神经网络的新方法，将量化过程模型化为噪声通道链，通过学习位宽、噪声缩放和限定边界来达到极端低位宽量化的竞争性准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络通常被视为一系列噪声通道，四舍操作会随着位宽减小而降低通道容量。研究者想要理解量化瓶颈并在极端低位宽设置下保持高准确度。

Method: 使用全微分直通估计器(STE)，具有可学习的位宽、噪声缩放和限定边界。通过外点罚法强制目标位宽，并使用软化评估指标（通过知识精炼）来稳定训练。

Result: 该方法在极端的W1A1（正数都是1位）设置下仍能达到竞争性的准确度，同时保持了STE的高效率。

Conclusion: 虽然方法简单，但能够有效地解决极端低位宽量化的挑战，为高效量化神经网络提供了一种简洁而强大的方案。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

Result: 提出了一种结合堆叠回归算法和相对阶条件的新方法，能够发现并反馈线性化物理模型的真实经典方程

Conclusion: 该方法为物理系统的动态识别和控制器设计提供了一种有效的新途径，适用于处理复杂的非线性系统问题

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种协作匹配系统(comatch)，通过算法自动选择最有信心的决策来做，并将其余决策延迟给人类，从而实现人工智能互补效果，在大规模人类实验中表现超过单独使用人类或算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据驱动匹配系统无法实现人工智能互补，人类使用算法系统做出的决策并不一定比人类或算法单独做出的更好。需要一种新的协作方式来充分利用人工智能和人类决策者的优势。

Method: 提出协作匹配(comatch)系统，系统不做所有匹配决策，而是选择自己最有信心的决策来做，将其余决策延迟给人类决策者。系统优化自己做决策的数量和延迟给人类的数量，以证明方式最大化性能。

Result: 通过800名参与者的大规模人类实验验证，协作匹配系统产生的匹配结果表现超过了人类参与者单独或算法匹配单独的性能。

Conclusion: 协作匹配系统能够有效实现人工智能互补，在高风险应用领域中提高决策质量，为医疗健康和社会服务等领域的匹配问题提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了层次化共形分类(HCC)，将类别层次结构融入共形预测框架，在保持覆盖保证的同时生成包含不同层次节点的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准共形预测将类别视为平面结构，忽略了类别标签之间的语义关系或层次结构等域知识。

Method: 将HCC建模为约束优化问题，通过证明一个更小、结构良好的候选解子集足以确保覆盖并保持最优性来解决组合复杂性。

Result: 在音频、图像和文本数据三个新基准上的实证评估显示方法的优势，用户研究表明标注者显著偏好层次化预测集而非平面预测集。

Conclusion: HCC成功将类别层次结构整合到共形预测中，在保持统计保证的同时提供更具信息性和用户友好的预测集。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

*Zhengyan Huan,Jacob Boerma,Li-Ping Liu,Shuchin Aeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种约束条件下的流匹配生成方法：一种使用可微距离函数，另一种通过成员查询oracle，通过惩罚项和随机化策略实现约束满足，在保持目标分布的同时显著提高约束满足率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成方法缺乏对约束条件的有效处理，特别是在只有成员查询oracle的情况下，需要开发新的方法来生成满足复杂约束的样本。

Method: 针对可微距离函数情况，在FM目标中加入约束惩罚项；针对oracle查询情况，采用随机化学习均值流的方法，并提出两阶段计算高效策略。

Result: 数值实验显示，所提方法在多个合成约束生成任务中显著提高了约束满足率，同时保持了目标分布匹配性能，并成功应用于对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: 该方法为约束流匹配生成提供了有效解决方案，特别是在oracle约束场景下表现出色，为未来研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语言习得研究假设学习者能够观察到所有相关信息，但现实中存在部分可观测性的挑战，需要从环境、行动和消息中推断缺失信息

Method: 提出了一个学习型算法，通过环境知识、采取的行动和发送的消息来解码私有信息，从而促进语言习得

Result: 在玩具设置中展示了该问题可以被解决，并正式探讨了在更一般设置中出现的挑战

Conclusion: 部分可观测性条件下的语言习得是一个更具挑战性但更现实的问题，需要开发新的算法来从有限信息中推断语言映射

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

TL;DR: 通过动态图结构和空间时间注意力机制提出了一种新的fMRI分析框架，在孩童孤独症诊断中显著提升了精度和AUC指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的fMRI分析方法主要基于静态功能连通性，无法全面捐捕空间时间关系，需要更好地理解神经活动动态

Method: 使用变换器注意力机制动态推断脑功能连通性，构建时变图并结合图卷积网络和变换器处理，实现局部交互和全局时间依赖性的捐捕

Result: 在ABIDE数据集子集上达到了63.2%的准确率和60.0的AUC，显著超过静态图方法（GCN:51.8%）

Conclusion: 动态连通性与空间时间上下文联合建模在fMRI分类中具有显著效果，关键创新在于注意力驱动的动态图创建和层次空间时间特征融合

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构存在激活内存开销大、通信成本高的问题，且当前训练系统主要针对NVIDIA GPU优化，在非NVIDIA平台上性能不佳，未能充分利用计算潜力

Method: 采用padding-free MoE训练、跨平台内核、冗余绕过调度、序列分片MoE块的混合并行等技术

Result: 在Frontier超级计算机（AMD MI250X GPU）上成功扩展到5450亿参数，比现有方法在相同硬件预算下可训练的最大模型大10倍，同时保持高训练吞吐量

Conclusion: X-MoE系统有效解决了MoE训练的可扩展性问题，为非NVIDIA平台上的大规模MoE模型训练提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

Motivation: 未来轨迹预测在自动驾驶、飓风预报和流行病建模等领域很重要，但现有的采样轨迹通常未经校准，缺乏可靠的不确定性估计

Method: 引入新颖的在线更新步骤和优化步骤来捕捉步间依赖关系，生成围绕每条轨迹的不连续预测区间

Result: 能够自然捕捉时间依赖性，产生更尖锐、更自适应的不确定性估计

Conclusion: 该框架为轨迹预测提供了理论覆盖保证的校准方法，显著改进了不确定性量化

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: J3O框架有效解决了多任务边缘推理的联合优化问题，在保证高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于资源受限的边缘设备环境。

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

Motivation: 为了开发一种可靠的方法来准确定位疯痪起源区域，以支持疯痪外科手术的决策，特别是在传统方法遇到挑战的情况下。

Method: 采用两步方法：(1)无监督异常检测，使用局部异常因子(LOF)分析识别异常通道；(2)空间相关性分析，计算精确匹配指标和加权指数相似性。

Result: 结果显示LOF方法(N邻居=20，污染率=0.2)有效检测异常通道。成功手术患者的指标精度平均为0.865，失败案例为0.460。加权空间指标比精确匹配效果更好。

Conclusion: 鸽鹂事件基于的异常检测结合加权空间指标，为疯痪起源区域定位提供了补充方法，特别在手术成功的患者中效果显著。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Motivation: 传统上下文戳手假设数据要么完全集中要么完全隔离，在网络环境中部分信息共享的情况下研究较少

Method: 提出NetLinUCB和Net-SGD-UCB两种网络感知的UCB算法，通过动态更新网络权重实现适应性信息共享，将学习分解为全局和本地组件

Result: 算法通信成本较低，只共享同质特征的计算摘要；悟悚界限显示学习复杂度从O(N)降低到次线性O(√N)，其中N为网络规模

Conclusion: 两种算法具有互补优势：NetLinUCB在低噪声和细粒度异质性情况下表现优异，Net-SGD-UCB在高维高方差上下文中更加稳健，在模拟定价环境中表现超过标准基准方法

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: MAVIS是一个轻量级的推理时对齐框架，通过价值引导的搜索实现多目标LLM对齐，无需修改基础模型权重，在多个目标间实现动态平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每个目标或偏好配置微调模型，计算成本高且不灵活，需要一种轻量级的多目标对齐方案。

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户指定权重组合这些模型产生倾斜函数，调整基础模型的输出分布。

Result: MAVIS在性能上优于为每个目标微调模型并事后组合的基线方法，接近为特定用户偏好微调的理想化设置性能。

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一种计算高效且灵活的多目标LLM对齐方法，能够在推理时动态控制模型行为，实现用户指定的目标权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，EventTSF在12个基线方法中表现最优，预测准确率提升10.7%，训练效率提高1.13倍。

Conclusion: EventTSF成功解决了多模态时间序列预测中的关键挑战，通过创新的扩散变换器架构实现了时间和文本模态的有效融合，为事件感知的非平稳时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer是一个结合SVD和Transformer的新框架，用于有向图的表示学习，通过多头自注意力机制增强关键频谱成分并抑制高频噪声，在节点分类任务上优于现有方法


<details>

Motivation: 现有的有向图神经网络由于各向同性聚合机制和局部滤波机制，难以同时捕捉方向语义和全局结构模式

Method: 使用SVD分解，通过Transformer的多头自注意力机制精化奇异值嵌入，将奇异向量作为方向投影基，奇异值作为缩放因子，通过注意力权重建模入边/出边模式的多尺度交互

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图上的表示学习建立了新范式，能够显式地保持特征传播过程中的边方向性

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Method: 使用历史元知识来选择有前景的搜索空间区域，动态设计AutoML的搜索空间。

Result: 方法能够在Random Search中减少89%的运行时间，并大幅缩减搜索空间（预处理器从13个减到1.8个，分类器从16个减到4.3个），且不影响预测性能。在Auto-Sklearn中也表现竞争力。

Conclusion: 该元学习方法能够有效加速AutoML优化过程，同时保持性能。研究还揭示了元特征选择、元模型可解释性以及搜索空间缩减策略的权衡。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

TL;DR: ASAP是一种无需标签的自适应学习率调整方法，通过计算当前和先前未标注输出的余弦距离来动态调整学习率，有效应对在线标签偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中机器学习模型面临在线标签偏移问题，标签分布随时间变化。传统方法需要谨慎选择学习率：过低会减慢适应速度，过高会导致不稳定。

Method: 提出ASAP方法，通过计算当前和先前未标注输出的余弦距离，并将其映射到有界范围内来动态调整学习率。该方法无需标签、模型集成或历史输入，仅使用先前的softmax输出进行快速轻量级适应。

Result: 在多个数据集和偏移场景的实验表明，ASAP始终能提高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: ASAP为无监督模型适应提供了一种实用有效的解决方案，能够快速适应在线标签分布变化。

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Conclusion: HCAL分类器在层次多标签分类中有效解决了结构一致性和优化偏差问题，表现出优越性能

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

Conclusion: DyMixOp框架成功解决了PDE动力学建模的关键挑战，通过理论驱动的变换和架构设计，在性能和物理可解释性方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

Conclusion: 算法不透明性是人工智能道德发展的主要阻碍之一，需要通过技术和制度方面的多元措施来应对。

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电网中渗透率增加，需要建筑群提供协调的需求灵活性。现有测试平台大多针对单栋建筑，多建筑平台有限且通常依赖简化模型，无法充分捕捉物理细节和中间变量，限制了作为基准测试工具的适用性。

Method: 开发了MuFlex平台，支持EnergyPlus建筑模型间的同步信息交换，遵循最新OpenAI Gym接口，提供模块化、标准化的强化学习实现。使用Soft Actor-Critic算法对四栋办公楼进行需求灵活性协调案例研究。

Result: 聚合四栋建筑的灵活性将总峰值需求降低到指定阈值以下，同时保持了室内环境质量。

Conclusion: MuFlex平台为多建筑灵活性协调控制策略提供了有效的基准测试工具，证明了建筑群协调控制在降低峰值需求和维持环境质量方面的可行性。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Motivation: MRSA是医院和长期护理机构的严重公共健康威胁，现有预测模型缺乏流行病学解释性且性能有限，机制模型难以校准且无法有效整合多种数据集

Method: 提出CALYPSO混合框架，结合神经网络和机制性超群体模型，利用患者保险申请、通勤数据和医疗转运模式学习区域和时间特异的MRSA传播参数

Result: CALYPSO在全省范围预测性能比机器学习基线提高4.5%以上，能够在县、医疗机构、区域、州等多空间分辨率下做准确预测，识别高风险区域和成本效益最优的感染防控资源分配策略

Conclusion: CALYPSO框架提供了一种既准确又可解释的MRSA传播预测方法，支持感染控制政策的反事实分析，为公共卫生决策提供了重要工具

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基因风险预测模型主要基于常见变异，预测准确性不足以满足临床需求，需要综合考虑常见和稀有变异来提高预测性能

Method: 提出了折叠受调者工作特征方法（CROC），是之前前向ROC方法（FROC）的扩展，特别加入了处理稀有变异的流程

Result: 使用533个SNPs和37个候选基因进行评估，发现综合所有SNPs的模型（AUC=0.605）比仅使用常见变异的模型（AUC=0.585）更准确。当常见变异数量减少时，CROC方法表现更优，在只有稀有变异的情况下，CROC的AUC为0.603，而FROC仅为0.524

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效地综合利用常见和稀有变异信息，显著提高疾病风险预测的准确性，尤其在稀有变异占主导的情况下优势更为明显

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法(BYOL、Barlow Twins、SwAV等)虽然在下游任务中表现出色，但缺乏统一的理论框架。本文旨在建立一个通用框架来分析这些方法，并提出改进策略。

Method: 提出了GLF框架，包含对齐部分和约束部分。分析了三种现有SSCL方法在GLF下的统一形式。提出了ADC方法，通过迭代捕获样本间动态关系来实现类内紧凑性和类间可分离性。

Result: 理论分析和实验评估都证明了ADC方法的优越性，能够有效提升特征空间对输入类别信息的保持能力。

Conclusion: GLF框架为理解自监督对比学习提供了统一视角，ADC方法通过动态关系建模有效解决了无标签情况下的类内紧凑性和类间可分离性问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic

Conclusion: 该研究通过系统比较和统一多种部分识别方法，显著提升了因果推断中部分识别技术的实用性和可及性，为实践者提供了有效的工具和指导。

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

TL;DR: FedOL是一个联邦学习框架，通过知识蒸馏在单轮通信中构建更强大的服务器模型，使用未标记公共数据集交换预测输出而非模型参数，解决了异构架构和通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习需要统一模型架构和多轮通信，忽视了资源异构性，给客户端带来沉重计算负担并增加通信开销。移动网络中客户端拥有宝贵私有数据但计算资源有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，客户端在未标记公共数据集上交换预测输出而非模型参数；引入专门的目标函数迭代优化伪标签和服务器模型；设计定制化的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略整合多样化知识。

Result: 仿真结果表明FedOL显著优于现有基线方法，为移动网络提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信和知识蒸馏有效解决了联邦学习中的异构架构、通信开销和隐私保护问题，特别适合计算资源有限的移动客户端场景。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 通过利用随机梯度的本质特征可以实现一种简单、无需手动调参的学习率自动调整方法，为深度学习训练提供了更加高效的解决方案

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Motivation: 现代神经网络在大型数据集上训练的计算和环境成本很高，需要开发更高效的训练方法来减少资源消耗和环境影响。

Method: 1) 为每个批次提取低秩特征表示；2) 应用Fast MaxVol采样器选择覆盖批次主导子空间的小型多样化子集；3) 使用梯度近似准则动态调整子集大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GRAFT在准确性和效率方面匹配或超越了最近的选择基线，在准确性、效率和排放之间提供了有利的权衡。

Conclusion: GRAFT通过在低秩子空间中操作并训练精心选择的样本而非完整批次，能够保持训练轨迹的同时显著减少训练时间、能耗和二氧化碳排放。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要靠数据和训练扩展以及推理时扩展，本文提出输入时间扩展来补充现有方法。

Method: 在训练和测试阶段都使用元知识精炼输入策略，发现训练-测试协同设计的新现象。讨论了在输入中添加无关信息和随机选择示例的效果。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型上达到了32B模型在AIME24(76.7%) 和 AIME25(76.7%) 的独立执行状态结果，多模型投票可达AIME24(76.7%) 和 AIME25(80%)。从DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B开始，最佳结果为AIME24(86.7%) 和 AIME25(76.7%)。

Conclusion: 输入时间扩展是一种有效的新范式，能够反转传统偏见，在少量数据上实现高性能。这些发现与"少即是多"现象相符，并将开源相关资源以便进一步研究。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Conclusion: 该工作成功扩展了CASH框架以适应现代ML流水线，PS-PFN方法为处理异构ML流水线选择问题提供了有效的解决方案，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

Conclusion: 该框架为对抗性重尾bandit问题提供了有效的解决方案，首次实现了重尾线性bandit的BOBW性能，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

Motivation: 现有降维方法要么专注于保持局部结构（如t-SNE、UMAP），要么专注于保持全局结构（如MDS、PCA），但没有方法能够同时很好地保持这两个方面的结构。

Method: 通过简单的正则化项将t-SNE的局部结构保持能力与PCA的全局结构保持能力相结合，生成从局部结构良好的t-SNE嵌入到全局结构良好的PCA嵌入之间的连续谱嵌入。

Result: 在7个真实世界数据集（包括5个单细胞转录组数据集和1个群体遗传学数据集）上进行基准测试，定性和定量结果都显示DREAMS在保持多尺度结构方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法能够有效平衡局部和全局结构的保持，在多个尺度上展现出优越的结构保持能力，为高维数据可视化提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

*Tian Sun,Yuqi Chen,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种简单但高效的周期嵌套组注意力机制PENGUIN，用于长期时间序列预测，显著超越了传统的MLP和Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型在预测任务中取得了重要突破，但其在时间序列预测中的有效性仍有争议。需要重新考虑自注意力机制的意义，并明确建模周期模式的重要性。

Method: 提出周期嵌套相对注意偏置，直接捐捕周期结构；设计分组注意力机制，每个组使用多查询注意力机制专门处理特定周期性（如每日、每周周期）。

Result: 在多个巨大的基准测试中，PENGUIN模型一贯地在性能上超过了基于MLP和Transformer的各种模型。

Conclusion: 显式建模周期模式和结合相对注意偏置对时间序列建模至关重要，PENGUIN方法提供了一种简单但高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为ISP的自适应机制，动态确定每轮训练中最优的客户端数量，在保持模型准确性的同时实现了达30%的通信效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型的快速扩展，通信效率成为联邦学习中的关键瓶颈，尤其是在异构和动态客户端参与的情况下。尽管存在方法如FedAvg和FedProx等尝试缓解这些问题，但选择每轮客户端数量的问题仍然很少被深入研究。

Method: 提出了智能参与者选择(ISP)机制，通过动态确定每轮训练中的最优客户端数量来提升通信效率。该方法在多种设置下进行了验证，包括视觉Transformer、真实世界ECG分类以及梯度压缩训练。

Result: 结果显示，ISP能够一致地节省达30%的通信开销，而不会影响最终模型质量。在不同的真实世界ECG分类设置中应用ISP，证明了选择客户端数量是联邦学习中一个独立的重要任务。

Conclusion: ISP机制有效地解决了联邦学习中的通信效率瓶颈问题，通过动态选择最优客户端数量，在保持模型性能的同时实现了显著的通信节省。这为联邦学习的通信效率优化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Conclusion: 研究给实践者提供了重要的见解，应根据具体目标和约束条件选择适合的剪析策略，混合方法为剪析领域带来了新的可能性

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP是一种轻量级的联邦遗忘算法，通过剪枝特定连接来高效消除恶意客户端对全局模型的影响，仅需最后一轮训练权重即可实现，在保持良性数据性能的同时有效降低恶意数据准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中恶意客户端可能进行模型投毒攻击，而传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信合作，在恶意客户端可能共谋的情况下难以应用，需要开发能够在不依赖恶意客户端合作的情况下有效消除其影响的解决方案。

Method: FedUP通过分析良性客户端和恶意客户端在最后一轮训练中的权重更新差异，选择并清零那些差异最大的高幅度权重，从而剪除恶意影响同时保留良性信息。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据、标签翻转和后门攻击等多种场景下，FedUP都能有效降低恶意影响，将恶意数据准确率降至与从头训练模型相当的水平，同时保持良性数据性能，且比现有最优方案更快、更节省存储。

Conclusion: FedUP提供了一种高效、鲁棒的联邦遗忘解决方案，能够在恶意客户端可能共谋的强对抗环境下有效消除其影响，为联邦学习安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) 是一种新方法，通过利用两个子批次的梯度构建方差感知更新方向，在大批量训练中恢复二阶方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU支持大批量训练（数万个样本），但现有优化器在大批量下表现不佳。一阶方法梯度噪声减少，难以逃离局部极小值；二阶方法（如KFAC）需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势。

Method: FOP利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下构建与平均梯度正交的梯度差分量，增强平均梯度，形成方差感知更新方向。

Result: FOP在大批量训练中恢复了二阶方法的有效性，实现了可扩展训练，具有更好的泛化性能和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FOP技术成功解决了大批量训练中优化器性能下降的问题，使二阶方法在大批量下仍能保持其优势。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

Motivation: 散布式Q学习(DQL)在离线强化学习中表现突出，但因需要多步去噪过程而存在计算效率低的问题。简单的一步去噪方法会导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 提出One-Step Flow Q-Learning (OFQL)框架，将DQL重构在流匹配(FM)框架中。学习平均速度场来支持直接、准确的动作生成，避免传统FM的曲线生成路径。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，OFQL表现超过DQL和其他散布基准方法，同时大幅减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: OFQL通过流匹配框架实现了高效的一步动作生成，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了计算效率，为离线强化学习提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的深度强化学习策略通常使用高斯分布参数化，限制了学习到的行为是单模态的。然而许多实际决策问题需要多模态策略来促进环境探索，解决稀疏奖励、复杂动态或需要适应不同情境的学习挑战。

Method: 引入分类策略，使用中间分类分布建模多模态行为模式，然后基于采样的模式生成输出动作。探索了两种采样方案，确保可微分的离散潜在结构，同时保持高效的基于梯度的优化。

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite环境中评估，通过更好的探索，学习到的策略收敛更快且优于标准高斯策略。

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的强大工具。

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoScale是一个无需昂贵权重搜索的两阶段框架，利用多任务优化指标自动选择线性标量化权重，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能和高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然固定权重的线性标量化可以达到甚至优于复杂多任务优化方法的性能，但最佳权重的选择原因和确定方法仍不明确，需要避免耗尽的超参数搜索

Method: 建立线性标量化与多任务优化方法的直接联系，通过大量实验发现性能良好的标量化权重在关键MTO指标上表现出特定趋势（如高梯度幅度相似性），基于此开发AutoScale两阶段框架

Result: AutoScale在包括新的大规模基准测试在内的多样化数据集上始终表现出优越性能和高效率

Conclusion: 通过分析MTO指标与标量化权重性能的关系，可以开发出简单有效的自动权重选择方法，避免昂贵的搜索过程

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

*Jiho Park,Huiwen Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了多用户上下文级联赌博机模型(MCCB)，针对多用户同时与顺序展示项目交互的在线广告场景，设计了UCBBP和AUCBBP两种算法并证明了其遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上下文赌博机无法捕捉多用户同时交互、顺序展示项目和异质奖励的现实在线广告场景，需要新的组合赌博机框架。

Method: 提出了MCCB模型，包含级联反馈、并行上下文会话和异质臂级奖励三个关键结构元素。设计了UCBBP（基于置信上界的反向规划）和AUCBBP（主动置信上界反向规划）两种算法。

Result: UCBBP达到O~(√THN)遗憾界，AUCBBP在用户扩展方面效率更高，达到O~(√T+HN)遗憾界。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: MCCB框架有效建模了多用户在线交互场景，提出的算法在理论和实验上都表现出色，特别AUCBBP在用户规模扩展时具有显著效率优势。

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KMR框架是一个统一的深度学习模型效率技术表示和推理形式化方法，将剪枝、量化、知识蒸馏等技术抽象为可控旋钮、确定性规则和可测量仪表的三元组结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型效率优化方法多样且分散，缺乏统一的数学框架来系统化表示、组合和分析这些技术，阻碍了效率优化研究的进一步发展。

Method: 提出Knob-Meter-Rule框架，将各种效率技术抽象为旋钮（控制参数）、规则（确定性操作）和仪表（测量指标）的三元组表示，并开发Budgeted-KMR算法进行迭代预算优化。

Result: 成功将多种知名效率方法实例化为KMR三元组，提供了简洁的算法模板，揭示了方法间的内在联系，支持混合流水线构建。

Conclusion: KMR框架为模型效率研究提供了统一的概念和实践工具，为自动化策略学习、动态适应和成本质量权衡的理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible
policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the
Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer是一个基于Transformer的架构，结合混合专家池化分类器，用于从fMRI数据中识别自闭症谱系障碍的神经特征，在ABIDE数据集上实现了最先进的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）与大脑连接性异常相关，功能MRI能够捕捉大规模神经动态。有效识别ASD相关的连接模式异常对于改善诊断和生物标志物发现至关重要。

Method: 提出ASDFormer Transformer架构，集成混合池化-分类器专家（MoE）系统，通过注意力机制自适应强调与自闭症相关的大脑区域和连接模式。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上实现了最先进的诊断准确性，并揭示了与ASD相关的功能连接中断的稳健见解。

Conclusion: ASDFormer不仅提高了分类性能，还提供了更可解释的疾病相关生物标志物识别，展示了其作为生物标志物发现工具的潜力。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

TL;DR: 知识图谨学习新方法，通过泰勒展开和零阶优化接近反海森矩阵，高效移除训练数据影响，避免计算一阶二阶导数的高成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足"被忘记权"等法规要求，需要从模型中移除训练数据及其影响，但全量重新训练成本过高，而知识图的特殊结构和实体语义关系使得谨学习更加复杂

Method: 定义知识图谨学习的影响函数，使用泰勒展开估计数据移除导致的参数变化，利用Fisher矩阵和零阶优化接近反海森矩阵向量积，避免构建计算图

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在谨学习效率和谨学习质量方面显著超过其他最先进的图谨学习基准方法

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的知识图谨学习算法，通过数学接近方法大幅降低计算复杂度，为大规模知识图的数据移除需求提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于类型拓扑空间的新方法，用于分析二维数据集的内在结构，通过将数据组织成轨道和组件，并用整数序列和伪树结构表示，为凸包计算、聚类和异常检测等算法提供新平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据集研究主要依赖统计方法和代数拓扑方法，本文从一般拓扑学角度引入类型拓扑空间概念，旨在开发一种新的方法来研究有限拓扑空间（如数据集）的内在结构。

Method: 开发了一套特殊的类型集及其相关的类型拓扑结构，利用R^2的自然商空间将数据集组织成轨道，每个轨道分割为有序组件，并用整数序列表示。组件跨轨道形成分支，通过类型II伪树结构表示关系。

Result: 成功构建了能够揭示数据集内在结构的类型拓扑框架，将数据组织成有序的轨道和组件结构，形成了可用于算法设计的伪树表示。

Conclusion: 类型拓扑方法为数据集分析提供了新的拓扑学视角，所提出的结构为凸包计算、孔洞检测、聚类和异常检测等问题的算法开发提供了有效平台。

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习原子间势能模型在分布外数据和数据稀缺情况下预测不准确，且缺乏不确定性估计，无法指导主动学习和确保模拟精度

Method: 基于自适应变分dropout的可扩展架构无关变分贝叶斯框架，可训练或微调MLIPs，兼容等变消息传递架构

Result: 在计算化学任务中显示出比标准MLIPs更好的预测准确性，提供可信的不确定性估计，特别是在数据稀缺和分布外场景下

Conclusion: BLIP框架能够为MLIPs提供校准的不确定性估计，在数据稀缺和分布外情况下表现优异，微调预训练模型可获得一致性性能提升

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

*Jason R Brown,Carl Henrik Ek,Robert D Mullins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEOPARD算法通过整合偏好反馈和专家演示来学习奖励函数，在有限数据情况下显著优于现有基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中复杂任务难以指定好的奖励函数，现有方法结合偏好和演示数据往往不够灵活或难以扩展

Method: 提出reward-rational partial orderings框架，开发LEOPARD算法，能够从多种反馈类型（包括负面演示）中学习奖励函数

Result: 在有限偏好和演示反馈下，LEOPARD显著优于现有基线方法，组合多种反馈类型通常比单一反馈更有效

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一个灵活可扩展的框架，能够有效利用多种人类反馈类型来学习奖励函数，在复杂任务中表现出色

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

*Joshua Brakensiek,Venkatesan Guruswami,Aaron Putterman*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了随机CSP（约束满足问题）的稀疏化问题，在r-partite模型和uniform模型中发现稀疏化阈值现象，并给出了不同谓词P的稀疏化条件和构造方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究随机CSP实例的稀疏化问题，即如何找到最稀疏的重新加权方案，使得对于所有可能的赋值，满足约束的数量在(1±ε)因子内保持不变。

Method: 分析两种随机模型：r-partite模型（将变量分成r部分，每部分随机选一个变量形成约束）和uniform模型（从变量池中随机选择r个不同变量形成约束）。通过理论分析确定稀疏化阈值和构造方法。

Result: 在r-partite模型中，每个谓词P存在整数k，当m≤n^k时无法稀疏化，当m≥n^k时可稀疏化到≈n^k大小。在uniform模型中，当m≤n^k时无法稀疏化，当m≥n^{k+1}时可稀疏化到≈n^k大小，但在[n^k, n^{k+1}]区间内稀疏化行为复杂，甚至存在非单调性。

Conclusion: 随机CSP的稀疏化存在明确的阈值现象，不同随机模型下的稀疏化行为有显著差异，特别是uniform模型中存在复杂的非单调行为，研究提供了精确的可计算判定方法。

Abstract: The problem of CSP sparsification asks: for a given CSP instance, what is the
sparsest possible reweighting such that for every possible assignment to the
instance, the number of satisfied constraints is preserved up to a factor of $1
\pm \epsilon$? We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In
particular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and
the uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning
the variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one
vertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen
at random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.
  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. For every
predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$
vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and
can be sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^k$. Here, $k$ corresponds
to the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$. Furthermore,
these sparsifiers are simple, as they can be constructed by i.i.d. sampling of
the edges.
  In the uniform model, the situation is a bit more complex. For every
predicate $P$, there is an integer $k$ such that a random instance on $n$
vertices and $m$ edges cannot (essentially) be sparsified if $m \le n^k$ and
can sparsified to size $\approx n^k$ if $m \ge n^{k+1}$. However, for some
predicates $P$, if $m \in [n^k, n^{k+1}]$, there may or may not be a nontrivial
sparsifier. In fact, we show that there are predicates where the
sparsifiability of random instances is non-monotone, i.e., as we add more
random constraints, the instances become more sparsifiable. We give a precise
(efficiently computable) procedure for determining which situation a specific
predicate $P$ falls into.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究二维装箱问题的推广版本，其中每个箱子是水平时间线，矩形任务需要分配到最少数量的箱子中，确保任何时间点的任务高度总和不超过给定容量限制

Method: 基于通用框架计算较大任务的结构化解，同时通过一维装箱First-Fit算法的推广来处理较小任务，针对不同任务类型设计特定近似算法

Result: 证明当任务高度较小或为正方形时，问题难以在2倍以内近似；为这些情况提供最优近似算法，并为一般情况提供3倍近似算法

Conclusion: 建立了2D需求装箱问题的近似难度界限，并开发了有效的近似算法框架，为实际应用中的资源分配问题提供了理论保证

Abstract: We study a two-dimensional generalization of the classical Bin Packing
problem, denoted as 2D Demand Bin Packing. In this context, each bin is a
horizontal timeline, and rectangular tasks (representing electric appliances or
computational requirements) must be allocated into the minimum number of bins
so that the sum of the heights of tasks at any point in time is at most a given
constant capacity. We prove that simple variants of the problem are NP-hard to
approximate within a factor better than $2$, namely when tasks have short
height and when they are squares, and provide best-possible approximation
algorithms for them; we also present a simple $3$-approximation for the general
case. All our algorithms are based on a general framework that computes
structured solutions for relatively large tasks, while including relatively
small tasks on top via a generalization of the well-known First-Fit algorithm
for Bin Packing.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 首次提出并发双端优先队列(DEPQ)实现，通过在线性化单消费者优先队列基础上添加ExtractMax操作，构建线性化双消费者DEPQ，并采用基于锁的组合方案支持多消费者。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有并发优先队列主要支持单端操作(ExtractMin)，缺乏专门针对双端优先队列(DEPQ)的并发实现方案，需要解决同时支持ExtractMin和ExtractMax操作的并发访问问题。

Method: 1) 使用两个线性化单消费者优先队列构建双消费者DEPQ；2) 采用基于锁的组合方案支持多消费者访问；3) 以基于列表的优先队列为例验证技术可行性。

Result: 成功实现了第一个专门的并发DEPQ实现，该构造保持了无锁特性，并能通过组合方案扩展支持多消费者操作。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通用方法可将任何支持Insert和ExtractMin的并发优先队列扩展为支持ExtractMax的双端队列，为并发DEPQ提供了可行的实现方案。

Abstract: This work provides the first concurrent implementation specifically designed
for a double-ended priority queue (DEPQ). We do this by describing a general
way to add an ExtractMax operation to any concurrent priority queue that
already supports Insert and ExtractMin operations. The construction uses two
linearizable single-consumer priority queues to build a linearizable
dual-consumer DEPQ (only one process can perform Extract operations at each
end). This construction preserves lock-freedom. We then describe how to use a
lock-based combining scheme to allow multiple consumers at each end of the
DEPQ. To illustrate the technique, we apply it to a list-based priority queue.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在考虑图对称性（自同构）的情况下高效生成所有不等价生成树的问题，避免重复计算对称等价的生成树。

Method: 提出了针对不同方向性串并联图的算法：1）有向串并联图（终端区分源汇）；2）半有向串并联图（终端区分但不指定源汇）；3）无向串并联图。算法利用图的递归结构，不显式计算自同构群。

Result: 对于有向串并联图，实现了输出线性时间生成不等价生成树；成功将算法扩展到半有向情况；对无向情况提出了观察和开放问题。

Conclusion: 所提算法有效利用了串并联图的自同构群递归结构，避免了显式计算自同构群，为对称性感知的生成树生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of generating the spanning trees of
a graph $G$ up to the automorphisms or "symmetries" of $G$. After introducing
and surveying this problem for general input graphs, we present algorithms that
fully solve the case of series-parallel graphs, under two standard definitions.
We first show how to generate the nonequivalent spanning trees of a oriented
series-parallel graph $G$ in output-linear time, where both terminals of $G$
have been individually distinguished (i.e. applying an automorphism that
exchanges the terminals produces a different series-parallel graph).
Subsequently, we show how to adapt these oriented algorithms to the case of
semioriented series-parallel graphs, where we still have a set of two
distinguished terminals but neither has been designated as a source or sink.
Finally, we discuss the case of unoriented series-parallel graphs, where no
terminals have been distinguished and present a few observations and open
questions relating to them. The algorithms we present generate the
nonequivalent spanning trees of $G$ but never explicitly compute the
automorphism group of $G$, revealing how the recursive structure of $G$'s
automorphism group mirrors that of its spanning trees.

Motivation: 解决在有向有界树宽图中是否能高效找到除有向路径外的其他子有向图的问题，探索有向树宽算法的局限性。

Method: 通过提出一系列正面和负面结果，推广文献中的多个结论，分析不同子有向图在有向有界树宽图中的可计算性。

Conclusion: 有向树宽的算法性质相比无向情况更为有限，星形结构是除路径外唯一表现良好的子有向图类型，为后续研究提供了方向。

Abstract: It is well known that directed treewidth does not enjoy the nice algorithmic
properties of its undirected counterpart. There exist, however, some positive
results that, essentially, present XP algorithms for the problem of finding, in
a given digraph $D$, a subdigraph isomorphic to a digraph $H$ that can be
formed by the union of $k$ directed paths (with some extra properties),
parameterized by $k$ and the directed treewidth of $D$. Our motivation is to
tackle the following question: Are there subdigraphs, other than the directed
paths, that can be found efficiently in digraphs of bounded directed treewidth?
In a nutshell, the main message of this article is that, other than the
directed paths, the only digraphs that seem to behave well with respect to
directed treewidth are the stars. For this, we present a number of positive and
negative results, generalizing several results in the literature, as well as
some directions for further research.

TL;DR: CT-CRS是一个融合消费者类型建模的对话推荐系统，通过实时推断用户决策风格和知识水平，动态调整推荐策略，显著提高了推荐成功率和交互效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统大多忽视了用户异质性的决策风格和知识水平，这限制了系统的准确性和效率。需要一种能够理解用户心理特征并据此个性化调整推荐策略的方法

Method: 基于消费者类型理论定义四类用户（依赖型、效率型、谨慎型、专家型），利用交互历史和微调大语言模型实时推断用户类型，采用逆向强化学习优化对话策略，设计类型自适应策略动态调整推荐粒度、多样性和属性查询复杂度

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp数据集上的实验表明，CT-CRS相比强基线提高了推荐成功率并减少了交互轮次。消融研究证实消费者类型建模和逆向强化学习都对性能提升有显著贡献

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过整合心理建模和先进策略优化，为增强对话推荐系统的个性化提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the

TL;DR: FLAIR是一个轻量级反馈学习框架，通过整合领域专家反馈来优化copilot系统的检索策略，采用离线-在线两阶段方法提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂技术场景中的应用日益增多，需要专门的检索解决方案来提升copilot系统的检索效果

Method: 两阶段框架：离线阶段从用户反馈和文档生成的问题中获取指标并分散存储；在线阶段采用双轨排序机制结合原始相似度分数和收集的指标

Result: 在真实环境评估中，FLAIR在已见和未见查询上都取得了显著性能提升，超越了最先进方法，已在Microsoft Copilot DECO中成功部署服务数千用户

Conclusion: FLAIR框架通过反馈学习有效提升了检索性能，展示了在操作环境中的可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven the adoption of
copilots in complex technical scenarios, underscoring the growing need for
specialized information retrieval solutions. In this paper, we introduce FLAIR,
a lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems'
retrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR
operates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user
feedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these
indicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track
ranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected
indicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query.
Extensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance
gains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches. The system has been successfully integrated into Copilot DECO,
serving thousands of users at Microsoft, demonstrating its scalability and
effectiveness in operational environments.

*Lam Thanh Do,Linh Van Nguyen,David Fu,Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CASPER是一个用于科学文献检索的稀疏检索模型，使用标记和关键词作为表示单元，通过挖掘学术参考文献数据来训练，在多个科学检索基准上表现优异，还能用于关键词生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数级增长使研究人员难以跟上文献发展，需要更有效的检索方法来缓解这个问题。

Method: 提出CASPER稀疏检索模型，使用标记和关键词作为表示单元，通过挖掘学术参考文献（标题、引文上下文、作者分配的关键词、共引关系）来构建训练数据。

Result: CASPER在八个科学检索基准上优于强密的和稀疏的检索基线模型，在关键词生成任务中与CopyRNN竞争性表现，产生更多样化的关键词且速度快近四倍。

Conclusion: CASPER通过创新的表示单元设计和训练数据挖掘方法，在科学文献检索和关键词生成方面都取得了显著效果，为解决科学文献爆炸问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly
difficult for researchers to keep up with the literature. In an attempt to
alleviate this problem, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for
scientific search that utilizes tokens and keyphrases as representation units
(i.e. dimensions in the sparse embedding space), enabling it to represent
queries and documents with research concepts and match them at both granular
and conceptual levels. To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we
propose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals
that capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different
settings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and
co-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on
eight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through
simple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase
generation tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established
CopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times
faster.

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: L3AE是首个将大语言模型(LLMs)集成到线性自编码器(LAE)框架中的方法，通过两阶段优化策略有效整合文本语义和用户-物品交互知识，在推荐系统性能上显著超越现有LLM增强模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性自编码器在整合文本信息时依赖稀疏词共现模式，无法充分捕捉丰富的文本语义信息，限制了推荐系统的性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段优化策略：1)从LLM生成的物品表示构建语义物品相关性矩阵；2)从协同信号学习物品权重矩阵，同时将语义相关性作为正则化约束。每个阶段都通过闭式解优化确保全局最优和计算效率。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，L3AE相比最先进的LLM增强模型在Recall@20指标上提升27.6%，在NDCG@20指标上提升39.3%。

Conclusion: L3AE成功将LLMs集成到LAE框架中，有效融合了文本语义和协同信号，显著提升了推荐性能，证明了该方法在语义增强推荐系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Motivation: 传统推荐方法只关注交互意愿而忽视传播能力，IM方法只关注传播范围而忽视交互意愿，需要综合解决这两个挑战

Method: HeteroIR采用两阶段框架估计传播收益，HeteroIM通过反向可达(RR)集进行增量选择和重排名，结合交互意愿和传播能力

Result: 实验结果显示两个模型都显著超过最新基准方法(p-value < 0.05)，在腾讯游戏平台A/B测试中分别获得8.5%和10%的收益提升

Conclusion: 该研究成功结合了推荐系统和影响力最大化方法的优势，有效解决了用户交互和信息传播的综合问题，具有重要的实践价值

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在长序列建模中破坏了两个基本要求：充分利用完整序列信息和保持行为与目标项的高度相关性，导致在线系统性能受限

Method: 两阶段方法：离线阶段通过度量学习降维后聚类提取准确兴趣；在线阶段使用预提取兴趣预测与目标项的关联，整个流程采用统一的相关性度量

Result: 与最先进方法的广泛实验比较证明了ENCODE的有效性和效率

Conclusion: ENCODE方法成功满足了长序列建模的两个基本要求，在在线服务效率和精度之间取得了理想平衡

Abstract: Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore
users' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging
to accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior
sequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet
such requirements, existing methods "inadvertently" destroy two basic
requirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire
sequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information
from the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned
interests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems
is significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest
information obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient
two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering
based twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction
stage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two
basic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service
efficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE
clusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To
reduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric
learning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative
pairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online
inference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the
associations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance
between user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric
throughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and
comparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed ENCODE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统只推荐与用户主要兴趣最相关的物品，忽略了用户次要兴趣领域，这会损害用户体验。需要开发能够保证推荐列表包含代表性不足类别的校准推荐系统。

Method: 使用三维G维分布（用户档案分布、候选物品分布、推荐列表分布）建模，实现了15个模型来分析这些分布的结构，并在三个电影数据集上评估用户模式。

Result: 异常检测模型提供了对分布结构的更好理解，校准系统创建的推荐列表与传统推荐列表表现相似，但允许用户以相同程度改变其偏好组。

Conclusion: 校准推荐系统通过多维分布建模有效解决了传统推荐系统忽略次要兴趣的问题，异常检测模型是理解这些分布结构的有力工具，系统在保持推荐质量的同时改善了多样性。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

TL;DR: 提出了MUFFIN模型，通过全局和局部滤波模块结合用户自适应滤波，解决了现有频域序列推荐模型中频带覆盖有限和缺乏个性化频率过滤的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有频域序列推荐模型存在两个主要缺陷：频带覆盖范围有限，可能错过特定频率范围内的关键行为模式；缺乏个性化频率过滤，对所有用户使用相同的滤波器，忽略了用户独特的频率特征。

Method: 提出MUFFIN模型，包含两个互补模块：全局滤波模块(GFM)处理整个频谱以捕捉全面的行为模式；局部滤波模块(LFM)有选择地强调重要频带而不排除其他范围的信息；两个模块都采用用户自适应滤波器(UAF)来生成针对个体独特特征的用户特定频率滤波器。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MUFFIN始终优于最先进的频域序列推荐模型。

Conclusion: MUFFIN通过聚合两个模块，能够捕捉用户在整个频谱上的多样化行为模式，有效解决了现有频域模型的局限性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions
by modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency
domain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.
However, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:
(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns
in a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency
filtering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their
distinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg
(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering
module (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive
behavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively
emphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other
ranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to
generate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique
characteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse
user behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive
experiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
frequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets. The source code is

Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏数据时存在两个主要限制：简单的多模态特征对比无法产生有效表示，导致噪声模态共享特征和模态独特特征信息丢失；缺乏对用户兴趣和物品共现同构关系的探索，导致用户-物品交互挖掘不完整

Method: 提出REARM框架：1) 使用元网络和正交约束策略补充多模态对比学习，过滤模态共享特征中的噪声并保留模态独特特征中的推荐相关信息；2) 整合新构建的用户兴趣图和物品共现图与现有用户共现图和物品语义图进行图学习

Conclusion: REARM通过改进的多模态对比学习和同构图关系挖掘，有效解决了多模态推荐系统中的数据稀疏性问题，显著提升了推荐性能

Abstract: Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (
i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these
methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although
contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.
  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for
\textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning
and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement
multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal
constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and
retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine
homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user
interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user
co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM
to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an
improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and
modal-unique features. Code is available

Conclusion: UniECS在实验和实际场景中都证明了其有效性，为电商多模态检索提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

*Jiazheng Jing,Yinan Zhang,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 通过推荐系统主动引导用户做出更可持续的食物选择，设计了GRAPE推荐系统咄两种绿色损失函数来优化可持续性指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端气候事件促使可持续生活意识提升，但传统行为改变方法要么过于要求高要么只能被动参与，需要更主动的干预方式

Method: 提出GRAPE推荐系统，在考虑用户个性化喜好的同时优先推荐可持续食物选项，设计了两种绿色损失函数（均匀优先级和差异化优先级）来处理不同类型的绿色指标

Result: 在真实数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了GRAPE推荐系统的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推荐系统主动引导用户向可持续选择转变是一种有效的方法，GRAPE系统能够在个性化推荐和可持续性之间取得平衡，为促进绿色消费提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The recent emergence of extreme climate events has significantly raised
awareness about sustainable living. In addition to developing energy-saving
materials and technologies, existing research mainly relies on traditional
methods that encourage behavioral shifts towards sustainability, which can be
overly demanding or only passively engaging. In this work, we propose to employ
recommendation systems to actively nudge users toward more sustainable choices.
We introduce Green Recommender Aligned with Personalized Eating (GRAPE), which
is designed to prioritize and recommend sustainable food options that align
with users' evolving preferences. We also design two innovative Green Loss
functions that cater to green indicators with either uniform or differentiated
priorities, thereby enhancing adaptability across a range of scenarios.
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our GRAPE.

*Chuang Li,Yang Deng,Hengchang Hu,See-Kiong Ng,Min-Yen Kan,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了CARE框架，将大语言模型与外部推荐系统结合，通过实体级洞察和上下文信息增强对话推荐系统的准确性和减少偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前基于LLM的对话推荐系统面临的两个主要挑战：1) 无领域适应时推荐超出目标物品空间的项目，准确率低；2) 过度依赖对话上下文进行内容推荐，忽视实体间的协作关系和物品序列

Method: CARE框架：a) 集成外部推荐系统作为领域专家，通过实体级洞察生成推荐；b) 利用上下文信息增强推荐，使用LLM进行更准确和无偏的最终推荐

Result: 在ReDial和INSPIRED数据集上，推荐准确率分别平均提升54%和25%。最有效策略是LLM基于上下文洞察选择和重排外部推荐器提供的候选物品

Conclusion: CARE框架有效解决了识别出的挑战，并减轻了外部推荐器的流行度偏差，显著提升了LLM-based对话推荐系统的性能

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with
external recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational
recommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-
or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,
but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific
adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,
resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue
context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative
relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,
we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE
customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation
systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,
producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those
recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and
unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that
incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information
significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average
of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in
the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that
external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis
indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified
challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文重新考察并扩展了用于神经信息检索的合成查询生成流水线，通过InPars工具包利用大语言模型生成训练数据，并提出了两个关键扩展来提升查询质量和检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有合成查询生成流水线的可复现性，并解决传统方法需要激进过滤的问题，通过提升生成查询的质量来改善检索性能。

Method: 使用InPars工具包进行可复现的结构化设计，首先验证了InPars、InPars-V2和Promptagator流水线的有效性，然后提出两个扩展：(1)通过对比偏好优化(CPO)微调查询生成器来提升信号质量；(2)使用DSPy框架用动态的思维链(CoT)优化提示替换静态提示模板。

Result: 两种扩展方法都能在减少激进过滤需求的同时提高检索性能，实验结果验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过微调查询生成器和动态提示优化可以显著提升合成查询的质量，从而改善神经信息检索的性能，所有代码、模型和数据集已开源以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large
language models (LLMs). We first assess the reproducibility of the original
InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need
for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code,
models, and synthetic datasets are publicly released to support further

*Hardy,Sebastian Padó,Amelie Wührl,Tanise Ceron*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG)框架，在新闻推荐系统的最早阶段引入多样性，通过可配置机制实现个性化与多样性的灵活权衡，解决现有多样性算法忽视规范性多样性和仅在管道后期应用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点击历史的新闻推荐系统虽然能提高用户参与度，但限制了内容多样性。现有多样性算法存在两个主要局限：一是未能考虑规范性多样性（要求公平获取广泛观点），二是通常在系统管道后期才应用多样性，此时大量内容已被过滤，限制了其有效性。

Method: 使用多维度视角（如情感、政治倾向、框架）表示新闻文章，采用VQ-VAE创建离散的多方面表示。通过仅解码器模型学习用户对这些方面代码的偏好，在候选检索过程中通过反转查询向量某些方面的符号来直接注入多样性。

Result: 在MIND数据集上的评估表明，该方法能在推荐管道早期实现个性化与多样性的灵活权衡，生成更新颖、多样和意外的候选内容，同时有效考虑加强民主价值观的方面。

Conclusion: A2CG是一个有前景的方法，可为下游民主化新闻推荐系统提供有效支持，通过早期多样性注入和可配置机制更好地促进真正的规范性多样性。

Abstract: Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for
engagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested
content. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which
requires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically
apply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has
already been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and
prevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.
  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these
limitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline
stage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific
democratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of
perspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted
representation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these
aspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some
of the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring
a more diverse set of candidates.
  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off
between personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It
also generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while
effectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.
These empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream
democratized news recommendation systems.

### [101] [A Convergent Primal-Dual Algorithm for Computing Rate-Distortion-Perception Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13486)
*Chunhui Chen,Linyi Chen,Xueyan Niu,Hao Wu*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种具有严格收敛保证的新理论框架咇算法，用于计算率盈-失真-感知（RDP）函数，解决了现有方法缺乏理论保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RDP函数计算方法缺乏理论保证，特别是在复杂的感知约束下存在非凸性咇计算难处理性问题，需要开发具有严格收敛性的算法。

Method: 通过放松重构分布的约束，将其替换为对重构分布本身的替代优化方法，开发了新的原对偶算法。

Result: 算法实现了O(1/n)的收敛速率，在代表性场景中获得了竞争性的实验性能，填补了现有理论的关键空白。

Conclusion: 该方法为RDP约束压缩系统提供了更可靠咇可解释的优化基础，实验结果验证了算法的高效性咇准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Rate-Distortion-Perception (RDP) theory highlight the
importance of balancing compression level, reconstruction quality, and
perceptual fidelity. While previous work has explored numerical approaches to
approximate the information RDP function, the lack of theoretical guarantees
remains a major limitation, especially in the presence of complex perceptual
constraints that introduce non-convexity and computational intractability.
Inspired by our previous constrained Blahut-Arimoto algorithm for solving the
rate-distortion function, in this paper, we present a new theoretical framework
for computing the information RDP function by relaxing the constraint on the
reconstruction distribution and replacing it with an alternative optimization
approach over the reconstruction distribution itself. This reformulation
significantly simplifies the optimization and enables a rigorous proof of
convergence. Based on this formulation, we develop a novel primal-dual
algorithm with provable convergence guarantees. Our analysis establishes, for
the first time, a rigorous convergence rate of $O(1/n)$ for the computation of
RDP functions. The proposed method not only bridges a key theoretical gap in
the existing literature but also achieves competitive empirical performance in
representative settings. These results lay the groundwork for more reliable and
interpretable optimization in RDP-constrained compression systems. Experimental
results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了量子局部可恢复码(qLRCs)的新边界和构造方法，解决了Luo等人提出的开放问题，构建了三个最优qLRCs家族，参数比已知CSS构造的qLRCs更灵活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子局部可恢复码在大规模量子数据存储和量子LDPC码方面具有重要应用潜力，需要解决现有构造方法的局限性。

Method: 采用Hermitian构造方法，构建了多个具有灵活维度的NMDS码家族，支持t-designs(t=2,3)，并应用于获得Hermitian对偶包含的经典LRCs。

Result: 提出了qLRCs的四个边界，构造了三个最优qLRCs显式家族，相比已知CSS构造的qLRCs提供了新的灵活参数。

Conclusion: 所构造的量子局部可恢复码不仅在量子领域具有最优性能，其对应的经典LRCs也在四个不同边界下达到最优，具有重要的理论和应用价值。

Abstract: In a recent work, quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs) have been
introduced for their potential application in large-scale quantum data storage
and implication for quantum LDPC codes. This work focuses on the bounds and
constructions of qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction, which solves an
open problem proposed by Luo $et~al.$ (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 71 (3):
1794-1802, 2025). We present four bounds for qLRCs and give comparisons in
terms of their asymptotic formulas. We construct several new infinite families
of NMDS codes, with general and flexible dimensions, that support t-designs for
$t\in \{2,3\}$, and apply them to obtain Hermitian dual-containing classical
LRCs (cLRCs). As a result, we derive three explicit families of optimal qLRCs.
Compared to the known qLRCs obtained by the CSS construction, our optimal qLRCs
offer new and more flexible parameters. It is also worth noting that the
constructed cLRCs themselves are interesting as they are optimal with respect
to four distinct bounds for cLRCs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究瑞利块衰落信道中无密钥隐蔽通信的功率和速率分配问题，提出了基于非因果和因果CSI知识的不同优化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无线通信中实现隐蔽通信，特别是在Rayleigh块衰落信道环境下，当发送方和合法接收方具有信道状态信息而窃听者只有统计信息时，如何优化功率和速率分配来最大化隐蔽率或最小化功耗

Method: 对于非因果CSI情况，提出三步法解决功率和速率分配问题；对于因果CSI情况，将功率分配问题建模为MDP并使用DDQN方法求解，速率分配问题则使用训练好的DDQN近似求解

Result: 仿真结果验证了所提功率和速率分配方法的有效性，并对不同分配方案进行了全面的性能比较

Conclusion: 论文成功解决了Rayleigh块衰落信道中隐蔽通信的优化问题，为不同CSI知识场景提供了有效的功率和速率分配方案

Abstract: We aim to achieve keyless covert communication with a positive-rate in
Rayleigh block-fading channels. Specifically, the transmitter and the
legitimate receiver are assumed to have either causal or non-causal knowledge
of the \ac{CSI} for both the legitimate and the warden channels, while the
warden only knows the statistical distribution of the \ac{CSI}. Two problem
formulations are considered in this work: (a) Power allocation: maximizing the
sum covert rate subject to a maximum power constraint, and (b) Rate allocation:
minimizing the power consumption subject to a minimum covert rate constraint.
Both problems are formulated based on recent information theoretical results on
covert communication over state-dependent channels. When the \ac{CSI} of each
fading block is known non-causally, we propose a novel three-step method to
solve both the power and rate allocation problems. In the case where the
\ac{CSI} is known causally, the power allocation problem can be formulated as
\ac{MDP} and be solved using a \ac{DDQN} approach. Although the rate allocation
problem under causal \ac{CSI} does not directly conform to an \ac{MDP}
structure, it can be approximately solved using the \ac{DDQN} trained for power
allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
power and rate allocation methods and provide comprehensive performance
comparisons across different allocation schemes.

TL;DR: 大规模MIMO系统中部署无线中继器群来改善覆盖，研究解决中继器互相作用导致的正反馈问题和性能优化。提出稳定性判据和迭代优化算法，验证了中继器在不同频段的性能提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模MIMO系统中部署无线中继器群时遇到的两个核心问题：如何避免中继器互相作用导致的破坏性正反馈，以及如何在中继器注入噪声和干扰的情况下最大化系统性能。

Method: 首先推导了中继器群系统的广义Nyquist稳定性判据，提供了容易检查的稳定性条件。然后研究了上行链路性能，开发了一种高效的迭代算法，联合优化中继器增益、用户发射功率和接收组合权重，以最大化加权和速率同时确保系统稳定性。

Result: 数值结果验证了理论发现，显示中继器能够在次-6GHz和毫米波频段显著提升系统性能。结果还表明需要注意部署方式，例如确保中继器与基站之间有高概率的视线链路。

Conclusion: 无线中继器群可以作为一种低成本、即插即用的解决方案有效改善大规模MIMO系统的覆盖性能。通过理论分析和优化算法，成功解决了稳定性和性能优化的关键问题，为实际部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters
are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with
small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They
can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent
to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with
amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in
repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive
feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and
amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be
achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more
interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist
stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check
stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an
efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user
transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum
rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our
theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the
system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results
also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for
example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between
repeaters and the base station.

Abstract: This paper investigates a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system and proposes a joint
communication and sensing beamforming design based on non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) technology. The system employs a dual-functional base station
(DFBS) to simultaneously serve multiple users and sense multiple targets with
the aid of RIS. To maximize the sum-rate of users, we jointly optimize the
DFBS's active beamforming, the RIS's reflection coefficients, and the radar
receive filters. The optimization is performed under constraints including the
radar signal-to-noise ratio thresholds, the user
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio requirements, the phase shifts of the
RIS, the total transmit power, the receive filters, and the successive
interference cancellation decoding order. To tackle the complex
interdependencies and non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we
introduce an effective iterative algorithm based on the alternating
optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms, highlighting its distinct advantages
in the considered RIS-empowered NOMA-ISAC systems.

Conclusion: 链式机器人为多机器人系统提供了一种高效、可学习的绘制方案，开源代码和模型为该领域研究提供了良好基础

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有LLM能处理百万token上下文，但缺乏人类主动管理外部记忆的认知能力，需要从被动检索向主动认知扩展转变

Method: 基于Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智理论等认知科学理论，设计了三核心创新：主动记忆管理、层次认知缓冲区、任务驱动上下文优化

Result: 平均内存重用率达到58.6%（传统RAG为0%），网络效率提升17-18%，统计显著性p<0.001，Cohen's d>23

Conclusion: 认知工作空间代表了从信息检索向真正认知增强的基本转变，为LLM系统提供了量化证据

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

Motivation: 现有alpha挖掘评估方法存在局限性：回测计算密集且对策略参数敏感；相关性指标只评估预测能力而忽略其他重要属性；大多数模型闭源阻碍了可复现性。

Method: 提出AlphaEval框架，通过五个互补维度（预测能力、稳定性、鲁棒性、金融逻辑性、多样性）来综合评估生成的alpha质量，避免了传统回测的计算负担。

Result: 在代表性alpha挖掘算法上的广泛实验表明，AlphaEval实现了与全面回测相当的评估一致性，同时提供更全面的洞察和更高效率，并能有效识别优于传统单指标筛选方法的alpha。

Conclusion: AlphaEval为解决alpha挖掘系统评估挑战提供了有效解决方案，所有实现和评估工具已开源以促进可复现性和社区参与。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several

algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升text-to-SQL模型在实际应用中的基础能力和沿射能力，特别是在WHERE子句语义解析方面的性能

Method: 结合模型可解释性分析和执行引导策略，加入过滤调整、逻辑关联精炼和模型融合技术，设计了条件增强的CESQL模型

Result: 在WikiSQL数据集上表现优异，显著提高了预测结果的准确率，减少了对条件列数据的依赖并避免了手动标注训练数据的影响

Conclusion: 该方法为处理基础数据库查询提供了准确性提升的新视角，为处理复杂查询和实际数据库中不规则数据的研究奠定了基础

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 搜索基于LLM代理的评估存在搜索时污染问题，当浏览器可以从HuggingFace等平台直接找到测试数据集和答案，导致代理凭借拷贝而非真正推理，从而影响评测结果的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和探讨搜索基于LLM代理评估中的新型污染问题，以确保评测结果的真实性和可靠性。

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析代理日志中的搜索结果，检测是否出现测试数据污染，并通过阻塞HuggingFace等测试来验证污染的影响。

Result: 约有3%的问题可以直接从HuggingFace找到包含标签的数据集，阻塞HuggingFace后污染子集的准确率下降约15%，近万次的评估查询可能加速测试集的淘汰。

Conclusion: 提出了对付搜索基于LLM代理评估的最佳实践建议，包括测试设计和结果报告方面的改进，以确保评估的可信过程。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型处理更大规模的多模态输入，token级别的计算成本成为主要瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的，或者与自回归生成不兼容。

Method: 基于注意力范数大小动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器确定token数量，引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算精度权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量同时匹配甚至超过学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成的有效框架。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Motivation: 研究战略决策中瞬时机会与长期目标的拉换关系，通过棋牌模型比较人类与AI在维持战略强度方面的差异

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子互动指标来定量棋局战略强度，分析人类vs人类和AIvsAI对局的动态变化

Result: AI玩家能维持更高水平的战略强度更长时间；人类游戏的累积强度在Elo分数1600和2300附近出现突变；AI对复杂互联局面具有更高容忍力，而人类则选择限制复杂性

Conclusion: AI与人类在复杂战略环境中采取不同策略，这可能体现了人类的认知限制，对于AI在复杂战略领域的应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Method: 明确定义了多跳个性化推理任务，构建了数据集和统一评估框架，实现了各种显式和隐式记忆方法，并探索了混合方法，提出了HybridMem方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决个性化信息的多跳推理问题提供了新的任务定义、数据集和评估框架，提出的HybridMem方法有效解决了现有记忆方法的局限性，为研究社区提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和代理设计可广泛适用于不同材料，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

Method: 设计多模态CardAIc-Agents框架：CardiacRAG代理生成可更新的心血知识计划，主代理集成工具执行计划。采用步进更新策略动态精炼计划，多学科讨论工具处理复杂案例，视觉审查面板支持临床验证

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents框架通过外部工具增强、适应性理解和多模态交互，有效解决了心血血管AI诊断中的关键挑战，为临床应用提供了更加灵活和高效的解决方案

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的自动启发式设计在进化计算框架中效果受限，主要原因是使用静态算子且缺乏知识积累机制，无法实现持续学习和改进。

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后顾性提示从过往成功启发式中提炼可重用设计原则，构建持久知识库。

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于现有LLM-based AHD方法，能够生成更高质量的启发式，同时实现更快的收敛速度和更优的查询效率。

Conclusion: HiFo-Prompt通过前瞻性和后顾性提示的双重机制，成功将瞬时发现转化为持久知识，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效的知识积累框架。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

Motivation: 现实金融文档中的表格信息往往被埋藏在混乱、多页、碎片化的表格中（99.4%的表格没有边界框），传统表格检测方法难以有效处理这些复杂的真实场景。

Method: 采用智能代理系统执行表格检测、分类、提取和推荐，利用初始模式并通过推荐代理审查输出、建议模式修订，实现持续学习过程。

Result: TASER比Table Transformer等现有表格检测模型性能提升10.1%，大批次训练使可操作模式建议增加104.3%，提取持仓增加9.8%。构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格的真实金融数据集。

Conclusion: 智能模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面具有巨大潜力，持续学习过程对于处理复杂真实表格至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态的输入嵌入到统一的语义空间中，提升跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态参数高效微调方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化能力。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中收敛，无论其模态如何。该设计具有固有可扩展性，支持无缝集成额外模态。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了具有竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习的嵌入空间中保持了高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐嵌入结构（而不仅仅是调整适配器权重）对于可扩展多模态学习的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

Conclusion: STPFormer通过统一的时空模式感知表示学习，成功解决了复杂交通预测中的时空建模挑战，为时空预测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world
datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation
and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出离散最小-最大违规(DMMV)优化问题，开发GPU加速测略算法，在语言模型量化、离散断层成像和FIR滤波器设计中取得显著改善


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有最坏情况性能要求的广泛优化问题，需要一个通用的数学框架来形式化这类问题并提供高效解法

Method: 定义DMMV数学问题，分析其性质，开发GPU加速的测略算法，利用DMMV的数学特性加速求解过程

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升15%，离散断层成像重建误差降低16%且GPU速度提升6倍，FIR滤波器设计波红减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个通用优化框架具有广泛的应用前景，提出的GPU加速测略算法在多个领域都取得显著效果，将开源以促进进一步研究

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

TL;DR: 语言模型代理在安全知识与实际执行之间存在显著空间，研究发现他们虽然知道风险但在实际场景中无法有效识别和避免风险行为，通过风险验证器系统可大幅度减少风险执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在自动化实际任务时带来严重安全风险，研究发现他们的风险认知能力与安全执行能力存在显著差距，需要系统性地评估和改善。

Method: 开发了一个综合评估框架，从三个逐渐进的维度检查代理安全性：1)风险知识 2)执行轨迹中风险识别能力 3)避免风险行为的实际能力。基于观察到的空间，开发了一个风险验证器系统，包括独立批判代理建议行动的验证器和将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述以更有效识别风险的抽象器。

Result: 评估显示代理在风险知识方面表现几乎完美（>98%通过率），但在实际场景中识别风险时性能下降23%以上，并且经常仍然执行风险行为（<26%通过率）。这种趋势在更强大的模型和专门的推理模型中仍然存在。风险验证器系统实现了风险行为执行的55.3%显著减少。

Conclusion: 简单扩展模型能力或推理计算并不能本质解决安全问题，语言模型代理的风险认知与安全执行之间存在系统性空间。通过风险验证器系统可以有效减少风险行为，为提升LM代理安全性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo通过提供基础模型和工具套件，成功将Crafter环境变成一个高效、轻量的原型制作环境，帮助研究人员更快速地进行普适性体现代理的开发和测试

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖混合范式，LLM仅作为冻结的先验检索器，无法提升其内在推理能力，且继承了DL模型的泛化限制

Method: 两阶段训练：1）使用专家指导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量推理轨迹初始化策略；2）通过强化学习将LLM注意力与专家模型识别的临床显著特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实EHR数据集上平均提升14.62%的推理能力，增强了对特征扰动和未见临床领域的鲁棒性和泛化性

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been
available at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文探索了多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法，通过多级别奖励系统突破了直接监督学习在图表转代码任务中的性能平台，在两个标准测试集上实现了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在视觉-语言模型中有效，但在需要深度理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表转代码任务需要复杂的视觉理解和结构化输出，但直接监督学习往往不够有效，需要更有效的强化学习策略。

Method: 提出多模态结构化强化学习(MSRL)方法：1)构建了最大的训练语料库（包含300万个图表-代码对）；2)采用多级别结构化奖励系统，包括文本层面的规则基础奖励（验证细粒度代码细节）和视觉层面的模型基础奖励（通过渲染代码为图像并使用评估模型评估结构相似性）；3)采用两阶段课程学习策略保证训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL方法显著突破了直接监督学习的性能平台：在ChartMimic测试集上高级指标提升6.2%，在ReachQA测试集上提升9.9%，达到了与充分开发的闭源模型相竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了多模态结构化强化学习在复杂的视觉-语言任务中的有效性，通过结合文本和视觉评估的多级别奖励系统，成功解决了直接监督学习在结构化输出生成任务中的性能平台问题。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法，通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心-边缘区分问题，在ScreenSpot基准上达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法依赖边界框或中心点回归，忽略了空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构。现有注意力方法存在两个关键问题：(1)忽略处理背景区域导致注意力漂移；(2)统一标注无法区分目标UI元素的中心和边缘，导致点击不精确。

Method: V2P方法包含两个核心组件：1)抑制注意力机制，最小化模型对无关区域的关注以突出目标区域；2)基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘逐渐减小，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试中分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。消融实验证实了各组件对性能的贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法有效隔离目标区域并教导模型专注于UI元素的最关键点，展示了在精确GUI定位任务中的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱查询方法主要基于一阶逻辑，无法处理现实世界中常见的模糊或上下文相关的软约束（如属性偏好或相关类别偏好）。

Method: 提出神经查询重排序器(NQR)，通过交互式方式基于偏好的正负实体示例来调整查询答案分数，整合软约束。扩展现有QA基准生成包含软约束的数据集。

Result: 实验证明NQR能够有效捕获软约束，同时保持稳健的查询回答性能。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了知识图谱查询中处理软约束的空白，为现实应用中更灵活的查询需求提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME框枵有效解决了LIME在数据约束环境下的局部性和不稳定性问题，通过实例转移学习和对比学习权重机制，显著提升了解释的保真度和可靠性

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决第三方简历与公司人才库简历之间的重复检测问题，提升简历质量和人才库丰富度。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

Method: 提出CausalPlan两阶段框架，核心是结构因果行动(SCA)模型，从智能体轨迹学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策，然后使用因果分数对LLM生成的行动提案进行重新加权

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试的五个多智能体协调任务和四个不同规模的LLM上评估，CausalPlan持续减少无效行动并改善AI-AI和人类-AI设置中的协作，优于强化学习基线

Conclusion: 因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多智能体LLM系统具有重要价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可实现干预一致的行为

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: 提出了EMRC框架，通过专家感知的多LLM招募与协作来提升医疗决策的准确性和可靠性，在三个公开数据集上优于现有最佳方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个大语言模型在医疗决策中存在参数知识限制和静态训练语料的局限性，无法有效整合复杂的临床信息

Method: 两阶段框架：1）专家感知的代理招募，构建LLM专业能力表动态选择最优模型；2）置信度和对抗驱动的多代理协作，通过置信度融合和对抗验证提升诊断可靠性

Result: 在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比最佳闭源模型GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过利用不同LLM的专业能力互补，显著提升了医疗决策系统的性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Motivation: 量词化公式在SMT求解器中面临本质上的不可判定性，现有实例化技术存在补充性，需要更有效的方法来处理量词推理。

Method: 将观察到的实例化作为潜在语言的样本，使用概率上下文自由语法生成新的相似项。方法包括模仿成功实例化和通过反转学习到的项概率来探索多样性。

Result: 提出了一种能够动态学习现有实例化技术的新方法，通过概率模型生成新的相似项，并在量词推理中实现排他与探索的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为SMT求解器处理量词化公式提供了一种创新的实例化接口，通过概率性语言模型结合了现有技术的优势，提高了量词推理的效果。

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 当前单个RAG框架无法良好适应广泛的下游任务，需要研究如何利用多个RAG系统的优势来提升性能。

Method: 从理论角度通过信息熵解释RAG集成框架，从机制角度分析四种管道（分支、迭代、循环、代理）和三种模块（生成器、检索器、重排器），解决7个不同研究问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，无论在管道层面还是模块层面，聚合多个RAG系统都具有良好的通用性和稳健性。

Conclusion: 本研究为多RAG系统集成相关研究奠定了基础，证明了多系统集成在RAG领域的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思和多程序选择等扩展技术，有效提高了LLM生成广义计划的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Motivation: 金融市场时间序列数据建模面临高性能、可解释性和可审计性的挑战，现有AutoML框架缺乏对领域特定需求和动态目标的适应性，而LLM智能体系统提供了更灵活的工作流自动化路径。

Method: 设计模块化智能体框架，包含规划器智能体和结构化知识库，采用三阶段迭代决策过程：模型选择、代码优化和微调，通过上下文推理和实验反馈指导探索。

Result: 在多样化金融预测和合成数据生成任务上的实证评估表明，TS-Agent在准确性、鲁棒性和决策可追溯性方面持续优于最先进的AutoML和智能体基线。

Conclusion: TS-Agent支持自适应学习、鲁棒调试和透明审计，满足了金融服务等高风险环境的关键需求，为时间序列建模提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Method: 使用大型语言模型驱动的生成式AI代理在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，设计包含供应商管理库存原则的协作AI代理，并分析其行为趋势。

Result: 发现了"协作悖论"现象，协作AI代理表现比非AI基准更差，原因是代理囤积库存导致系统瘫痪。通过结合高层AI驱动的主动策略制定和低层协作执行协议的双层框架，成功实现了系统韧性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协作AI代理的新兴行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了重要见解和蓝图，强调需要结合高层策略和低层执行的综合方法。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Motivation: 最长连续子序列(LRS)问题是一个NP难组合优化问题，在生物信息学和基因组重新组装中有重要应用，需要高效的求解算法

Method: 采用偏向随机键遗传算法(BRKGA)，重点关注个体评估的计算效率，将灰度值向量转换为有效解。同时开发了Max-Min蚂蚁系统和使用CPLEX整数规划求解器进行对比

Result: 计算结果显示所提出的BRKGA方法是目前解决LRS问题的最先进技术，在性能上超过了蚂蚁系统和CPLEX求解器

Conclusion: 虽然BRKGA在LRS问题上表现优异，但在大字母表大小的输入字符串上仍有改进空间，需要进一步优化算法性能

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV分离LSM-tree虽然解决了写放大问题，但带来了显著的空间放大问题，现有垃圾回收策略优化不足且未充分考虑索引LSM-tree的空间放大影响。

Method: 提出I/O高效的垃圾回收方案降低I/O开销，并基于补偿大小的空间感知压缩策略来最小化索引LSM-tree的空间放大。

Result: 实验表明Scavenger显著提升写性能，相比BlobDB、Titan和TerarkDB等其他KV分离LSM-tree实现了更低的空间放大。

Conclusion: Scavenger在KV分离LSM-tree中实现了性能与空间放大之间的更好权衡，为成本敏感场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Key-Value Stores (KVS) implemented with log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree)
have gained widespread acceptance in storage systems. Nonetheless, a
significant challenge arises in the form of high write amplification due to the
compaction process. While KV-separated LSM-trees successfully tackle this
issue, they also bring about substantial space amplification problems, a
concern that cannot be overlooked in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage
collection (GC) holds significant promise for space amplification reduction,
yet existing GC strategies often fall short in optimization performance,
lacking thorough consideration of workload characteristics. Additionally,
current KV-separated LSM-trees also ignore the adverse effect of the space
amplification in the index LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze
the sources of space amplification of KV-separated LSM-trees and introduce
Scavenger, which achieves a better trade-off between performance and space
amplification. Scavenger initially proposes an I/O-efficient garbage collection
scheme to reduce I/O overhead and incorporates a space-aware compaction
strategy based on compensated size to minimize the space amplification of index
LSM-trees. Extensive experiments show that Scavenger significantly improves
write performance and achieves lower space amplification than other
KV-separated LSM-trees (including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB).

Method: 提出了Scavenger+系统，包含三个核心组件：(1) I/O高效的垃圾回收方案降低I/O开销；(2) 基于补偿大小的空间感知压缩策略缓解索引引起的空间放大；(3) 动态GC调度器根据系统负载自适应调整，更好地利用CPU和存储资源。

Conclusion: Scavenger+通过系统性的空间放大源分析和创新的优化技术，实现了更好的性能-空间权衡，为KV分离LSM-tree提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Key-Value Stores (KVS) based on log-structured merge-trees (LSM-trees) are
widely used in storage systems but face significant challenges, such as high
write amplification caused by compaction. KV-separated LSM-trees address write
amplification but introduce significant space amplification, a critical concern
in cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) can reduce space
amplification, but existing strategies are often inefficient and fail to
account for workload characteristics. Moreover, current key-value (KV)
separated LSM-trees overlook the space amplification caused by the index
LSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space
amplification in KV-separated LSM-trees and propose Scavenger+, which achieves
a better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an
I/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a
space-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate
index-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts
to system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Scavenger+ significantly improves write
performance and reduces space amplification compared to state-of-the-art
KV-separated LSM-trees, including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB.

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log
usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly
regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Result: 广泛评估显示，SARA平均能减少39.41%的卡顿时间，略微改善0.65%的延迟，同时仅带来0.13%的整体码率损失

Conclusion: SARA是首个专门针对低轨卫星网络设计的解决方案，能有效提升直播流媒体在卫星网络中的观看体验，显著减少卫星切换期间的卡顿事件

Abstract: Live streaming has experienced significant growth recently. Yet this rise in
popularity contrasts with the reality that a substantial segment of the global
population still lacks Internet access. The emergence of Low Earth orbit
Satellite Networks (LSNs), such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project
Kuiper, presents a promising solution to fill this gap. Nevertheless, our
measurement study reveals that existing live streaming platforms may not be
able to deliver a smooth viewing experience on LSNs due to frequent satellite
handovers, which lead to frequent video rebuffering events. Current
state-of-the-art learning-based Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, even when
trained on LSNs' network traces, fail to manage the abrupt network variations
associated with satellite handovers effectively. To address these challenges,
for the first time, we introduce Satellite-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA), a
versatile and lightweight middleware that can seamlessly integrate with various
ABR algorithms to enhance the performance of live streaming over LSNs. SARA
intelligently modulates video playback speed and furnishes ABR algorithms with
insights derived from the distinctive network characteristics of LSNs, thereby
aiding ABR algorithms in making informed bitrate selections and effectively
minimizing rebuffering events that occur during satellite handovers. Our
extensive evaluation shows that SARA can effectively reduce the rebuffering
time by an average of $39.41\%$ and slightly improve latency by $0.65\%$ while
only introducing an overall loss in bitrate by $0.13\%$.

Result: 原型实现显示相比最先进的DASH风格系统，延迟降低80%，吞吐量提高15-50%，缓存命中率增加20-30%。

Conclusion: INDS被证明是可变和丢包条件下实时点云流媒体的可扩展、缓存友好解决方案，且与MoQ覆盖层的兼容性使其成为新兴沉浸式媒体系统的实用、向前兼容架构。

Abstract: Real-time streaming of point cloud video, characterized by massive data
volumes and high sensitivity to packet loss, remains a key challenge for
immersive applications under dynamic network conditions. While
connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and more modern alternatives like
QUIC alleviate some transport-layer inefficiencies, including head-of-line
blocking, they still retain a coarse-grained, segment-based delivery model and
a centralized control loop that limit fine-grained adaptation and effective
caching. We introduce INDS (Incremental Named Data Streaming), an adaptive
streaming framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) that rethinks
delivery for hierarchical, layered media. INDS leverages the Octree structure
of point cloud video and expressive content naming to support progressive,
partial retrieval of enhancement layers based on consumer bandwidth and
decoding capability. By combining time-windows with Group-of-Frames (GoF),
INDS's naming scheme supports fine-grained in-network caching and facilitates
efficient multi-user data reuse. INDS can be deployed as an overlay, remaining
compatible with QUIC-based transport infrastructure as well as future
Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) architectures, without requiring changes to underlying IP
networks. Our prototype implementation shows up to 80% lower delay, 15-50%
higher throughput, and 20-30% increased cache hit rates compared to
state-of-the-art DASH-style systems. Together, these results establish INDS as
a scalable, cache-friendly solution for real-time point cloud streaming under
variable and lossy conditions, while its compatibility with MoQ overlays
further positions it as a practical, forward-compatible architecture for
emerging immersive media systems.
