For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by\ntraining models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using\nspecialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more\nefficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are\nadapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust\nfine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the\nmodel update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss\nobjective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,\nand the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust\ngeneralization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when\nexposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these\ndesign choices influence generalization remains an open question with\nsignificant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study\nspanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3\nadaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200\nrobustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this\nis the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.\nWhile attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are\nincreasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in\na supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both\nconfirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising\nresearch directions and offering practical guidance."}

Hypergraph neural\nnetworks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn\nlatent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive\ntasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit\nHypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns\nfixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end\nmanner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we\nintroduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model\nefficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node\nclassification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in\nmost settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning."}

However, the exact\ncomputation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,\nseverely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The\nchallenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as\nin Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather\nthan point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling\nhigher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class\nof GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and\ninteractions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global\nexplanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise\nexplanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components\nand compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,\ncapturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty.

Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current\nmatrix multiplication time reduction of size $\\tilde O(d/\\epsilon^2)$ for a\nbroad class of $n\\times d$ linear regression tasks.\n  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call\niterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment\nbounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya\nand van Handel, GAFA 2024]."}
