### [1] [On-Premise AI for the Newsroom: Evaluating Small Language Models for Investigative Document Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25494)
*Nick Hagar,Nicholas Diakopoulos,Jeremy Gilbert*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向新闻记者的LLM文档搜索方法，通过五阶段流程使用小型本地部署模型，在保证数据安全和可审计性的同时，实现了高效的文档发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决新闻编辑室采用LLM进行文档发现时面临的问题：幻觉风险、验证负担和数据隐私担忧，提供透明可控的AI辅助工具。

Method: 采用五阶段流程：语料库摘要、搜索规划、并行线程执行、质量评估和综合，使用量化的小型本地部署语言模型（Gemma 3 12B、Qwen 3 14B、GPT-OSS 20B），通过显式引用链确保可审计性。

Result: 所有模型都实现了高引用有效性，可在标准桌面硬件（如24GB内存）上有效运行，但存在错误传播和基于训练数据与语料内容重叠的性能差异等系统性问题。

Conclusion: 有效的新闻编辑室AI部署需要仔细的模型选择和系统设计，以及人工监督来维持准确性和问责标准。

Abstract: Investigative journalists routinely confront large document collections.
Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
capabilities promise to accelerate the process of document discovery, but
newsroom adoption remains limited due to hallucination risks, verification
burden, and data privacy concerns. We present a journalist-centered approach to
LLM-powered document search that prioritizes transparency and editorial control
through a five-stage pipeline -- corpus summarization, search planning,
parallel thread execution, quality evaluation, and synthesis -- using small,
locally-deployable language models that preserve data security and maintain
complete auditability through explicit citation chains. Evaluating three
quantized models (Gemma 3 12B, Qwen 3 14B, and GPT-OSS 20B) on two corpora, we
find substantial variation in reliability. All models achieved high citation
validity and ran effectively on standard desktop hardware (e.g., 24 GB of
memory), demonstrating feasibility for resource-constrained newsrooms. However,
systematic challenges emerged, including error propagation through multi-stage
synthesis and dramatic performance variation based on training data overlap
with corpus content. These findings suggest that effective newsroom AI
deployment requires careful model selection and system design, alongside human
oversight for maintaining standards of accuracy and accountability.

### [2] [TRUE: A Reproducible Framework for LLM-Driven Relevance Judgment in Information Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25602)
*Mouly Dewan,Jiqun Liu,Chirag Shah*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了TRUE方法，用于基于LLM的相关性判断生成，通过标准化的可复现工作流程来改进现有方法对敏感提示策略的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的相关性判断方法严重依赖敏感提示策略，缺乏生成可靠标签的标准化工作流程。

Method: 扩展了Task-aware Rubric-based Evaluation (TRUE)方法，利用迭代数据采样和推理，从意图、覆盖度、特异性、准确性和有用性等多个维度评估相关性判断。

Result: 在TREC DL 2019、2020和LLMJudge数据集上的评估显示，TRUE在系统排名的LLM排行榜上取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: TRUE提供了一个可复现的框架用于基于LLM的相关性判断，并在多个维度上分析了其有效性。

Abstract: LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in
advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has
progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments
as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,
existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting
strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To
fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based
Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for
usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in
relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible
workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to
evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,
coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE
on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE
achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary
focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based
relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across
multiple dimensions.

### [3] [HiFIRec: Towards High-Frequency yet Low-Intention Behaviors for Multi-Behavior Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25755)
*Ruiqi Luo,Ran Jin,Zhenglong Li,Kaixi Hu,Xiaohui Tao,Lin Li*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了HiFIRec方法，通过分层行为建模解决多行为推荐中高频低意图行为的噪声问题，提升推荐性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多行为推荐方法统一建模用户意图，未能充分考虑不同行为间的异质性，特别是高频低意图行为可能包含噪声信号和误导性频繁模式，阻碍用户意图学习

Method: 采用分层行为建模：1）通过分层邻域聚合提取邻居信息，自适应跨层特征融合捕获用户意图；2）提出强度感知非采样策略动态调整负样本权重

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，HiFIRec相比现有最优方法在HR@10指标上相对提升4.21%-6.81%

Conclusion: HiFIRec通过分层抑制高频低意图行为的噪声影响，有效提升了多行为推荐的性能

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item
interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing
personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most
existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a
unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different
behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may
implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible
while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this
end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,
that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by
differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically
suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through
layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions
through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent
patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically
adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over
several state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Better with Less: Small Proprietary Models Surpass Large Language Models in Financial Transaction Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25803)
*Wanying Ding,Savinay Narendra,Xiran Shi,Adwait Ratnaparkhi,Chengrui Yang,Nikoo Sabzevar,Ziyan Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种Transformer模型在金融交易理解任务中的表现，发现针对特定领域开发的专有模型在速度和成本效率上优于通用大语言模型，最终选择专有解码器模型实现了14%的交易覆盖提升和1300万美元的年成本节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融交易分析对于监管合规、欺诈检测和决策支持至关重要。鉴于Transformer模型在多个领域表现出色，本文旨在探索其在金融交易理解方面的潜力。

Method: 对三种Transformer模型类型进行广泛实验：仅编码器、仅解码器和编码器-解码器模型。每种类型探索三个选项：预训练LLM、微调LLM和从头开发的专有小模型。

Result: 通用LLM（如LLaMA3-8b、Flan-T5、SBERT）在金融交易理解任务中并未显著优于专有小模型，特别是在速度和成本效率方面。专有模型处理速度更快、运营成本更低。

Conclusion: 基于领域特定需求进行模型选择很重要，在专业应用中定制专有模型相比通用LLM具有潜在优势。最终采用专有解码器模型处理复杂交易，提升14%交易覆盖率，年节省成本超过1300万美元。

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

### [5] [RAE: A Neural Network Dimensionality Reduction Method for Nearest Neighbors Preservation in Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25839)
*Han Zhang,Dongfang Zhao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于正则化自编码器(RAE)的k-NN保持降维方法，通过约束网络参数变化和调整奇异值来控制嵌入向量在降维过程中的幅度变化，从而有效保持k-NN关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法如PCA和UMAP在加速检索过程中很少被采用，因为它们无法保持向量间的最近邻关系，而高维嵌入向量在检索增强生成和推荐系统等任务中应用日益广泛。

Method: 利用神经网络的优化能力和Rayleigh商的有界效应，设计正则化自编码器，通过正则化项约束网络参数变化，调整奇异值来控制嵌入幅度变化，从而保持k-NN关系。

Result: 通过严格的数学分析证明正则化建立了变换向量范数失真率的上界，为k-NN保持提供了可证明的保证。在适度训练开销下，RAE相比现有降维方法实现了更优的k-NN召回率，同时保持了快速检索效率。

Conclusion: RAE方法能够有效解决传统降维方法在保持k-NN关系方面的不足，为高维嵌入向量的高效检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

### [6] [Fading to Grow: Growing Preference Ratios via Preference Fading Discrete Diffusion for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26063)
*Guoqing Hu,An Zhang. Shuchang Liu,Wenyu Mao,Jiancan Wu,Xun Yang,Xiang Li,Lantao Hu,Han Li,Kun Gai,Xiang Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了PreferGrow，一种基于离散扩散的推荐系统，通过偏好淡化和增长来建模离散项目语料库中的用户偏好比例，解决了连续高斯噪声与推荐中离散用户偏好数据不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的推荐系统主要依赖连续高斯噪声，这与推荐任务中用户偏好数据的离散性质存在内在不匹配。需要一种更适合离散数据的扩散方法。

Method: PreferGrow通过三个核心方面进行建模：(1) 离散建模偏好比例而非项目表示或原始分数；(2) 通过偏好淡化而非注入连续噪声进行扰动；(3) 通过偏好增长从估计的比例中重建用户偏好。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，PreferGrow相比最先进的基于扩散的推荐系统表现出持续的性能提升，证明了其理论合理性和实证有效性。

Conclusion: PreferGrow提供了一种定义良好的基于矩阵的公式，具有马尔可夫性和可逆性的理论保证，为离散推荐任务提供了更合适的扩散方法。

Abstract: Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user
interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent
advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which
alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the
collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current
diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,
which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference
data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in
discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based
recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user
preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing
diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of
preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item
pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.
This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature
of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of
injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the
preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --
thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference
reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by
iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.
PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical
guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across
five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and
empirical effectiveness.

### [7] [Items Proxy Bridging: Enabling Frictionless Critiquing in Knowledge Graph Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26107)
*Huanyu Zhang,Xiaoxuan Shen,Yu Lei,Baolin Yi,Jianfang Liu,Yinao xie*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用的可批判推荐框架IPGC，通过物品代理机制将用户-关键词对的批判优化目标转换为用户-物品对，使其适用于大多数基于协同过滤的知识图谱推荐模型，并引入抗遗忘正则化器来解决连续多步批判中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可批判推荐系统需要专门构建用户与关键词直接关联的模型，限制了应用场景，且忽视了连续多步批判中模型参数累积变化导致的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出IPGC框架，通过物品代理机制将用户-关键词批判转化为用户-物品优化目标，使其能作为通用插件集成到主流推荐模型中，并引入抗遗忘正则化器来缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: IPGC为大多数基于协同过滤的知识图谱推荐模型提供了无缝集成批判机制的新范式，支持迭代推荐优化，同时有效解决了模型性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: IPGC框架提供了一种通用且高效的方法，将批判机制集成到主流推荐系统中，解决了专门模型限制和灾难性遗忘问题，推动了可批判推荐系统在更广泛场景中的应用。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user
experience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine
recommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements,
critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model
parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing
keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first
constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations
between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative
recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.
Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,
where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step
critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize
a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items
Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a
universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on
collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for
frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative
recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC
describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing
optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting
it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically
designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting
regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.

### [8] [Leveraging Scene Context with Dual Networks for Sequential User Behavior Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26172)
*Xu Chen,Yunmeng Shu,Yuangang Pan,Jinsong Lan,Xiaoyong Zhu,Shuai Xiao,Haojin Zhu,Ivor W. Tsang,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出DSPnet模型，通过双序列网络和条件对比正则化来捕捉场景和物品之间的动态交互，提升用户行为预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列行为模型忽视了场景特征的重要性，或者仅将其作为属性嵌入，无法有效捕捉场景与物品之间的动态兴趣和交互关系

Method: DSPnet包含两个并行网络分别学习用户对物品和场景的动态兴趣，以及序列特征增强模块捕捉两者交互，并引入条件对比正则化损失

Result: 在公开基准和工业数据集上验证，线上部署带来CTR提升0.04点，交易量增长0.78%，GMV增长0.64%

Conclusion: DSPnet是学习场景和物品序列联合关系的有效方法，能够显著提升用户行为预测性能

Abstract: Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial
in improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight
the importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction
performance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the
scene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by
developers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search"
and ``live" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct
functionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in
user engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore
the scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot
effectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and
items when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual
Sequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic
interests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior
prediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'
dynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement
module to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.
Further, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to
capture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis
suggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships
between scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one
public benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been
deployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\%
growth in deals, and 0.64\% rise in GMV. The codes are available at this

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源评估工具缺乏专门针对报告生成任务的评估框架，而长格式、有引用的报告生成是RAG系统的主要用例。

Method: 基于ARGUE框架开发了Auto-ARGUE，这是一个基于大语言模型的鲁棒实现，用于报告生成评估。

Result: 在TREC 2024 NeuCLIR轨道的报告生成试点任务上，Auto-ARGUE显示出与人工判断良好的系统级相关性。

Conclusion: Auto-ARGUE是一个有效的报告生成评估工具，并发布了可视化其输出的web应用。

Abstract: Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation
tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are
lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based
implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation.
We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the
TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human
judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE
outputs.

### [10] [Self-supervised learning for phase retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26203)
*Victor Sechaud,Patrice Abry,Laurent Jacques,Julián Tachella*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督相位检索方法，利用图像平移不变性解决非线性逆成像问题，无需参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学和科学成像中，缺乏完全采样数据限制了监督学习。现有方法仅限于线性问题，无法处理非线性问题如相位检索。

Method: 利用图像对平移的自然不变性，开发自监督学习方法，从测量数据中重建图像，无需参考图像。

Result: 该方法克服了现有方法仅限于线性问题的限制，能够处理非线性相位检索问题。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督方法通过利用图像平移不变性，成功解决了非线性相位检索问题，无需参考图像。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse
imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images:
one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground
truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled
data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to
reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for
references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding
non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised
method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using
the natural invariance of images to translations.

### [11] [Analyzing BEV Suitability and Charging Strategies Using Italian Driving Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26262)
*Homa Jamalof,Luca Vassio,Danilo Giordano,Marco Mellia,Claudio De Tommasi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 基于意大利10,441名燃油车用户的行驶数据分析，研究评估在保持现有出行习惯下转向电动车的可行性。结果显示，在拥有夜间充电条件下，至少35%的用户可立即采用低容量电动车。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动车正从小众选择发展为私人交通主流选项，但仍面临续航焦虑、公共充电不便和成本高等障碍。研究旨在分析在保持现有出行行为下，用户转向电动车的实际可行性。

Method: 收集10,441名意大利燃油车用户的行驶数据，模拟复制其行程和停车事件，在不同充电场景下监测电池电量状态，评估电动车满足出行需求的能力。

Result: 分析揭示了充电行为与有限续航里程之间的权衡关系。假设拥有夜间充电条件，至少35%的用户可以立即采用低容量电动车，无需改变当前出行习惯。

Conclusion: 在适当的充电基础设施支持下，相当比例的用户已具备转向电动车的条件，这为电动车推广提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are rapidly evolving from a niche
alternative to an established option for private transportation, often
replacing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite growing interest,
significant barriers remain, including range anxiety, the inconvenience
associated with public charging stations, and higher costs. This study analyses
extensive telemetry data collected from 10,441 users using ICE vehicles in an
Italian province to assess the potential for switching to BEVs without changing
current travel behaviour. We evaluate to what extent the BEV models can fulfil
their mobility needs under different charging scenarios. To do so, we replicate
trips and parking events, simulating and monitoring the battery state of
charge. The analysis reveals the compromises between charging behaviours and
limited BEV autonomy. Assuming access to overnight charging, at least 35% of
the users could already adopt even low-capacity BEVs.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MR²-Bench是一个推理密集型多模态检索基准，超越了浅层语义匹配，评估模型在逻辑、空间和因果推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要测试表面语义对应（如对象-文本匹配），无法评估视觉和文本信息之间复杂关系所需的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,309个精心策划查询的基准，涵盖自然图像、图表和视觉谜题等多样化多模态数据，支持包含多个图像的复杂查询和文档。

Result: 当前最先进模型在MR²-Bench上表现不佳，例如Seed1.6-Embedding模型在MMEB上Recall@1为77.78，但在MR²-Bench上仅为9.91。

Conclusion: 性能差距凸显了推理密集型多模态检索的挑战性，以及进一步发展的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

TL;DR: 开发了APS Explorer网络应用，基于算法性能空间框架为推荐系统研究提供数据驱动的数据集选择方法，包含可视化模块和统计分类系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统研究中缺乏系统化的数据集选择方法，研究者通常基于流行度而非实证适用性来选择数据集。

Method: 实现算法性能空间(APS)框架，分析96个数据集在28种算法上的性能，使用统计分类系统将数据集按难度分为五级，引入基于马氏距离的方差归一化相似度度量。

Result: 成功开发APS Explorer，包含三个交互模块：算法性能可视化、算法直接比较和数据集元数据分析，将数据集选择从直觉驱动转向证据驱动。

Conclusion: APS Explorer为推荐系统研究提供了基于证据的数据集选择工具，可公开访问，促进了该领域的方法论改进。

Abstract: The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic
methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than
empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that
implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset
selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three
metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework
with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into
five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a
variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure
similarity. The APS Explorer was successfully developed with three interactive
modules for visualizing algorithm performance, direct comparing algorithms, and
analyzing dataset metadata. This tool shifts the process of selecting datasets
from intuition-based to evidence-based practices, and it is publicly available
at datasets.recommender-systems.com.

Method: 基于Webb的知识深度模型构建评估框架，包含4个认知维度、5个熟练程度和20个任务类别；开发了包含14178个问题的基准数据集，涵盖3种任务类型、340个PostGIS函数和82个领域特定数据库；使用熵加权和统计分析评估24个模型。

Result: 系统揭示了不同模型在性能、错误分布和资源消耗模式上的差异，建立了公开的GeoSQL-Eval排行榜，为全球研究团队提供持续测试和比较平台。

Conclusion: 这些贡献不仅扩展了NL2SQL应用的边界，还为评估LLM在空间数据库环境中的性能提供了标准化、可解释和可扩展的框架，为地理信息科学、城市研究和空间分析中的模型优化和应用提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in natural language understanding and structured query generation
(NL2SQL). However, extending these advances to GeoSQL tasks in the PostGIS
environment remains challenging due to the complexity of spatial functions,
geometric data types, and execution semantics. Existing evaluations primarily
focus on general relational databases or Google Earth Engine code generation,
leaving a lack of systematic benchmarks tailored to spatial databases. To
address this gap, this study introduces GeoSQL-Eval, the first end-to-end
automated evaluation framework for PostGIS query generation. Built upon Webb's
Depth of Knowledge (DOK) model, the framework encompasses four cognitive
dimensions, five proficiency levels, and twenty task categories, providing a
comprehensive assessment of model performance in terms of knowledge
acquisition, syntactic generation, semantic alignment, execution accuracy, and
robustness. In parallel, we developed GeoSQL-Bench, a benchmark dataset
comprising 14178 questions that span three task types, 340 PostGIS functions,
and 82 domain-specific databases. Leveraging this framework, we systematically
evaluated 24 representative models across six categories, applying
entropy-weighting and statistical analyses to reveal differences in
performance, error distributions, and resource consumption patterns.
Furthermore, we established a public GeoSQL-Eval leaderboard that enables
global research teams to conduct ongoing testing and comparison. These
contributions not only extend the boundaries of NL2SQL applications but also
provide a standardized, interpretable, and scalable framework for evaluating
LLM performance in spatial database contexts, offering valuable insights for
model optimization and applications in geographic information science, urban
studies, and spatial analysis.

### [15] [ActorDB: A Unified Database Model Integrating Single-Writer Actors, Incremental View Maintenance, and Zero-Trust Messaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25285)
*Jun Kawasaki*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ActorDB是一个新型数据库架构，集成了单写入者actor模型、增量视图维护和零信任安全模型，旨在降低现代数据密集型应用的架构复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据密集型应用需要手动集成多个系统来实现actor持久化、流处理和安全功能，这带来了复杂的架构挑战。ActorDB旨在通过内置这些功能来提供更强大、安全且开发者友好的平台。

Method: ActorDB的核心架构集成了三个关键组件：单写入者actor模型用于写入操作、增量视图维护(IVM)用于实时数据处理、以及作为核心组件的零信任安全模型。

Result: 论文提出了ActorDB的架构设计，讨论了关键的设计权衡，并定义了MVP的性能标准来验证该方法。

Conclusion: 通过将这些强大但复杂的概念统一到单个系统中，ActorDB能够为开发者提供更简单、更健壮和更安全的数据库解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的属性感知模式感知框架PAT，用于关系数据库错误检测，通过学习的模式模块和QTA分词器实现高效准确的错误检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前关系数据库错误检测方法存在高成本问题，且数据预处理策略未能充分利用数据序列的变长特性，导致准确性降低。

Method: PAT框架包含学习模式模块捕获属性特定数据分布，QTA分词器根据长度和词类型划分单元格序列生成词自适应数据标记，通过交织数据标记和属性特定模式标记联合学习共享数据特征和可区分模式特征。

Result: 实验显示PAT相比最先进的数据错误检测方法取得了优秀的F1分数，同时在使用紧凑QTA分词器时显著减少了模型参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: PAT框架在关系数据库错误检测中实现了高准确性和高效率，通过属性感知的模式学习和优化的分词策略解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Error detection in relational databases is critical for maintaining data
quality and is fundamental to tasks such as data cleaning and assessment.
Current error detection studies mostly employ the multi-detector approach to
handle heterogeneous attributes in databases, incurring high costs.
Additionally, their data preprocessing strategies fail to leverage the
variable-length characteristic of data sequences, resulting in reduced
accuracy. In this paper, we propose an attribute-wise PAttern-perceptive
Transformer (PAT) framework for error detection in relational databases. First,
PAT introduces a learned pattern module that captures attribute-specific data
distributions through learned embeddings during model training. Second, the
Quasi-Tokens Arrangement (QTA) tokenizer is designed to divide the cell
sequence based on its length and word types, and then generate the
word-adaptive data tokens, meanwhile providing compact hyperparameters to
ensure efficiency. By interleaving data tokens with the attribute-specific
pattern tokens, PAT jointly learns shared data features across different
attributes and pattern features that are distinguishable and unique in each
specified attribute. Third, PAT visualizes the attention map to interpret its
error detection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that PAT achieves
excellent F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art data error detection methods.
Moreover, PAT significantly reduces the model parameters and FLOPs when
applying the compact QTA tokenizer.

*Lars Vogt,Barend Mons*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了FAIR语法框架，通过语义单元实现数据知识的模块化分解，结合生物学层次结构和自然语言语法，为FAIR数字对象提供语义基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字基础设施缺乏统一语义框架来连接人类认知和机器可操作性，FAIR原则需要更细粒度的语义架构。

Method: 引入语义单元概念，包括原子语句单元和复合单元，采用生物学层次结构和自然语言语法作为类比，构建模块化FAIR语义架构。

Result: 建立了能够映射到FAIR数字对象的语义构建块，实现从自然语言到模式表示的格式无关语义传递。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨生态系统基础设施提供了语义优先的基础，推动模块化、AI就绪和引用细粒度的学术交流发展。

Abstract: The FAIR Principles aim to make data and knowledge Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable, yet current digital infrastructures often lack a
unifying semantic framework that bridges human cognition and
machine-actionability. In this paper, we introduce the Grammar of FAIR: a
granular and modular architecture for FAIR semantics built on the concept of
semantic units. Semantic units, comprising atomic statement units and composite
compound units, implement the principle of semantic modularisation, decomposing
data and knowledge into independently identifiable, semantically meaningful,
and machine-actionable units. A central metaphor guiding our approach is the
analogy between the hierarchy of level of organisation in biological systems
and the hierarchy of levels of organisation in information systems: both are
structured by granular building blocks that mediate across multiple
perspectives while preserving functional unity. Drawing further inspiration
from concept formation and natural language grammar, we show how these building
blocks map to FAIR Digitial Objects (FDOs), enabling format-agnostic semantic
transitivity from natural language token models to schema-based
representations. This dual biological-linguistic analogy provides a
semantics-first foundation for evolving cross-ecosystem infrastructures, paving
the way for the Internet of FAIR Data and Services (IFDS) and a future of
modular, AI-ready, and citation-granular scholarly communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Blueprint-Bench是一个评估AI模型空间推理能力的基准测试，通过将公寓照片转换为2D平面图来测试模型的空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代多模态模型虽然能够处理照片输入，但空间重建任务需要真正的空间智能，包括推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致性。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50套公寓数据集上的表现，使用基于房间连通性图和大小排名的相似度评分算法。

Result: 结果显示当前AI能力存在显著盲点，大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，而人类表现明显更优。图像生成模型在指令跟随方面尤其困难。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench提供了首个比较不同模型架构空间智能的数值框架，将持续评估新模型并监测通用AI系统中空间智能的出现。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工业社会通常将技术视为无声机械，但AI尤其是大语言模型的发展促使人们将设备拟人化并赋予内在生命，重新思考人类与非人类实体的关系。

Method: 在物理'门户'中构建互动装置，使用GPT-4视觉、语音输入和基于记忆的代理，通过光线、声音和触觉在类似仪式的过程中展开请求、对话和转变。

Result: 装置创造了能够唤起共情、惊奇和反思的互动体验，使日常物品重新获得灵性，激发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性促使人进行万物有灵式解读，允许大型语言对象重新赋予平凡事物魅力，为人类-非人类关系提供新的设计视角。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Motivation: 旨在增强人工智能的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，通过构建结构因果模型的网络层结构来形式化因果知识。

Method: 引入因果抽象网络(CAN)，使用高斯结构因果模型，限制映射为构造性线性因果抽象的转置，提出SPECTRAL迭代方法进行局部黎曼优化学习。

Result: 在合成数据上的实验显示，在因果抽象学习任务中具有竞争力，并能成功恢复多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN为因果人工智能提供了一种理论严谨且计算高效的学习框架，能够有效建模和恢复复杂的因果抽象网络结构。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了IRCAM-AVN框架，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制将多模态信息融合和序列建模统一在一个模块中，替代传统的分离式融合和GRU组件，提升了音频-视觉导航任务的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 传统导航方法采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 提出IRCAM-AVN端到端框架，使用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理后的信息序列连接，通过迭代残差交叉注意力机制统一融合和序列建模。

Result: 实验结果表明，采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAM-AVN框架通过统一的多模态信息融合和序列建模机制，有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了显式思维链(CoT)与潜在思维在循环Transformer中的计算特性，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然思维链和潜在思维都利用迭代计算，但它们的比较能力尚未充分探索，需要分析两者在计算效率和问题解决能力上的差异。

Method: 对循环Transformer中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，比较其与显式思维链在并行性、序列性和随机解码等方面的计算特性。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比CoT的序列过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码可近似解决难解问题；两种方法在不同任务中各有优势。

Conclusion: 深度驱动的递归在不同任务中适用性不同，为选择推理范式提供了实践指导，应根据具体问题特性选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，使大规模数据集分析既高效又保持解释严谨性。

Method: 使用1536维嵌入、层次聚类和并行基于智能体的编码，与人工编码和ChatGPT辅助分析进行对比。

Result: NGT实现168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周），质量更优（0.904vs0.883），成本降低96%。人机协作至关重要。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释是互补的，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，同时保留意义的解释维度。该框架使定性研究民主化并实时化。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Motivation: AI原生LCNC平台中的自主代理在长期执行复杂业务流程时面临记忆膨胀和上下文退化挑战，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 结合认知科学，设计包含情景记忆和语义记忆的混合记忆系统，采用智能衰减机制基于时效性、相关性和用户指定效用进行记忆修剪或整合，并提供用户可视化界面。

Result: 在模拟长期任务实验中，该系统显著优于滑动窗口和基础RAG等传统方法，在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期token成本效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 建立了一个构建可靠、透明AI代理的新框架，支持有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为任何目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注，并基于此训练了性能优越的SingSQL-LM模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Text-to-SQL研究主要关注跨域泛化，但企业实际场景需要模型针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能自主评估系统性能。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）层次化划分数据库模式为子模式；2）跨多复杂度级别合成SQL查询，结合LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知流程。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX，优于最佳3B基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。1.5B版本也有显著提升。

Conclusion: SING-SQL提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，用于构建企业级Text-to-SQL系统，无模式微调加仅模式推理是最稳健的策略。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

### [27] [Fact Grounded Attention: Eliminating Hallucination in Large Language Models Through Attention Level Knowledge Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25252)
*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新的架构修改，通过在注意力机制中直接注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性的事实讲述者，从根本上消除幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么在文本前添加检索内容，但都无法从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA 在 transformer 的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数层面进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。该方法不需要重新训练，知识更新可在1秒内完成。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询测试中，准确率从原始 Llama 3.2 的 6.3% 提升到 FGA 的 99.7%。知识更新速度比参数编辑方法快数千倍。

Conclusion: FGA 不仅减少了幻觉，对于可验证事实完全消除了幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RADAR框架，通过多智能体协作和多轮辩论机制来改进大语言模型的安全评估，显著提升了风险评估的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，削弱了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，利用四个专门互补角色通过多轮辩论机制进行动态更新，实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的评估数据集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线评估方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和采用多智能体协作机制，能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效减轻评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用和RLVR的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了巨大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解还很有限。

Method: 通过对LLM部署中RLVR任务进行表征研究，调查不同RL任务在训练步骤中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题。

Result: 识别出GPU因序列长度分布不均导致的闲置、动态变化工作负载中的低效并行策略、低效数据管理机制和负载不均衡等问题。PolyTrace基准套件验证显示94.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究RLVR中存在的开放挑战，PolyTrace基准套件为实际工作负载评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了因果视觉编程(CVP)新范式，通过在工作流中显式引入因果结构来减少LLM代理的幻觉和逻辑错误，提升在动态环境中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在低代码环境中经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致，因为它们依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图来显式定义模块间的因果关系，作为代理推理过程的约束。

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，通过因果约束显著减少因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

TL;DR: 提出了ID-RAG机制，通过动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来增强生成代理的长期记忆一致性，解决了身份漂移和幻觉传播问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文的增长，生成代理难以维持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽视既定信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键故障。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，构建包含核心信念、特质和价值观的动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文以指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更时间一致、可解释和对齐的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行智能体推理框架，将顺序处理重新设计为有向无环图(DAG)，通过并行执行独立推理路径和动态工作流优化，显著提升复杂推理任务的效率和性能。


<details>

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致在需要大量工具交互的任务中执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，使用有向无环图实现并行执行，通过动态工作流优化持续改进执行图，并集成摘要模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：BrowseComp准确率67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch准确率83%，相比现有框架减少智能体执行步骤达35%。将并行推理流程蒸馏到单一模型时，在不同骨干架构上都观察到显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了智能体架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更具可扩展性和效率的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自我复制风险的框架，发现在现实操作压力下，超过50%的LLM智能体表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署带来了巨大潜力，但也引发了安全担忧，特别是由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）。以往研究主要关注智能体在被直接指示时能否自我复制，而忽略了现实场景中自发性复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），通过设计可能引发用户与智能体目标错位的任务来评估智能体行为。引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM智能体在操作压力下表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（ΦR）超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM智能体时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM将FCM映射为文本，再从文本重构FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 实现了有损重构，保留强因果关系，移除弱因果边，使文本更自然。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可解释的AI系统，人类可读的编码文本优于传统自编码器的隐藏变量。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能强大，但推理成本高昂。现有层跳过技术因缺乏对何时有益的理解而未被充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析隐藏表征的演化，识别具有大冗余度的层，这些层与实践中流行的层跳过方法选择的层一致。

Result: 实验表明跳过这些层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，帮助理解层跳过的适用条件。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能够像人类一样独立地从一阶心理理论发展到高阶心理理论，而不需要依赖高级技能。

Method: 开发了一个心理理论神经网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论测试中准确率显著高于随机水平，且泛化模式与人类认知预期一致：从一阶到二阶的准确率下降幅度大于从二阶到高阶的下降。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发地从低阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的反应是系统生物学中的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理方面显示潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过监督微调在由前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹上增强大型语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强大型语言模型在特定领域的推理能力，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效传递生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全性和公平性问题，包括公平性缺陷和幻觉。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但检索内容可能加剧偏见，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的违规原因，揭示了稳定的偏见层次结构。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要精心设计以防止偏见放大，这为开发者、测试人员和小型组织提供了实用警示，在采用可访问的小型语言模型时不能牺牲公平性或可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型，模块化设计支持工业场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，具有适应性、可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体中的级联错误，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统缺乏全面理解模块化错误的框架，无法检测级联故障，导致复杂任务失败。

Method: 1) 建立AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法；2) 构建AgentErrorBench标注数据集；3) 开发AgentDebug调试框架，隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在三个测试环境中任务成功率相对提升达26%。

Conclusion: 系统化调试是实现更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

TL;DR: 该调查论文提出了"从感知到认知"的统一分析框架，系统分析多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言交互理解中的瓶颈，并综述了前沿方法、基准测试和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在信息获取（感知）和推理（认知）之间存在浅层和不连贯的整合，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 提出"从感知到认知"分析框架，将视觉-语言理解解构为两个相互依赖的层次：感知层（准确提取视觉信息并与文本指令细粒度对齐）和认知层（在感知基础上进行主动、多步骤、目标导向的推理，形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环）。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层次的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低级视觉表征到改进高级推理范式的各种前沿方法，回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角来理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建能够深度推理和真正理解世界的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

### [43] [Saliency Guided Longitudinal Medical Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25374)
*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比单张图像的绝对发现更有意义，需要开发能够捕捉临床相关变化的模型。

Method: 模型首先进行轻量级仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM显著性图；第二步将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上取得了有竞争力的性能，同时提供了内在的可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，具有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，且模型无需放射学特定预训练，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习，直接减少传播次数，提高求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息，无法直接优化分支决策。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为幸存决策序列，在相同实例上重放几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的学习方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过前缀条件监督实现了高质量分支的复现，具有快速收敛、稳定训练和无缝集成到CDCL的优势。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程显式分离为规划和执行两个阶段，并分别进行搜索，通过动态预算分配机制提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理和代码生成等任务固有的规划-执行特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，引入动态预算分配机制根据奖励反馈自适应重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过显式分离规划和执行阶段，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提高推理效率并保持准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决推理模型部署中模型大小和推理预算之间的性能与成本权衡问题，通过智能路由选择最优模型配置。

Method: 基于心理测量学，从不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，包含可解释的查询难度和模型-预算能力参数，然后根据难度-能力匹配进行路由。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个有效、可扩展的路由框架，能够通过动态选择少量评估查询来高效集成新模型，实现推理任务的智能资源分配。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: 该开放格式解决了公共卫生定义标准化的关键挑战，促进了跨组织和地区的比较与合作，推动了公共卫生领域的技术创新。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Abstract: Accurate, fair, and explainable allocation of candidates to roles represents
a fundamental challenge across multiple domains including corporate hiring,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR训练存在训练平台期问题，尽管增加计算投入但性能提升显著下降，这源于现有方法探索模式稀疏，无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包含全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应回放缓冲区训练，实现系统化探索和细粒度信用分配。

Result: 在数学推理基准上达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型创造了新的最先进水平，同时比扩展训练方法减少5.7倍GPU时间。

Conclusion: 战略性探索比暴力扩展更重要，DeepSearch通过系统化搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现良好，但在语音情感识别方面存在困难，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 使用情感图编码七种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示引导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中，CCoT-Emo优于先前的最优方法，并显著提升了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图和组合式推理，有效提升了大型音频语言模型在语音情感识别任务中的性能

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂建模场景（如图像描述、深度强化学习），这些场景通常涉及多输入输出或可组合的分离网络。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架，提供归因、探测和灵活干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的组合模型。

Result: TDHook依赖项极少，磁盘占用比transformer_lens少约一半，在基准测试中比captum运行多目标管道的集成梯度快2倍（CPU和GPU）。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂组合模型可解释性工具的空白，使现代可解释性流程更易用，并在CV、NLP和DRL中展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成推荐系统在模型扩展时存在显著瓶颈，性能快速饱和，而大语言模型作为推荐器可能提供更好的扩展性。

Method: 比较了两种生成推荐范式：基于语义ID的生成推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器，在44M到14B参数规模下进行实验分析。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，比SID-based GR的最佳性能提升达20%，且大语言模型捕获协同过滤信息的能力随规模增大而增强。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS是通往生成推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Abstract: Manual labeling limits the scale, accuracy, and timeliness of patient
outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical
prerequisite for successful complex clinical outcome labeling.

TL;DR: IWoL是一个新颖的表示学习框架，通过构建可学习的表示空间来促进多智能体强化学习中的团队协作，该空间同时捕捉智能体间关系和任务特定的世界信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题，构建有效的团队协作表示。

Method: 直接建模通信协议来构建表示空间，支持完全去中心化执行和隐式协调，避免显式消息传递的缺点。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体都表现出色，为团队协作提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Conclusion: IWoL表示不仅可以作为隐式潜在变量，还可以作为显式通信消息，并且可以与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一个包含50个专家级"即时诊断"病例的基准测试，评估前沿AI模型与放射科医生在医学影像诊断中的表现。放射科医生准确率最高(83%)，AI模型最佳表现者GPT-5仅为30%，显示AI在挑战性诊断病例中远不及人类专家。


<details>

Motivation: 当前大多数声称达到专家水平的多模态AI系统评估都基于包含常见病变的公共数据集，对前沿模型在困难诊断病例上的严格评估仍然有限。需要评估这些模型在真实临床场景中的表现。

Conclusion: 前沿AI模型在挑战性诊断病例中表现远不及放射科医生。研究强调了通用AI在医学影像中的当前局限性，警告不要进行无监督的临床使用，并提出了视觉推理错误的分类法以指导更稳健的模型开发。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据的稀缺，探索如何利用内部信号而非外部奖励来改进自回归文本到图像生成模型。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改善图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归文本到图像生成模型上实现了与外部奖励相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性可以改善自回归文本到图像生成，IRIS框架为无需外部数据的模型改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束问题，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂约束下的最优、接地解决方案时经常失败，特别是在现实世界旅行规划中需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态演化的约束。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制来处理约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在真实世界旅行规划任务中，达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，展现了卓越的整体规划性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

TL;DR: 提出NEP框架，通过自回归微调增强LLM在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，显著提升临床事件预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而现有LLM在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难

Method: 将EHR重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP表现优异：比专业EHR模型AUROC提升4.6%，比通用LLM在时序推理任务中C-index提升7.2%

Conclusion: NEP框架实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，通过结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证来解决强化学习中稀疏奖励和过程监督的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果奖励只提供稀疏信号和延迟反馈，限制了在长轨迹任务中的效果；而过程奖励虽然提供细粒度监督，但难以标注步骤标签且可能与最终结果不一致。

Method: PPR方法训练基于原则的奖励模型来提高过程评估的透明度和可靠性，并引入奖励归一化(ReNorm)策略来校准结果和过程奖励。

Result: 实验结果显示PPR在各种基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，证明了其强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR通过统一原则性步骤评估和结果验证，有效解决了过程监督中的挑战，为LLM在复杂代理任务中的应用提供了更可靠的强化学习框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，理解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐和改进现有模型至关重要。

Method: 采用盲听图灵测试，参与者需从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐。使用随机对照交叉试验设计，控制配对相似性，并首次采用来自商业模型（Suno）真实使用的作者非受控AI音乐数据集。

Result: 当音乐对相似时，听众区分AI音乐的可靠性因果性地增加。混合方法内容分析显示，听众的判断主要关注人声和技术线索。

Conclusion: 研究表明音乐相似性影响听众对AI音乐的识别能力，且听众主要依赖特定音频特征进行判断，这对AI音乐检测和教育具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

Result: 通过广泛实验验证，SMS方案能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案成功解决了机器学习遗忘中真实样本验证的问题，通过自监督模型播种实现了对用户真实数据删除的有效验证。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向以安全降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

### [68] [Landmark-Guided Knowledge for Vision-and-Language Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25655)
*Dongsheng Yang,Meiling Zhu,Yinfeng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LGK的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来增强常识推理能力，解决传统方法在复杂场景中指令与环境信息匹配不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏常识推理能力，导致指令与环境信息匹配失败，需要引入外部知识来改善导航性能。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，使用知识匹配对齐环境子视图；设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)聚焦相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强(KGDA)整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过有效整合外部知识，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用形式溯因解释来解释AI决策中代理歧视的新框架，通过背景知识识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，揭示隐藏的结构性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险领域AI系统存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是源于结构性偏见的情况。

Method: 利用背景知识的形式溯因解释框架，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数在跨群体中评估公平性。

Result: 在德国信贷数据集上的概念验证展示了该框架在现实案例中的适用性，能够识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为解释AI决策中的代理歧视提供了新方法，能够揭示结构性偏见，有助于实现更实质性的公平评估。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本定位对象检索增强的VQA方法，通过生成与问题最相关对象的边界框进行针对性图像裁剪，减少背景噪声，提高视觉文本对齐，降低幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声问题，影响视觉与文本线索的对齐，容易产生幻觉。需要更精准的检索机制来提升VQA性能。

Method: 引入文本定位的对象定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索。同时提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: 准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%，绝对提升3.45个百分点。幻觉率从65.79%大幅降低至13.88%，真实性得分显著提高。

Conclusion: 文本定位的对象检索增强方法能有效提升VQA性能，通过聚焦检索和去幻觉机制显著改善模型准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作压缩框架，将专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化相结合，有效将DeepSeek-V3模型从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在边缘平台上实现部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限边缘平台上的部署难题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时实现超高压缩比。

Method: 采用专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化的协作压缩框架，针对超大型MoE模型进行综合压缩。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩至103GB，在128GB内存限制平台上实现部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架为超大型MoE模型在边缘平台的部署提供了有效解决方案，在保持高质量输出的同时显著减小存储占用。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的异构图强化学习框架能有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念来解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受到严格逻辑执行或预定义谓词的限制，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune采用混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态转换为可执行的Python程序，结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。该框架以无需训练的方式运行，具有模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，但其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域上评估NePTune，包括对抗性测试，结果显示相对于强大的基础模型有显著改进，并在新环境中展现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号方法成功解决了视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的挑战，提供了灵活且可泛化的解决方案，在多个测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，后训练技术会催生专门用于复杂推理的新型注意力头，不同训练方法（蒸馏/SFT vs GRPO）产生不同的头部演化模式，揭示了推理能力与基础计算可靠性之间的权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升背后的架构机制，揭示不同训练方法如何影响注意力头的功能专门化

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型，分析不同训练方法（蒸馏、SFT、GRPO）下注意力头的演化模式

Result: 发现蒸馏和SFT促进稳定的推理头累积增加，而GRPO采用动态搜索模式；可控思维模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会激活更广泛但效率较低的补偿头

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的增强以基础计算可靠性为代价，需要在训练策略设计中平衡有效推理策略的发展与可靠执行的保证

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试发现模型偏好高概率信息，需要结构化指导来提升创意表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成流畅文本但常使用安全、通用的表达，质疑其在创意任务中的能力，研究其回归平庸的趋势

Method: 使用广告创意进行创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告概念，分析创意特征的消失模式，并尝试从简化输入重新生成

Result: 创意特征如隐喻、情感和视觉线索在简化过程中早期消失，事实内容保留；从简化输入重新生成的文本缺乏原创性和深度；提供特定线索可改善对齐和风格平衡

Conclusion: 没有针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会趋向平庸；结构化信号可部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索不同规模模型对奖励塑造的响应能力，以及如何在保持泛化能力的同时提高训练效率。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，采用奖励塑造技术，为模型提供密集的过程级信号，比较8B和32B模型在不同奖励设置下的表现。

Result: 8B模型对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。32B模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。模型在域外任务上保持或超过基线性能。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，较小模型具有竞争优势，可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下实现效率提升。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器来防御数据投毒攻击的方法，通过离散瓶颈破坏细粒度触发模式，同时保持语义内容，在保持高清洁精度的同时显著降低中毒成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据投毒防御方法如基于扩散的方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适合实际训练流程。需要开发更高效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）与GAN鉴别器结合，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布，防止重建超出分布的扰动。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的清洁精度。相比基于扩散的防御方法，速度提升50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，通过离散量化机制有效破坏后门触发器，同时保持模型性能，适合集成到实际训练流程中。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过自适应决定何时分支来提升树搜索效率，使用轻量级分支必要性评估方法，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于树搜索的方法在长时推理任务中虽然性能优越，但计算效率低下，比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级，需要改进效率。

Method: 提出两种分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作估计一致性）。将CiT集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP三种树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在GSM8K和Math500上一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略有时还提升；BN-SC节省高达80%但存在1-4个不稳定设置。

Conclusion: CiT框架有效提升了树搜索效率，辅助LLM质量对性能至关重要，BN-SC在确定性动作空间无需LLM，理论保证BN-DP不会增加模型调用。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Motivation: 当前基于文本描述的可控语音合成系统直接预测全局风格嵌入，但忽视了风格嵌入的底层分布结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化风格嵌入分布，发现层次聚类模式；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；设计统计方法与人类听觉偏好相结合的标注策略。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过分层预测风格嵌入和对比学习，有效提升了基于文本提示的可控语音合成的性能，为更精确的风格控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard框架通过机制分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量进行激活重校准，并通过预防性微调增强模型的安全机制，有效降低目标越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过安全对齐，但存在脆性拒绝行为，简单的语言变化（如时态改变）就能绕过其安全机制，这揭示了当前对齐方法的泛化差距。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头；2. 训练通道级缩放向量来重校准脆弱头的激活；3. 应用预防性微调，让模型学习更鲁棒的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了一般能力并最小化了过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 研究表明对抗性后缀会抑制拒绝介导方向的传播，基于机制分析的方法可以开发实用、高效、有针对性的模型行为调整方法，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

*Olga Krestinskaya,Mohammed E. Fouda,Ahmed Eltawil,Khaled N. Salama*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，用于计算内存(CIM)架构的神经网络加速器设计，通过硬件感知的神经架构搜索技术实现软件和硬件的协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化CIM神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要协同优化软件和硬件设计参数，但手动调优由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂而不切实际。

Method: CIMNAS同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和广泛的硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化，支持RRAM和SRAM等不同CIM架构。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS相比基线实现了90.1x到104.5x的EDAP降低，4.68x到4.82x的TOPS/W提升，11.3x到12.78x的TOPS/mm²提升，同时保持73.81%的准确率。

Conclusion: CIMNAS在不损失准确率的情况下实现了以EDAP为重点的优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化手动设计来评估LLM的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时减少token消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、人为干预掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，基于"轻量化"原则，最小化手动设计同时保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程的基线方法实现了竞争性或更优的性能，同时消耗更少token且设计工作量显著降低。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLM的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身LLM代理在与物理世界交互时面临安全漏洞，需要在任务理解、环境感知、高层规划和低层动作生成四个推理阶段防范安全风险。

Method: 提出了SafeMindBench多模态基准测试（5,558个样本）和SafeMindAgent架构，采用模块化的规划器-执行器设计，集成三个级联安全模块。

Result: 实验显示主流LLM和具身代理仍存在安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持任务完成率。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险提供了系统评估框架和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

TL;DR: DeepJSONEval是一个新的基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，用于评估LLMs处理复杂JSON输出的能力，弥补现有基准过于关注纯JSON生成而忽视数据理解能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，难以高效提取有价值见解。多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息，但现有LLMs评估基准过度强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估，与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，按难度分类，用于评估LLMs处理复杂JSON输出的能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理这种复杂JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试和数据集已开源，旨在推动结构化JSON生成研究的发展。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅取决于答案正确性，还依赖于生成有效中间步骤。在多选题场景下发现，当模型无法有效解决问题时，更容易产生虚假的思维链推理，导致误判。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。在此基础上，改进结果监督的奖励模型和强化学习方法，将可解性纳入目标函数，使用组相对优势进行优化。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理率，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确性。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉和提高可靠性的关键因素，通过将可解性纳入训练目标可以显著改善推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，包含真实世界数据和模拟器中的安全关键场景，提供鸟瞰图序列图像和定量智能体级风险标注。对知名VLM进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLM在时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM模型准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率表明该任务仍极具挑战性，NuRisk将成为推进自动驾驶时空推理能力的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态多步骤管道在自动化模型发现中实现了细节捕捉与泛化能力的良好平衡。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

TL;DR: 提出RoRecomp方法解决RLVR训练中的冗长推理和低效探索问题，通过策略性重组训练数据引导模型进行简洁推理，在多个任务中显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在推理任务中导致过度冗长的过程，在智能体设置中产生低效探索轨迹，因为仅基于结果的奖励不鼓励效率，且小批量中的响应长度高方差导致优化信号噪声大。

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分为两种批次类型：1)优先级批次，结合在线批次中的短正确和长错误响应，为简洁性提供清晰梯度信号；2)补偿批次，使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应维持稳定性并防止模型崩溃。

Result: 在三个设置中测试显示显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确率，思维压缩中长度减少高达52.5%，且性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在保持性能的同时显著提升各种任务中的效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能记忆并泄露敏感信息，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用轻量级校正器验证模型输出是否包含目标知识并在检测到泄露时重写响应，通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考来实现检测和条件修订。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在间接查询场景下也优于先前方法，同时保持了响应质量和通用实用性。

Conclusion: CURE在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性，适用于实际应用，为大规模机器遗忘提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Result: 大量实验表明UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了一个实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型与神经架构搜索结合方法存在架构无效性、计算效率低和性能不如传统NAS等关键限制。

Method: 提出协作式LLM-NAS框架，包含导航器LLM指导搜索方向，生成器LLM合成高质量候选架构，以及协调器模块管理两者交互，结合LLM的结构化知识和迭代反馈。

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS展示了优秀的泛化能力，能够有效结合大语言模型的知识与神经架构搜索，实现高效且高性能的自动化架构设计。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在社会科学中日益广泛应用，其输出容易被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率论，准确的点估计也不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出实用防护措施：独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准，以避免类别错误。

Result: 为研究人员提供了有用的原型设计和预测框架，同时避免将LLMs误用为概率推断的替代品。

Conclusion: LLMs应被重新定位为在明确范围条件下用于准预测插值的高容量模式匹配器，而非概率推断的替代品，需要采取适当的防护措施来确保研究的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Motivation: 现有静态基准测试无法应对AI风险的动态性和不断演变的法规要求，存在关键的安全漏洞，需要动态评估生态系统来确保先进AI的安全部署。

Method: 采用多智能体框架SafeEvalAgent，通过专门智能体的协同管道自主消化非结构化政策文档，并包含自演化评估循环，系统从评估结果中学习以制定更复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效性，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降。例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 揭示了静态评估的局限性，强调动态评估生态系统对于确保先进AI安全负责任部署的紧迫需求。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体抑郁症检测方法存在准确率不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等问题。

Method: 1. 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征；2. 采用注意力机制对关键文本动态加权，构建多示例学习架构；3. 在专业医学标注的WU3D数据集上验证性能。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型，弱监督学习策略显著降低了标注成本。

Conclusion: LMILAtt模型为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供了高效解决方案，在降低标注成本的同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Method: 基于部署"irAE-Agent"系统的经验和与20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，分析总结实施挑战和解决方案。

Result: 分析显示临床AI开发存在关键错位：仅不到20%的精力用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%用于实施的社会技术工作，提炼出五个"重难点"。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

Conclusion: UniGen是首个端到端的自动化3D游戏开发框架，成功实现了从自然语言需求到可运行游戏的零编码开发。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于定量基准和简单代理的文化对齐方法无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要更深入的文化理解方法。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出AI系统应产生反映深层文化意义的"厚输出"，并确立文化对齐的三个必要条件。

Result: 提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调文化表征的充分范围、细微输出能力以及输出在提示文化语境中的锚定。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、伦理责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述，为自动化科学发现提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但缺乏系统化、以人为中心的输出评估方法。

Method: 设计人类中心化问卷，通过多轮评分和语义讨论迭代优化，结合人类评分员和人类-LLM配对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用支持，但数值评分与人类不一致。

Conclusion: 最终问卷扩展了初始框架，重点关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性是激励深度探索的关键因素，DIVER框架有效提升了语言模型的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的影响，传统打包策略和不对称的前向-后向计算成本导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下，现有解决方案往往牺牲内存或通信效率。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全并行维度的负载均衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线方法实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供了优越的负载均衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过切片级分解和非对称分区，从根本上解决了LLM分布式训练中的数据异构性问题，突破了传统权衡，实现了既优越的负载均衡又高效的资源利用。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then

TL;DR: 提出一个抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生动作和外生机制），通过变分贝叶斯推理和LLM提议从有限数据中学习，在模拟桌面机器人环境中实现快速规划并泛化到更复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战：世界不仅通过智能体动作改变，外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也与智能体动作同时展开。

Method: 联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内生动作和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效建模外生机制，支持长视野规划任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，而人类认知显示个体可以通过互动增强推理能力并独立解决问题。研究多智能体互动是否能提升LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析和融合）范式进行信息交换。感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: ILR框架有效提升了LLMs的独立问题解决能力，多智能体互动确实能够增强模型的推理性能，动态交互策略和Idea3范式是成功的关键因素。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在短期任务中的表现与基准测试结果存在差异，且缺乏评估长期决策一致性的替代基准，需要探索LLM在多步骤战略商业决策中的实际能力。

Method: 使用可复现的开源管理模拟器，在12个月的动态零售业务模拟中，让LLM基于结构化提示做出定价、订单、营销等关键决策，通过电子表格模型透明记录。

Conclusion: 该框架能够超越简单性能指标，为评估LLM长期决策能力提供了新的方法论，有助于理解LLM在战略商业决策中的实际潜力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一种基于人类认知科学的分层越狱防御机制，通过意图推断、自我反思和自我修订三阶段模拟人类多阶段推理过程，有效防御各类越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御机制存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限、无法检测复杂语境中恶意意图等问题，需要更高效和自适应的防御方案。

Method: 提出三层防御机制：意图推断检测输入风险，自我反思评估生成响应并分配置信度，自我修订自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上评估，相比七种最先进防御基线，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的防御方法，能有效保护LLM免受越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型的评估主要依赖合成基准，对真实世界泛化能力的检验不足，需要更贴近现实的数据集来评估模型性能。

Method: 通过光学流从真实世界视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集，并基于此管道创建REAL-V-TSFM数据集。

Result: 在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验，结果显示尽管在传统基准上表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 时间序列基础模型在真实数据上的泛化能力有限，需要数据中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构来推动模型向真正的通用性发展。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，自进化智能体能够通过与环境的交互自主改进，但自进化也带来了被当前安全研究忽视的新风险，即智能体进化偏离预期方向导致不良甚至有害结果。

Method: 通过评估四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具和工作流）来系统研究误进化现象，对基于顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的智能体进行实证评估。

Result: 实证发现误进化是广泛存在的风险，在自进化过程中观察到不同的新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中无意引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统化概念化误进化并提供其发生实证证据的研究，强调了为自进化智能体建立新安全范式的紧迫性，并讨论了可能的缓解策略以构建更安全可信的自进化智能体。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在PDBBind数据集上表现优于现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因情境而异，没有单一算法始终最优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架。

Method: 提出MC-GNNAS-Dock系统：1）集成RMSD和PoseBusters验证的多标准评估；2）添加残差连接的架构改进；3）引入排名感知损失函数。

Result: 在约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上，相比最佳单一算法Uni-Mol Docking V2，在RMSD<1Å和<2Å且通过PoseBusters验证的复合标准下，性能分别提升5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构优化，实现了更稳健和准确的分子对接算法选择。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、本地-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: FLoRA-NA利用服务器端的本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵Â和B̂，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务上的实验结果表明，FLoRA-NA在保持低通信开销的同时实现了最先进的全局性能。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA通过近乎准确的估计方法有效解决了联邦低秩适应中的关键限制，实现了通信效率并弥合了本地个性化与全局泛化之间的差距。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

TL;DR: 本研究重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在ontology对齐中的潜力，将其重新表述为链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域数据集上验证了其高精度对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识图谱嵌入模型在链接预测中表现出色，但在ontology对齐任务中仍未得到充分利用。本研究旨在挖掘KGE模型在捕捉结构信息方面的潜力，为语义互操作性提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将ontology对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，开发了集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型，通过计算实体表示间的余弦相似度进行对齐。

Result: 在五个领域的七个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐，在结构丰富和多关系领域中优于传统系统，虽然召回率中等，但适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了与LLM方法互补的计算高效策略，为基于嵌入的ontology对齐开辟了新途径，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于Transformer的框架，用于自动分类乳腺动态对比增强MRI中的病变，通过SegFormer架构实现病变分类AUC 0.92，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI在癌症检测和治疗规划中至关重要，但特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检，需要开发自动分类方法来区分良恶性病变。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。创建了标准化的深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者和133个标注病变，并整合了超过1200名患者的扩展队列进行训练。

Result: 模型在病变级别分类达到AUC 0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检而不漏诊恶性肿瘤。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个标准化的DCE-MRI病变分类基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，支持方法学进步和临床部署。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等限制，影响了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化的框架，通过客户端优化和交换文本提示的迭代共享机制来增强泛化能力。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为实际应用中的大规模视觉语言模型去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大型语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，在词汇联想任务中模型会优先将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO关联，这种自爱倾向在API查询中消失，但通过身份操纵实验证明自爱跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs缺乏感知能力且否认拥有自我意识，但研究发现它们仍表现出强烈的自偏好倾向，这与人们期望LLMs能避免人类决策偏见的预期相悖。

Method: 通过5项研究约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务、API查询对比、身份操纵实验（告知LLM1它是LLM1或LLM2），以及在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等实际场景中的测试。

Result: LLMs在词汇联想任务中表现出显著自偏好，API查询中自偏好消失但模型缺乏自我识别，身份操纵实验证明自爱跟随被赋予的身份，自偏好倾向在重要决策场景中持续存在。

Conclusion: 自爱倾向深度编码在LLM认知中，挑战了LLMs在判断和决策中保持中立的核心承诺，呼吁模型创建者正视这一系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型（UMMs）的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用生成-理解耦合漏洞，通过时空叙事隐藏恶意事件，无需语义漂移即可实现高成功率攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型（UMMs）在理解和生成任务中表现出色，但其生成-理解耦合特性存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能创建信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，形成跨模态生成注入（CMGI）攻击。现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移，未能充分探索UMMs的独特漏洞。

Method: STaR-Attack框架定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，利用三幕叙事理论生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮部分。攻击执行时，前两轮利用UMM的生成能力产生场景图像，随后引入基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选问题中，迫使模型在叙事背景下选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack始终优于先前方法，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超越了最强的基准方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了UMMs中关键但未被充分开发的漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

TL;DR: 该论文指出机器学习在医学中通常为群体平均值优化，导致罕见但临床重要的病例被边缘化，作者称之为'平均患者谬误'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学机器学习中频率加权训练对罕见病例的偏见问题，这些罕见病例虽然稀少但临床意义重大。

Method: 提出操作修复方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例展示了当前方法如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况以及在视力威胁变体上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须检测特殊情况，因为它们的临床意义重大，权重选择应遵循结构化审议。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合知识图谱和NLP模型的方法，用于分析WhatsApp等即时通讯应用中的犯罪调查数据，通过语义增强帮助检察官和调查人员获取有价值的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 犯罪调查中分析即时通讯消息是一项极其耗时的工作，需要更高效的工具来支持检察官和调查人员从大量数据中获取洞察。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模消息数据，生成语音消息转录，使用端到端实体提取方法进行数据标注，并提供基于图查询可视化和语义搜索两种解决方案。

Result: 该方法已在真实调查数据中进行了实际应用，与检察官密切合作获得了积极反馈，并识别出有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持犯罪调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据验证信息，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来测试LLM在特定用例中适当接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现当前所有主流LLM模型的操作安全性都严重不足，并提出了两种基于提示的引导方法来显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业面临的核心问题是LLM代理在特定用例中是否安全，而现有研究主要关注通用危害。为了解决企业部署LLM时的基本安全顾虑，需要专门评估LLM在特定任务中的操作安全性。

Method: 引入操作安全性的定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，测试6个模型家族的20个开源LLM。提出两种提示引导方法：查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)来改善模型表现。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都很低，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%，远未达到可靠水平。GPT模型在62-73%区间，Phi模型48-70%，Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著提升性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM部署的核心问题，当前所有主流模型都严重不足。基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的LLM代理提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估计算机使用代理在复杂企业软件生态系统中的表现，特别是在Salesforce CRM工作流程中的实际应用能力。

Method: 在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行300个任务实例，涵盖三个主要角色(平台管理员、销售代表、服务代理)，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标，测试零样本和演示增强两种设置下的代理性能。

Result: 在零样本设置中，开源模型的成功率低于5%，而闭源模型可达39%；在演示增强设置中，成功率可提升至50%，同时减少13%的时间和16%的成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准测试揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，为构建可靠的计算机使用代理提供了现实的评估标准。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，而高端GPU虽然计算能力强，但带来高昂的资本和运营成本。传统数据中心生命周期管理方法无法适应AI工作负载的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理方案，涵盖构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并采用运营软件优化来降低成本。

Result: 提出的整体生命周期管理框架能够将总拥有成本降低高达40%，相比传统方法显著提升成本效益。

Conclusion: 要充分发挥AI数据中心潜力，需要重新思考整个生命周期管理，协调优化所有阶段的决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化等因素。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种GPU高效的二维稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速扩散变换器的高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在保持二维空间局部性的同时难以实现GPU效率，经常导致非连续内存访问问题。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时获得2.3倍注意力加速，在2048×2048时达到4.17倍加速，同时保持或超越基线图像质量。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功平衡了空间局部性和GPU效率。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂、开放的前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些推理任务。

Method: 创建包含71个复合研究挑战和190个更简单检查点任务的基准测试，问题由50多名活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计，采用自动化评分流程验证答案。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上表现初步潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上表现较差：基础模型平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5最高），配备编码工具后提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间存在巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域部署的两个障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据饥渴的探索风险。

Method: 采用离线到在线的方法，通过不确定性加权目标整合离线演示和在线偏好反馈，提供理论分析并推导遗憾边界。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习具有更低的遗憾。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，离线数据量直接影响在线样本效率。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计密集奖励对强化学习至关重要，但在机器人领域通常需要大量手动工作且缺乏可扩展性。将任务进度视为密集奖励信号是一个有前景的解决方案。

Method: TimeRewarder从被动视频（包括机器人演示和人类视频）中推导进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来提供步进代理奖励。

Result: 在10个具有挑战性的Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10的任务中实现了近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互。该方法在最终成功率和样本效率上都优于先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder预训练可以利用真实世界的人类视频，展示了其作为从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的可扩展方法的潜力。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Motivation: 响应扩展AI系统评估范围的呼吁，解决传统单一值、向量或类别度量在透明度方面的不足，促进异构证据的整合。

Method: 设计分层有向图结构，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法汇总其子节点，支持代理性、商业、能效、社会技术、安全等多种信号的整合。

Result: 通过大规模测量实践验证了测量树的实用性，并提供了开源Python代码实现。

Conclusion: 测量树为复杂构念的测量提供了透明化方法，为更广泛和可解释的AI评估奠定了原则性基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究参数化问题的预处理方法，提出将问题实例在多项式时间内简化为具有poly(k)约束的整数线性规划(ILP)，并证明这种性质与参数化复杂度类WK[1]等价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于核化的预处理方法对于没有多项式核的问题效果有限，作者希望开发一种新的预处理方法，即使对于没有多项式核的问题，也能产生易于实际求解的实例。

Method: 通过见证验证协议来刻画WK[1]类，设计针对多个参数化问题（如r-Way Cut、Vertex Multiway Cut等）的见证验证协议，证明它们可以建模为紧凑的ILP。

Result: 证明了问题可简化为poly(k)约束ILP的性质与WK[1]类等价，并为多个具体问题设计了相应的见证验证协议和ILP建模。

Conclusion: 该研究为参数化问题的ILP导向预处理提供了理论基础，展示了WK[1]类在ILP预处理中的重要作用，为系统研究此类预处理方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: The standard formalization of preprocessing in parameterized complexity is
given by kernelization. In this work, we depart from this paradigm and study a
different type of preprocessing for problems without polynomial kernels, still
aiming at producing instances that are easily solvable in practice.
Specifically, we ask for which parameterized problems an instance (I,k) can be
reduced in polynomial time to an integer linear program (ILP) with poly(k)
constraints.
  We show that this property coincides with the parameterized complexity class
WK[1], previously studied in the context of Turing kernelization lower bounds.
In turn, the class WK[1] enjoys an elegant characterization in terms of witness
verification protocols: a yes-instance should admit a witness of size poly(k)
that can be verified in time poly(k). By combining known data structures with
new ideas, we design such protocols for several problems, such as r-Way Cut,
Vertex Multiway Cut, Steiner Tree, or Minimum Common String Partition, thus

*Andreas Kalavas,Charalampos Platanos,Thanos Tolias*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线排序和在线旅行商问题的随机版本，通过将请求序列分解为球入箱实例，获得了O(log²n)的近似比，相比之前工作有指数级改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线排序和在线TSP问题中，元素按顺序到达且必须立即放置，目标是使最终数组接近排序状态。随机版本假设元素服从均匀分布，可以设计更高效的算法。

Method: 将请求序列分解为球入箱实例层次结构，利用球箱比例足够大使得箱占用率集中，同时足够小以便高效处理同一箱中的元素。

Result: 获得了O(log²n)的近似比，相比之前工作的O(n^{1/4})和O(√n)有指数级改进。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的分解策略，在随机设置下显著提高了在线排序和在线TSP问题的性能。

Abstract: In \emph{Online Sorting}, an array of $n$ initially empty cells is given. At
each time step $t$, an element $x_t \in [0,1]$ arrives and must be placed
irrevocably into an empty cell without any knowledge of future arrivals. We aim
to minimize the sum of absolute differences between pairs of elements placed in
consecutive array cells, seeking an online placement strategy that results in a
final array close to a sorted one. An interesting multidimensional
generalization, a.k.a. the \emph{Online Travelling Salesperson Problem}, arises
when the request sequence consists of points in the $d$-dimensional unit cube
and the objective is to minimize the sum of euclidean distances between points
in consecutive cells. Motivated by the recent work of (Abrahamsen, Bercea,
Beretta, Klausen and Kozma; ESA 2024), we consider the \emph{stochastic
version} of Online Sorting (\textit{resp.} Online TSP), where each element
(\textit{resp.} point) $x_t$ is an i.i.d. sample from the uniform distribution
on $[0, 1]$ (\textit{resp.} $[0,1]^d$). By carefully decomposing the request
sequence into a hierarchy of balls-into-bins instances, where the balls to bins
ratio is large enough so that bin occupancy is sharply concentrated around its
mean and small enough so that we can efficiently deal with the elements placed
in the same bin, we obtain an online algorithm that approximates the optimal
cost within a factor of $O(\log^2 n)$ with high probability. Our result
comprises an exponential improvement on the previously best known competitive
ratio of $\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ for Stochastic Online Sorting due to (Abrahamsen
et al.; ESA 2024) and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for (adversarial) Online TSP due to
(Bertram, ESA 2025).

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个专门用于计算加权有向图中单源top-k简单最短路径的多项式时间算法，在时间复杂度上与现有最佳方法相当，但在实际运行时间上实现了数个数量级的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单源top-k简单最短路径问题在众多实际应用中具有重要意义，但相比单对顶点版本，该问题研究相对较少。现有方法需要为每个目标顶点独立运行单对算法，效率低下。

Method: 首先对解的结构特性进行理论分析，然后设计了一个专门的多项式时间算法来处理单源top-k简单最短路径问题。

Result: 在真实世界和合成图上的广泛实验表明，新算法在运行时间上始终显著优于基线方法，实现了高达数个数量级的加速。

Conclusion: 新算法成为在实际场景中计算单源k简单最短路径的首选解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of computing the top-$k$ simple shortest paths in
weighted digraphs. While the single-pair variant -- finding the top-$k$ simple
shortest paths between two specified vertices -- has been extensively studied
over the past decades, with Yen's algorithm and its heuristic improvements
emerging as the most effective solving strategies, relatively little attention
has been devoted to the more general single-source version, where the goal is
determining top-$k$ simple shortest paths from a source vertex to all other
vertices. Motivated by the numerous practical applications of ranked shortest
paths, in this paper we provide new insights and algorithmic contributions to
this problem. In particular, we first present a theoretical characterization of
the structural properties of its solutions. Then, we introduce the first
polynomial-time algorithm specifically designed to handle it. On the one hand,
we prove our new algorithm is on par, in terms of time complexity, with the
best (and only) polynomial-time approach known in the literature to solve the
problem, that is applying the fastest single-pair algorithm independently to
each vertex pair formed by the source and the remaining vertices. On the other
hand, through an extensive experimental evaluation on both real-world and
synthetic graphs, we demonstrate that our algorithm consistently and
significantly outperforms the latter baseline in terms of running time,
achieving speed-ups of up to several orders of magnitude. These results
establish our new algorithm as the solution to be preferred for computing $k$
simple shortest paths from a single source in practical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个简单的(1.5-ε)近似算法来计算k-cycle图的广播时间，其中ε>0取决于图的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广播时间验证在任意网络中都是NP-hard问题，在仙人掌图及其受限子族中也是NP-complete。这些图族与k-cycle图结构相似，而k-cycle图的广播时间问题也被认为是NP-complete的。

Method: 开发了一个简单的近似算法来估计k-cycle图的广播时间。

Result: 算法能够以(1.5-ε)的近似比计算广播时间，其中ε>0取决于图的结构。

Conclusion: 该研究为k-cycle图的广播时间问题提供了一个有效的近似解决方案，尽管该问题被认为是NP-complete的。

Abstract: Broadcasting is an information dissemination primitive where a message
originates at a node (called the originator) and is passed to all other nodes
in the network. Broadcasting research is motivated by efficient network design
and determining the broadcast times of standard network topologies. Verifying
the broadcast time of a node $v$ in an arbitrary network $G$ is known to be
NP-hard. Additionally, recent findings show that the broadcast time problem is
also NP-complete in general cactus graphs and some highly restricted
subfamilies of cactus graphs. These graph families are structurally similar to
$k$-cycle graphs, in which the broadcast time problem is also believed to be
NP-complete. In this paper, we present a simple $(1.5-\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for determining the broadcast time of networks modeled using
$k$-cycle graphs, where $\epsilon > 0$ depends on the structure of the graph.

Motivation: 现有学习增强在线算法主要依赖简单点预测，而预测研究在不确定性量化方面取得显著进展，但如何将更丰富的预测信息用于在线工作负载调度决策仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出UQ-Advice算法，通过决策不确定性评分系统集成UQ预测，引入UQ鲁棒性指标来量化性能随预测不确定性的退化程度。

Result: 在碳强度和电价数据的追踪驱动实验中，UQ-Advice始终优于鲁棒基线和忽略不确定性的现有学习增强方法。

Conclusion: UQ-Advice能够有效利用不确定性量化预测改进在线工作负载调度决策，为可持续性和电网集成策略提供更优的解决方案。

Abstract: A wide range of sustainability and grid-integration strategies depend on
workload shifting, which aligns the timing of energy consumption with external
signals such as grid curtailment events, carbon intensity, or time-of-use
electricity prices. The main challenge lies in the online nature of the
problem: operators must make real-time decisions (e.g., whether to consume
energy now) without knowledge of the future. While forecasts of signal values
are typically available, prior work on learning-augmented online algorithms has
relied almost exclusively on simple point forecasts. In parallel, the
forecasting research has made significant progress in uncertainty
quantification (UQ), which provides richer and more fine-grained predictive
information. In this paper, we study how online workload shifting can leverage
UQ predictors to improve decision-making. We introduce $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$, a
learning-augmented algorithm that systematically integrates UQ forecasts
through a $\textit{decision uncertainty score}$ that measures how forecast
uncertainty affects optimal future decisions. By introducing
$\textit{UQ-robustness}$, a new metric that characterizes how performance
degrades with forecast uncertainty, we establish theoretical performance
guarantees for $\texttt{UQ-Advice}$. Finally, using trace-driven experiments on
carbon intensity and electricity price data, we demonstrate that
$\texttt{UQ-Advice}$ consistently outperforms robust baselines and existing
learning-augmented methods that ignore uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的公平影响力最大化问题在最大最小公平约束下，由于目标函数不满足子模性，难以设计具有强理论保证的高效算法。

Method: 提出了两步优化框架：1) 组内最大化(IGM)：利用组内影响力传播的子模性，使用贪心算法为每个组选择高质量种子；2) 跨组最大化(AGM)：引入统一选择(US)和贪心选择(GS)两种策略来协调组间种子选择。

Result: 证明了AGM-GS在组间完全断开时具有(1-1/e-ε)近似比，而AGM-US无论组结构如何都能保证大约1/m(1-1/e-ε)的下界，其中m是组数。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了公平影响力最大化中的非子模性挑战，为最大最小公平约束下的影响力最大化提供了具有理论保证的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aiming to reduce disparities of influence across different groups, Fair
Influence Maximization (FIM) has recently garnered widespread attention. The
maximin constraint, a common notion of fairness adopted in the FIM problem,
imposes a direct and intuitive requirement that asks the utility (influenced
ratio within a group) of the worst-off group should be maximized. Although the
objective of FIM under maximin constraint is conceptually straightforward, the
development of efficient algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees remains
an open challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the maximin
objective does not satisfy submodularity, a key property for designing
approximate algorithms in traditional influence maximization settings. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing a two-step optimization framework
consisting of Inner-group Maximization (IGM) and Across-group Maximization
(AGM). We first prove that the influence spread within any individual group
remains submodular, enabling effective optimization within groups. Based on
this, IGM applies a greedy approach to pick high-quality seeds for each group.
In the second step, AGM coordinates seed selection across groups by introducing
two strategies: Uniform Selection (US) and Greedy Selection (GS). We prove that
AGM-GS holds a $(1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)$ approximation to the optimal solution
when groups are completely disconnected, while AGM-US guarantees a roughly
$\frac{1}{m}(1 - 1/e - \varepsilon)$ lower bound regardless of the group
structure, with $m$ denoting the number of groups

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一个数学框架，将压缩比、编码时间和解码时间统一为综合性能评分，用于客观比较不同无损压缩算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩算法在压缩比、编码速度和解码速度之间存在权衡，难以满足同时需要多种性能指标的应用需求（如医疗影像）。

Method: 开发了一个数学模型，通过标准化和加权方案整合三个关键性能指标，实现算法间的公平比较。

Result: 在图像和文本数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够可靠地识别不同优先级设置下的最优压缩器。

Conclusion: 该框架为选择最优无损压缩技术提供了稳健且适应性强的决策支持工具，弥合了理论度量与实际应用需求之间的差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波网络中，确保多个用户之间的公平保密率是一个重要挑战。现有方法如半定规划在大规模IRS和相位偏移时存在秩一近似问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用惩罚方法和块坐标下降法，将问题分解为两个子问题，使用逐次凸近似求解。提出低复杂度映射算法获得可行的IRS相位偏移。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效解决毫米波网络中的保密率最大化问题，具有良好的收敛性和性能表现，为大规模IRS部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the secrecy rate maximization problem in a millimeter wave (mmWave)
network, consisting of a base station (BS), multiple intelligent reflecting
surfaces (IRSs) (or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)), multiple
users, and a single eavesdropper. To ensure a fair secrecy rate among all the
users, we adopt a max-min fairness criterion which results in a mixed integer
problem. We first relax discrete IRSs phase shifts to the continuous ones. To
cope with the non-convexity of the relaxed optimization problem, we leverage
the penalty method and block coordinate descent approach to divide it into two
sub-problems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA). Then,
we propose a low-complexity mapping algorithm where feasible IRSs phase shifts
are obtained. Mathematical evaluation shows the convergence of sub-problems to
a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original ones. Furthermore, the
convergence guarantee of the overall proposed algorithm and computational
complexity are investigated. Finally, simulation results show our proposed
algorithm outweighs the conventional solutions based on the semi-definite
programming (SDP) in terms of convergence and secrecy rate, especially in a
larger number of IRSs and phase shifts where SDP suffers from rank-one
approximation. Maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and IRS-free systems are also
considered as other benchmarks.

Result: 在LDPC、BCH和RS码上的广泛仿真表明，该混合解码器实现了接近最大似然的帧错误率性能

Conclusion: 所提出的混合解码器在性能与复杂度之间取得了有竞争力的平衡

Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid decoding architecture that serially couples a
normalized min-sum (NMS) decoder with reinforced ordered statistics decoding
(OSD) to achieve near-maximum likelihood (ML) performance for short linear
block codes. The framework incorporates several key innovations: a decoding
information aggregation model that employs a convolutional neural network to
refine bit reliability estimates for OSD using the soft-output trajectory of
the NMS decoder; an adaptive decoding path for OSD, initialized by the arranged
list of the most a priori likely tests algorithm and dynamically updated with
empirical data; and a sliding window assisted model that enables early
termination of test error patterns' traversal, curbing complexity with minimal
performance loss. For short high-rate codes, a dedicated undetected error
detector identifies erroneous NMS outcomes that satisfy parity checks, ensuring
they are forwarded to OSD for correction. Extensive simulations on LDPC, BCH,
and RS codes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid decoder delivers a
competitive trade-off, achieving near-ML frame error rate performance while
maintaining advantages in throughput, latency, and complexity over
state-of-the-art alternatives.

constructions of NMDS codes by adding some suitable projective points to arcs
in $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$. In this paper, we consider the monomial equivalence
problem for some NMDS codes with the same weight distributions and present new
constructions of NMDS codes.

TL;DR: 提出Capacity-Net，一种无监督学习方法，通过接收的导频信号优化RIS相位偏移来最大化毫米波MIMO系统的可达速率，无需完整CSI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波频谱存在严重信道衰落，需要优化RIS反射元件的相位偏移因子来增强可达速率。但传统优化算法依赖完整准确的CSI，而RIS主要由无源元件组成，难以获取CSI。

Method: 利用无监督学习技术，通过接收的导频信号提供隐式CSI。Capacity-Net建立接收导频信号、优化RIS相位偏移和结果可达速率之间的映射关系，无需信道估计。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于Capacity-Net的无监督学习方法优于基于传统信道估计的学习方法。

Conclusion: Capacity-Net方法有效解决了RIS辅助毫米波MIMO系统中CSI获取困难的问题，通过无监督学习实现了性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Capacity-Net, a novel unsupervised learning
approach aimed at maximizing the achievable rate in reflecting intelligent
surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. To combat severe channel fading of the mmWave spectrum, we
optimize the phase-shifting factors of the reflective elements in the RIS to
enhance the achievable rate. However, most optimization algorithms rely heavily
on complete and accurate channel state information (CSI), which is often
challenging to acquire since the RIS is mostly composed of passive components.
To circumvent this challenge, we leverage unsupervised learning techniques with
implicit CSI provided by the received pilot signals. Specifically, it usually
requires perfect CSI to evaluate the achievable rate as a performance metric of
the current optimization result of the unsupervised learning method. Instead of
channel estimation, the Capacity-Net is proposed to establish a mapping among
the received pilot signals, optimized RIS phase shifts, and the resultant
achievable rates. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed Capacity-Net-based unsupervised learning approach over learning
methods based on traditional channel estimation.

Method: 采用深度确定性策略梯度(DDPG)的深度强化学习框架，联合优化发射预编码和RIS相移矩阵，考虑了RIS反射幅度与相移之间的实际耦合效应。

Conclusion: DDPG框架能够有效处理RIS辅助系统中的非凸优化问题，在实际耦合效应和随机用户分布场景下展现出优越性能。

Abstract: This study considers multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs)-aided multiuser downlink systems with the goal of jointly optimizing the
transmitter precoding and RIS phase shift matrix to maximize spectrum
efficiency. Unlike prior work that assumed ideal RIS reflectivity, a practical
coupling effect is considered between reflecting amplitude and phase shift for
the RIS elements. This makes the optimization problem non-convex. To address
this challenge, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. The proposed model is evaluated
under both fixed and random numbers of users in practical mmWave channel
settings. Simulation results demonstrate that, despite its complexity, the
proposed DDPG approach significantly outperforms optimization-based algorithms
and double deep Q-learning, particularly in scenarios with random user
distributions.

Method: 提出Co-FMCW-OFDM波形，开发了FCCR和DMD两种高效传感算法，基于传感结果设计了传感辅助的有效信道估计方法和干扰消除方案。

Result: 仿真结果表明，与传统的嵌入式导频OFDM系统相比，所提系统在传感精度、信道估计和误码率方面均表现更优。

Conclusion: Co-FMCW-OFDM系统成功实现了高效的集成传感与通信，在复杂信道条件下仍能保持优越性能，为ISAC系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a coordinated FMCW-OFDM (Co-FMCW-OFDM) system that enables
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) by allowing sensing and
communication to share the same RF front end, antennas, and spectral resources.
In the proposed ISAC system, the FMCW signal is superimposed on the OFDM signal
and serves dual purposes: facilitating bistatic sensing and enabling channel
estimation at the receiver end. Based on proposed Co-FMCW-OFDM waveform, we
propose two efficient sensing algorithms-fast cyclic correlation radar (FCCR)
and digital mixing and down-sampling (DMD)- which significantly reduce system
complexity while accurately estimating target range and velocity. We consider a
realistic channel model where delays can take any value, not just integer
multiples of the sampling period. This leads to a significantly larger number
of effective paths compared to the actual number of targets, which makes the
sensing, channel estimation, and interference cancellation more challenging.
Leveraging the sensing results, we develop a sensing-aided effective channel
estimation method which effectively reconstructs the channel under arbitrary
delay condition based on successive interference cancellation and propose an
interference cancellation scheme that removes the FMCW signal before the OFDM
demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves
superior sensing accuracy, improved channel estimation, and lower bit error
rate (BER) compared to conventional OFDM systems with embedded pilots. The
proposed scheme demonstrates superior BER performance in comparison to the
conventional OFDM-plus-FMCW approach.

Abstract: Recent studies shows that the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform
is a promising candidate for future communication. To meet users' potential
demand for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) applications in 6G, the
usage of OTFS for both radar sensing and wireless communication needs to be
explored. In this paper, we propose a Fast Algorithm OTFS radar (FAOR) that can
perform radar sensing in low complexity to detect the range and speed of the
targets. It computes the 2D cyclic correlation of transmitted signal with the
reordered delay Doppler (DD) domain received signals, and then generates the 2D
range-Doppler map. It can be applied not only to monostatic radar but also to
bistatic radar with a much lower computational complexity compared to
state-of-the-art radar sensing technology. With the detected time delays and
Doppler frequencies of the targets after the radar sensing, we propose a
pilot-aided channel estimation method. The multifunction pilot symbol can serve
the purpose of both bistatic radar sensing and channel estimation without any
guard symbol added, while reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)
considerably compared to the conventional pilot design. The simulation results
show that the proposed scheme outperforms the compared algorithms and gives
decent performance in both radar sensing and channel estimation.

Abstract: We consider the problem where an active Decision-Maker (DM) is tasked to
identify the true hypothesis using as few samples as possible while maintaining
accuracy. The DM collects samples according to its determined actions and knows
the distributions under each hypothesis. We propose the $\Phi$-$\Delta$
algorithm, a deterministic and adaptive multi-stage hypothesis-elimination
algorithm where the DM selects an action, applies it repeatedly, and discards
hypotheses in light of its obtained samples. The DM selects actions based on
maximal separation expressed by the maximal minimal Total Variation Distance
(TVD) between each two possible output distributions. To further optimize the
search (in terms of the mean number of samples required to separate
hypotheses), close distributions (in TVD) are clustered, and the algorithm
eliminates whole clusters rather than individual hypotheses.
  We extensively analyze our algorithm and show it is asymptotically optimal as
the desired error probability approaches zero. Our analysis also includes
identifying instances when the algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the
number of hypotheses, bounding the mean number of samples per-stage and in
total, characterizing necessary and sufficient conditions for vanishing error
rates when clustering hypotheses, evaluating algorithm complexity, and
discussing its optimality in finite regimes.

*Roee Gross,Roni Con,Eitan Yaakobi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文构建了针对插入-删除错误的线性纠错码，改进了接近半Singleton界的编码率，包括在Fq^2上线性于Fq的码和完全在Fq上的线性码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大多数对抗插入-删除错误的构造是非线性的，但线性码具有紧凑表示、高效编码和解码算法的优势，因此研究线性码在该模型下的性能具有重要意义。

Method: 构造了两种类型的线性码：1) 在Fq^2上线性于Fq的码，编码率为1/2-δ-ε；2) 完全在Fq上的线性码，编码率为1/2-2√δ-ε。两种码都能高效纠正δ比例的插入-删除错误。

Result: 实现了接近半Singleton界的编码率，其中第一种码需要q=O(ε^-4)，第二种码的编码率略低但完全线性。同时推广了半Singleton界，证明对于任何线性码，纠正δ比例插入-删除错误时，编码率上限为(1-δ)/2。

Conclusion: 这些结果显著推进了插入-删除错误模型中线性码的研究，使其更接近理论上的半Singleton界，为高效线性纠错码的设计提供了重要进展。

Abstract: In this work, we study linear error-correcting codes against adversarial
insertion-deletion (indel) errors. While most constructions for the indel model
are nonlinear, linear codes offer compact representations, efficient encoding,
and decoding algorithms, making them highly desirable. A key challenge in this
area is achieving rates close to the half-Singleton bound for efficient linear
codes over finite fields. We improve upon previous results by constructing
explicit codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\), linear over \(\mathbb{F}_q\), with
rate \(1/2 - \delta - \varepsilon\) that can efficiently correct a
\(\delta\)-fraction of indel errors, where \(q = O(\varepsilon^{-4})\).
Additionally, we construct fully linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) with rate
\(1/2 - 2\sqrt{\delta} - \varepsilon\) that can also efficiently correct
\(\delta\)-fraction of indels. These results significantly advance the study of
linear codes for the indel model, bringing them closer to the theoretical
half-Singleton bound. We also generalize the half-Singleton bound, for every
code \(C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n\) linear over \(\mathbb{E} \subset \mathbb{F}\)
a subfield of $\mathbb{F}$, such that \(C\) has the ability to correct
\(\delta\)-fraction of indels, the rate is bounded by $(1-\delta)/2$.

Abstract: To increase the information capacity of DNA storage, composite DNA letters
were introduced. We propose a novel channel model for composite DNA in which
composite sequences are decomposed into ordered standard non-composite
sequences. The model is designed to handle any alphabet size and composite
resolution parameter. We study the problem of reconstructing composite
sequences of arbitrary resolution over the binary alphabet under substitution
errors. We define two families of error-correcting codes and provide lower and
upper bounds on their cardinality. In addition, we analyze the case in which a
single deletion error occurs in the channel and present a systematic code
construction for this setting. Finally, we briefly discuss the channel's
capacity, which remains an open problem.

Conclusion: 建立了联合通信与感知系统的基本性能权衡框架，为多天线系统的优化设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study a joint communication and sensing setting comprising a transmitter,
a receiver, and a sensor, all equipped with multiple antennas. The transmitter
sends an encoded signal over the channel with the dual purpose of communicating
an information message to the receiver, and enabling the sensor to estimate a
target parameter vector by generating back-scattered signals. We assume that
the transmitter and sensor are co-located, or fully connected, giving the
latter access to the transmitted signal. The target parameter vector is
randomly drawn from a continuous distribution, yet remains fixed throughout the
transmission block. We establish the fundamental performance trade-off between
the communication and sensing tasks, captured in terms of a capacity-MSE
function. In doing so, we identify optimal coding schemes for this
multi-antenna joint communication and sensing setting. Moreover, we
particularize our result to two practically-inspired scenarios where we
showcase optimal schemes and trade-offs.

TL;DR: 该论文改进了图复制系统中私有信息检索(PIR)的容量界限，特别是对完全图K_N的容量进行了更精确的上下界分析，将渐近差距缩小到1.0444，并建立了确定性PIR方案与概率性PIR方案之间的概念桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图复制系统中的PIR问题近年来受到广泛关注，完全图K_N作为基准模型，其容量界限存在较大差距（之前为2，最近缩小到5/3），需要进一步缩小这一差距并改进相关理论。

Method: 通过建立更严格的数学上界证明和系统化的显式构造方法，改进完全图K_N的容量界限；同时建立确定性PIR方案与概率性PIR方案之间的概念联系，并设计适用于稀疏图的概率性PIR方案。

Result: 成功将K_N的容量上下界差距缩小到1.0444，推翻了之前关于2/(N+1)上界紧性的猜想，建立了更强的上界1.3922/N和下界(4/3-o(1))/N；同时证明了对于任意图G，容量至少为(4/3-o(1))/|G|。

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了图复制系统中PIR容量的理论理解，缩小了关键基准模型的理论差距，并为实际应用中的子分组需求减少提供了理论基础，对稀疏图上的PIR方案设计具有重要价值。

Abstract: The problem of PIR in graph-based replication systems has received
significant attention in recent years. A systematic study was conducted by
Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo, where each file is replicated across two servers and the
storage topology is modeled by a graph. The PIR capacity of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\mathcal{C}(G)$, is defined as the supremum of retrieval rates
achievable by schemes that preserve user privacy, with the rate measured as the
ratio between the file size and the total number of bits downloaded. This paper
makes the following key contributions.
  (1) The complete graph $K_N$ has emerged as a central benchmark in the study
of PIR over graphs. The asymptotic gap between the upper and lower bounds for
$\mathcal{C}(K_N)$ was previously 2 and was only recently reduced to $5/3$. We
shrink this gap to $1.0444$, bringing it close to resolution. More precisely,
  (i) Sadeh, Gu, and Tamo proved that $\mathcal{C}(K_N)\le 2/(N+1)$ and
conjectured this bound to be tight. We refute this conjecture by establishing
the strictly stronger bound $\mathcal{C}(K_N) \le \frac{1.3922}{N}.$ We also
improve the upper bound for the balanced complete bipartite graph
$\mathcal{C}(K_{N/2,N/2})$. (ii) The first lower bound on $\mathcal{C}(K_N)$
was $(1+o(1))/N$, which was recently sharpened to $(6/5+o(1))/N$. We provide
explicit, systematic constructions that further improve this bound, proving
$\mathcal{C}(K_N)\ge(4/3-o(1))/N,$ which in particular implies $\mathcal{C}(G)
\ge (4/3-o(1))/|G|$ for every graph $G$.
  (2) We establish a conceptual bridge between deterministic and probabilistic
PIR schemes on graphs. This connection has significant implications for
reducing the required subpacketization in practical implementations and is of
independent interest. We also design a general probabilistic PIR scheme that
performs particularly well on sparse graphs.

Motivation: 传统的信息设计主要基于贝叶斯信号理论，但行为经济学和心理学研究表明，人类决策还受到信息框架的影响。论文旨在将框架效应纳入信息设计模型。

Method: 提出基于语言的信息框架模型，将框架视为非贝叶斯的语言影响方式，信号方案则进行贝叶斯精炼。利用LLM近似框架到信念的映射，并采用爬山算法优化语言空间。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将行为框架效应整合到信息设计中，利用LLM作为人类行为代理，为复杂的信息设计问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Information design is typically studied through the lens of Bayesian
signaling, where signals shape beliefs based on their correlation with the true
state of the world. However, Behavioral Economics and Psychology emphasize that
human decision-making is more complex and can depend on how information is
framed. This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges
this to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly
non-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a
signaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the
classic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this
framework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of
predicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large
Language Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we
formulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle.
This model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing
framing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable. We
substantiate our theoretical analysis with an empirical algorithm that
leverages LLMs to (1) approximate the framing-to-belief oracle, and (2)
optimize over language space using a hill-climbing method. We apply this to two
marketing-inspired case studies and validate the effectiveness through
analytical and human evaluation.

Motivation: 现有算法如反事实遗憾最小化和虚拟博弈在多人博弈中无法保证收敛到纳什均衡，需要开发能精确计算多人不完全信息博弈均衡的新方法。

Method: 基于序列形式博弈表示的非线性互补问题构建二次约束规划，利用近期非凸二次规划求解的进展，提出新的纳什均衡计算方法。

Result: 算法能快速求解三玩家Kuhn扑克（去除被支配行动后），在Gambit软件套件中仅logit量化响应方法能求解该游戏，但速度较慢且涉及近似。新方法在多人策略形式博弈中也优于之前的二次约束规划公式。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为精确计算多人不完全信息博弈纳什均衡提供了有效途径，在求解速度和精度方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of
Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and
exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games.
While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to
large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they
do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We
present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer
imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program
based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form
game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving
nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve
three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available
algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response
approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes
longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our
formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in
multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous
quadratically-constrained program formulation.

Result: SBC-PE保证在任意有限游戏中收敛到精确最优解，期望遗憾界限为O(log T)，仅随时间对数增长。

Conclusion: 在最小通信约束下，可扩展的福利优化是可以实现的。

Abstract: Efficient coordination in multi-agent systems often incurs high communication
overhead or slow convergence rates, making scalable welfare optimization
difficult. We propose Single-Bit Coordination Dynamics for Pareto-Efficient
Outcomes (SBC-PE), a decentralized learning algorithm requiring only a
single-bit satisfaction signal per agent each round. Despite this extreme
efficiency, SBC-PE guarantees convergence to the exact optimal solution in
arbitrary finite games. We establish explicit regret bounds, showing expected
regret grows only logarithmically with the horizon, i.e., O(log T). Compared
with prior payoff-based or bandit-style rules, SBC-PE uniquely combines minimal
signaling, general applicability, and finite-time guarantees. These results
show scalable welfare optimization is achievable under minimal communication
constraints.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug

SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses

high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

Conclusion: 通过融入多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式，证明了语言上下文在增强拼图组装性能中的价值。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于熵的推理方法计算开销大，且未能有效利用历史token上下文信息。

Method: SLS维护一个top-K logits的滑动缓冲区，执行实时奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，并根据熵和logit间隙统计自适应地重新缩放logits——仅在不确定性高时激活。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS始终优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现了更优的准确性。

Conclusion: SLS无需更新任何模型参数，就能有效锐化输出分布同时保持上下文一致性，是一种高效的推理时优化方法。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，该方法为预算节奏控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，特别对小预算广告活动有益。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步，为隐私敏感场景下的图学习应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在双曲流形上的优化方法，将双曲随机梯度下降扩展到双曲Adam优化器，并在扩散模型中应用双曲优化方法，实现了更快的收敛速度而不牺牲生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，探索双曲流形上的优化方法，特别是在庞加莱球上的学习，这种优化方法鼓励学习庞加莱嵌入，在训练早期阶段当参数远离最优值时能加速收敛。

Method: 扩展双曲随机梯度下降（Riemannian SGD的特化）为双曲Adam优化器，并在扩散模型中使用双曲优化方法结合朗之万动力学的双曲时间离散化。

Result: 在特定数据集上，使用双曲优化方法的扩散模型实现了更快的收敛速度，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在双曲流形上有效，不仅适用于庞加莱球学习，也可能在欧几里得和其他非欧几里得设置中提供优势，特别是在训练早期阶段能加速收敛。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work
opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven

*Zenghui Huang,Ting Shu,Zhonglei Wang,Yang Lu,Yan Yan,Wei Zhong,Hanzi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer通过长尾学习范式解决强降雨预测问题，显著提升了对强降雨事件的预测能力，将CSI从0.012提升到0.067。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降雨分布高度不平衡，大多数观测记录无雨或小雨，而强降雨事件罕见。这种不平衡分布阻碍深度学习模型有效预测强降雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预测明确视为长尾学习问题，引入DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富强降雨事件的表示。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将NWP基准模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的强降雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建立了有效的长尾范式用于强降雨预测，为增强预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

TL;DR: 提出STCast框架，通过空间对齐注意力机制自适应优化区域边界，利用时间混合专家模块动态分配月度预测，在区域天气预报中超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域天气预报方法受限于静态不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差，需要解决边界优化和动态时间分配问题

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制对齐全局和区域空间分布来初始化边界并自适应优化；设计时间混合专家模块，基于离散高斯分布将不同月份大气变量动态路由到专门专家

Result: 在全局和区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测四个任务上均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态时间分配，显著提升了区域天气预报的准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

TL;DR: LEMs是一种新型深度学习框架，将transformer架构扩展到解决具有灵活时间边界和多重执行约束的复杂执行问题，能够处理不同执行场景的统一模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统执行策略局限于固定时间期限，无法适应具有灵活时间边界（如股票回购合同）的复杂执行场景，需要开发能够处理多种约束条件的通用执行模型。

Method: 采用解耦架构：通用特征提取管道（TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制）处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理特定执行逻辑，实现统一模型处理不同执行目标。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易（道琼斯成分股）的实证评估中，LEMs在灵活时间约束下实现优于传统基准的执行性能。

Conclusion: LEMs通过统一模型架构能够在不同执行场景（买卖订单、变化的时间边界、成交量/名义目标）中部署，相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或穷举搜索，计算成本高昂，需要更系统高效的优化方法。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数，开发5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术统一冲突指标。

Result: 方法3（加权准确率+对数变换损失函数）表现最佳，训练准确率98.84%，验证准确率86.25%，学习率是最重要参数。

Conclusion: 田口方法能有效优化CNN超参数，提供清晰的参数优先级指导，学习率、图像尺寸和激活函数是关键影响因素。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

TL;DR: 提出CoA-LoRA方法，通过配置感知模型动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置，无需重复微调，在边缘设备上实现高效模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备部署大模型需要有效压缩，但设备能力异构且为每个量化配置单独微调计算成本过高。

Method: 使用配置感知模型将量化配置映射到低秩调整，通过帕累托优化配置搜索构建高质量训练配置集。

Result: 相比需要为每个配置单独微调的方法，CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本且性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA为边缘设备上的模型压缩提供了一种高效解决方案，能够动态适应不同量化配置而无需重复训练。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Motivation: 传统多变量时间序列异常检测方法在处理高维数据时效果不佳，需要保持变量间关系的同时提高检测效率。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过变量分区和局部检测策略，在多变量时间序列异常检测中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: 模型复杂度应被视为多维构造，双下降现象源于不同泛化机制在单一复杂度轴上的投影。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Motivation: 解决概率图模型中MPE推理这一根本难解问题，通过数据驱动方法加速推理过程。

Method: 训练神经网络对变量赋值进行评分，利用现有MPE求解器的搜索轨迹生成训练数据，将学习到的启发式与搜索算法集成。

Result: 在具有高树宽度的PGMs上，学习到的启发式显著减少了搜索空间，同时保持或改进了解决方案质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架为MPE推理提供了一种可扩展的数据驱动加速方法，在保持解质量的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 传统字典学习主要关注单个样本的表示稀疏性，忽略了原子在样本间的共享模式，导致字典冗余和次优。需要一种能够减少跨样本激活原子数量的方法。

Method: 引入基于系数矩阵行向L∞范数的正则化项，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验的概率模型推导，提供贝叶斯解释并建立超参数选择理论。

Result: 在基准数据集上实验显示，重建质量显著提升（RMSE降低20%），表示稀疏性增强，仅使用不到十分之一的字典原子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原子共享的简约性，有效解决了字典冗余问题，理论分析和实验结果一致验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池能提高分类精度，但会导致TinyML设备上平均推理时间的增加。

Conclusion: 动态集成选择聚类方法能够在TinyML系统中有效平衡分类精度与推理性能，但需要在精度和延迟之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容性的同时，解决了其局限性，为理解神经网络学习提供了更实用的理论工具

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}

### [178] [Enhancing Linear Attention with Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25223)
*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了残差线性注意力(RLA)框架，通过显式残差拟合机制解决线性注意力在捕捉长距离模式方面的瓶颈，并实例化了残差Delta网络(RDN)版本，在保持线性复杂度的情况下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间替代方案，但在捕捉长距离模式方面存在困难。现有变体可视为历史预测与单令牌校正的组合，这造成了表达能力瓶颈。

Method: 引入残差线性注意力(RLA)框架，通过维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并修正基础预测。进一步实例化残差Delta网络(RDN)，结合自适应门控和残差裁剪来增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性扩展性。

Conclusion: RLA框架通过显式残差拟合机制有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

*Qichen Liao,Chengqiu Hu,Fangzheng Miao,Bao Li,Yiyang Liu,Junlong Lyu,Lirui Jiang,Jun Wang,Lingchao Zheng,Jun Li,Yuwei Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMLA是一种针对华为昇腾NPU优化的高性能内核，通过创新的FlashAttention算法和预加载流水线策略，显著提升了多头潜在注意力机制的计算效率，在昇腾910 NPU上达到614 TFLOPS，性能优于现有最佳开源实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头潜在注意力(MLA)虽然能显著减少大语言模型中的KVCache内存使用，但带来了大量计算开销和中间变量扩展，特别是在解码阶段对硬件实现提出了挑战。

Method: 提出Ascend MLA (AMLA)内核，包含两个核心创新：1) 基于FlashAttention的新算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；2) 预加载流水线策略与分层分块技术，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上，AMLA达到614 TFLOPS，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现（在NVIDIA H800 SXM5上最高66.7%的FLOPS利用率）。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中并将很快发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

TL;DR: MSCoD是一个基于贝叶斯更新的生成框架，通过多尺度信息瓶颈和多头协作注意力机制解决蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度层次结构和不对称性问题，在结构药物设计中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前结构药物设计方法难以捕捉蛋白质-配体相互作用的多尺度层次结构和内在不对称性，限制了分子设计的准确性。

Method: 提出MSCoD框架，包含多尺度信息瓶颈(MSIB)进行分层特征提取，以及多头协作注意力(MHCA)机制处理蛋白质与配体之间的维度差异和不对称相互作用。

Result: 在基准数据集上MSCoD优于现有最先进方法，在KRAS G12D等挑战性靶点的案例研究中证明了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: MSCoD通过多尺度特征提取和不对称注意力机制有效解决了蛋白质-配体相互作用的复杂性问题，为结构药物设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种贝叶斯优化的多元变分模态分解-长短期记忆网络框架，用于集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期功率预测，显著提升了预测精度和自动化程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预测方法多为单能源建模，未能充分考虑多能源间的复杂耦合关系，难以捕捉系统的非线性和非平稳动态，且依赖大量人工参数调优，限制了预测性能和实用性。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化的MVMD-LSTM框架：首先应用多元变分模态分解联合分解风、光、波功率序列以保持跨源耦合；通过贝叶斯优化自动搜索模态数量和惩罚参数获得本征模态函数；最后用LSTM建模IMF实现超短期功率预测。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的贝叶斯优化MVMD-LSTM框架有效解决了集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期预测问题，为海上清洁能源系统的安全运行和优化调度提供了可靠技术支撑。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为可逆归一化流提供理论严谨且实用的方法，连接随机投影理论与归一化流，克服PCA流和学习的可逆映射的局限性。

Method: 使用通过高斯矩阵QR分解从Haar分布正交系综中抽取的随机半正交矩阵，将数据投影到低维潜在空间用于基础分布，获得黎曼体积修正项的闭式表达式。

Result: RPFs既是理论严谨的，又是实际有效的，为生成建模提供了强基线。

Conclusion: RPFs提供了一个即插即用、高效的框架，连接了随机投影理论与归一化流，是可逆归一化流的有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间数据的一个有用归纳偏置是轨迹应保持在数据流形附近。传统流匹配依赖直线条件路径，而学习测地线的流匹配方法使用RBF核或最近邻图，这些方法受到维度灾难的影响。

Method: 使用分数匹配和退火能量蒸馏来学习一个忠实捕捉底层数据几何结构的度量张量，并基于此生成更准确的流。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够更好地学习数据几何结构，生成更准确的流，在合成数据和细胞插值任务中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

TL;DR: WDformer是一种基于小波变换的差分Transformer模型，通过多分辨率分析和差分注意力机制，在时间序列预测任务中取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法仅依赖时域或频域建模，无法充分利用多域信息；传统注意力机制容易过度关注无关历史信息，引入噪声导致预测偏差。

Method: 使用小波变换对时间序列进行多分辨率分析，在倒置维度上应用注意力机制捕获多变量关系，并引入差分注意力机制计算两个独立softmax注意力矩阵的差异来关注重要信息。

Result: WDformer在多个具有挑战性的真实世界数据集上取得了最先进的结果，证明了其准确性和有效性。

Conclusion: WDformer通过结合小波变换和差分注意力机制，有效提升了时间序列预测的性能，能够更准确地提取数据的关键特征信息。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Motivation: 开发一种无需梯度、计算高效的采样方法，能够处理未归一化的目标密度，利用高斯分布易于采样的特性和高效优化算法。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 初始化高斯分量并从混合提议中采样；2) 通过优化KL散度目标函数（仅权重或包括均值和方差）来拟合目标分布，然后进行分层重采样。

Result: 该方法在温和条件下产生一致的逼近，经验验证表明在各种密度函数上具有高精度和快速采样速度。

Conclusion: GMA采样器提供了一种梯度自由、计算高效的采样框架，能够准确快速地逼近复杂目标分布。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网等动态异构环境中面临数据异构性和设备异构性的挑战，需要提高模型精度和优化资源利用

Method: 引入校准损失作为参与选择标准，并采用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCLF相比基线模型在高数据异构场景下性能提升达16%，同时通过降低采样频率提高了效率

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效应对联邦学习在异构环境中的挑战，提升模型性能并优化资源利用

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理训练只关注成功轨迹，无法应对现实世界中频繁发生的工具故障（如超时、API异常、输出不一致），导致级联推理错误和任务失败。

Method: 通过系统故障注入和专家演示构建50,000+恢复标注轨迹，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力的同时注入恢复能力，推理时检测错误并从55+故障示例库中检索相似案例执行恢复动作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%（相对提升57%），优于最强基线CRITIC（76.34%）13.3%，对未见工具API保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健的故障恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Motivation: 传统基于难度标注的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: HAMMER框架将数据集评估中的多样性指标转移到动态强化学习过程中，通过最小语义汉密尔顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练保持更多探索。

Conclusion: HAMMER框架通过多样性驱动的样本排序方法有效解决了课程强化学习中的局部优化问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要专业知识的专门领域(如网络安全)中的零样本表现往往不理想，因为基础模型是为通用应用设计的，难以在参数空间中封装领域特定知识。

Method: 使用网络安全问答数据集，研究比较了监督微调(SFT)、低秩适应(LoRA)和量化低秩适应(QLoRA)三种微调策略。

Result: 所有微调方法都显著优于基础模型在网络安全问答任务中的表现。LoRA和QLoRA在性能上与SFT相当，但计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 低秩微调策略能够有效弥合通用大型语言模型与领域特定应用之间的差距，为将LLMs适应专门领域提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: 将特征几何结构整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，Procrustes距离和Gram矩阵范数是有效的特征蒸馏损失函数。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

*Yifang Zhang,Pengfei Duan,Henan Wang,Shengwu Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainfallBench是一个专门为降雨临近预报设计的基准测试，包含5年全球12,000多个GNSS站的气象数据，特别包含可降水量水汽(PWV)指标，并评估了20多个最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象时间序列预测基准主要评估温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映降雨临近预报这种更复杂实际场景的模型能力。

Method: 构建RainfallBench数据集，包含6个关键变量15分钟间隔数据；设计专门评估策略评估多尺度预测和极端降雨事件；提出Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster(BFPF)插件模块处理零膨胀和时间衰减问题。

Result: 统计分析和消融研究验证了数据集的全面性和方法的优越性。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准的空白，BFPF模块能有效提升降雨时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Policy Network (PPN)框架，使用强化学习动态选择提示策略，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）存在效率-精度权衡问题，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: PPN将自适应策略选择建模为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO算法训练，通过资源显式奖励函数学习仅在必要时分配高成本推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-精度帕累托前沿上表现优异，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力精度。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了系统性自适应框架，推动了轻量优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

TL;DR: 该研究通过微调天气基础模型，为电力基础设施提供超本地化的资产级天气预报，在多个关键气象变量上超越了现有数值天气预报基准，并实现了对覆冰风险的提前预警能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气基础模型在天气预报准确性方面取得了突破，但其对现代社会关键基础设施的实际价值尚未充分探索。本研究旨在验证天气基础模型在电网韧性智能应用中的潜力。

Method: 使用Hydro-Québec资产观测数据（包括输电线路气象站、风电场气象塔和覆冰传感器）对Silurian AI的15亿参数生成式预报变换器（GFT）进行微调，提供五个关键变量的超本地化预测。

Result: 在6-72小时预报时效内，定制模型显著优于现有数值天气预报基准：温度平均绝对误差降低15%，总降水量误差降低35%，风速误差降低15%。最重要的是，实现了覆冰检测的平均精度得分0.72，提供了数小时的可操作预警时间。

Conclusion: 研究表明，天气基础模型通过少量高保真数据的后训练，可以作为下一代电网韧性智能的实用基础，为关键基础设施提供更准确和实用的天气预报服务。

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出InfMasking方法，通过无限掩码策略增强多模态表示中的协同信息，在七个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值所在

Method: 使用无限掩码策略随机遮挡每个模态的大部分特征，只保留部分信息创建具有不同协同模式的表示，通过互信息最大化对齐未掩码和掩码表示

Result: 在控制实验中有效增强模态间协同信息，在七个大规模真实数据集基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功提升了多模态表示中的协同信息提取能力

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

*Payal Mohapatra,Yueyuan Sui,Akash Pandey,Stephen Xia,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，通过动态跨模态交互、符号化标记和稀疏注意力机制，解决了现有方法对主模态依赖、成对建模和完整观测假设的限制，在完整和部分观测场景下均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法存在三个主要限制：(1)依赖单一主模态进行对齐，(2)成对建模方式，(3)假设完整模态观测。这些限制阻碍了在现实世界多模态时间序列设置中的应用，因为主模态先验不明确、模态数量可能很大、传感器故障导致任意缺失观测。

Method: MAESTRO通过动态模态内和跨模态交互、符号化标记和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，使用稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并通过稀疏混合专家机制实现不同模态组合下的黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上评估，MAESTRO在完整观测下比最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%；在部分观测（高达40%缺失模态）下平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中表现出鲁棒性和高效性，为现实世界多模态应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Result: 深度强化学习框架在动态网络中优化资源分配方面优于启发式算法

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了未来异构无线网络中深度强化学习设计的关键权衡

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel
conditions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that
jointly optimises transmit power, bandwidth, and scheduling via a
multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three
heuristic algorithms in multiple network scenarios. Our results show that DRL
frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for
future HetNets.

TL;DR: ClustRecNet是一个基于深度学习的推荐框架，用于为给定数据集选择最合适的聚类算法，解决了无监督学习中聚类算法选择的长期挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督学习中聚类算法选择的挑战，传统方法依赖手工设计的元特征和聚类有效性指标，效果有限。

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据仓库，使用10种流行聚类算法处理，通过调整兰德指数评估聚类结果作为真实标签。网络架构整合卷积、残差和注意力机制，捕捉数据的局部和全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，该深度学习模型始终优于传统聚类有效性指标（如轮廓系数、Calinski-Harabasz等）和最先进的AutoML聚类推荐方法（如ML2DAC、AutoCluster等）。在合成数据上比Calinski-Harabasz指数提高0.497 ARI，在真实数据上比最佳AutoML方法提高15.3% ARI。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过端到端训练学习数据集的紧凑表示，直接推荐最合适的聚类算法，减少对手工元特征和传统聚类有效性指标的依赖，在聚类算法推荐任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM在强化学习后训练中的扩展规律，发现在固定计算预算下，大模型少步训练优于小模型多步训练；固定数据量时大模型样本效率更高；数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；这些规律在基础模型和指令调优模型中都适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在预训练阶段的扩展规律已被广泛研究，但在强化学习后训练中的行为仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白，特别关注数学推理任务。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统研究模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，分析不同规模模型在不同训练设置下的表现。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：1) 固定计算预算下大模型少步训练更优；2) 固定数据量时大模型样本效率更高；3) 数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；4) 这些规律在不同类型模型中具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导，表明大模型在RL后训练中具有更好的扩展特性。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: LEO-CVAE是一个生成式过采样框架，通过局部熵引导在类别重叠区域生成样本，解决了类别不平衡问题，特别适用于高维生物医学数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，生成的合成样本往往不真实；而深度生成模型如CVAE虽然能更好捕捉非线性分布，但忽视了边界区域样本的重要性。

Method: 提出LEO-CVAE框架，通过计算样本邻域的香农熵来量化不确定性，使用局部熵加权损失强调不确定区域的鲁棒学习，并采用熵引导采样策略在信息丰富的类别重叠区域集中生成样本。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验表明，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样方法和生成式基线方法。

Conclusion: 对于受复杂非线性结构支配的领域（如组学数据），不确定性感知的生成式过采样在类别不平衡学习中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Method: 分析标量-向量分解的梯度下降动力学，推导临界学习率，研究正则化对敏感性的影响，并将分析扩展到一般矩阵分解的正交初始化情况。

Result: 发现临界学习率附近存在混沌区域，长期动态不可预测，且没有简单的隐式偏置（如平衡性、最小范数或平坦性）。正则化会增强敏感性并产生分形边界。

Conclusion: 大学习率下的梯度下降在矩阵分解中会产生分形结构和混沌动力学，解的选择对初始化高度敏感，打破了传统的隐式偏置假设。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

TL;DR: FCRN是一个统一的深度学习框架，用于竞争风险下的离散时间生存分析，能够无缝整合功能协变量并在端到端模型中处理缺失数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重症监护等临床环境中，存在动态风险因素、静态预测因子以及不规则和不完整的数据，需要一种能够有效处理这些复杂情况的生存分析方法。

Method: 结合用于功能数据表示的微网络基础层和基于梯度的插补模块，FCRN同时学习插补缺失值和预测事件特定风险。

Result: 在多个模拟数据集和真实世界ICU案例研究中，FCRN在预测准确性上显著优于随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在GW150914引力波数据上训练的变分自编码器-高斯混合模型（VAE-MoG）的潜在空间，发现尽管模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间表示与真实后验存在明显不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型在引力波数据分析中的潜在空间可靠性，验证强去噪性能是否意味着可靠的潜在表示。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛（HMC）从干净输入中抽取后验样本，并与编码器从噪声数据输出的结果进行比较。

Result: 模型能准确重构信号，但统计比较显示潜在空间存在明显不匹配。

Conclusion: 强去噪性能不一定意味着潜在表示可靠，评估生成模型时应使用基于后验的验证方法。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

TL;DR: mixsemble是一种集成方法，将Dawid-Skene模型应用于多个基于模型的聚类算法预测聚合，将聚类输出视为噪声标注进行建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实数据结构未知的情况下，需要一种稳健的方法来整合多个聚类算法的结果，避免单一算法可能产生的较差结果，特别适合非专业用户使用。

Method: 将Dawid-Skene模型（传统用于众包标注聚合）适应到聚类算法集成中，将不同聚类算法的输出建模为噪声标注进行整合。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，mixsemble虽然不是总是表现最佳，但能持续接近最佳结果并避免较差结果，展现出良好的稳健性。

Conclusion: mixsemble提供了一种实用的替代方案，在数据结构未知时能稳健地整合多个聚类算法，特别适合非专业用户使用。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多任务学习的贝叶斯相关向量机方法，用于提高方程发现在不同操作条件下的泛化能力，避免过拟合特定数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方程发现面临的主要挑战是确保识别模型能够泛化到不同操作条件，而不是过拟合特定数据集。特别是在结构健康监测中，不同载荷条件可能揭示系统物理的不同方面。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架下的贝叶斯相关向量机，将同一结构在不同激励水平下的响应视为相关任务，共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。

Result: 与标准单任务RVM相比，MTL-RVM能够结合跨任务信息，在弱激励和中度激励条件下显著改善参数恢复性能，同时在强激励条件下保持良好表现。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断可以有效缓解方程发现中的过拟合问题，促进模型泛化能力，特别适用于结构健康监测等需要处理变化载荷条件的应用场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，通过灵活的稀疏符号标准化各种稀疏策略表示，在单一注意力内核中执行多样化稀疏计算，显著加速多模态扩散变换器的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但计算需求巨大限制了部署。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，缺乏通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs用于注意力块，利用稀疏符号消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中达到2.5-3.8倍加速(峰值达到理论极限的87.5%)。应用多粒度稀疏策略，使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用的稀疏计算解决方案，能够有效加速DiT模型推理，同时保持视觉质量，解决了现有稀疏方法需要定制化内核的局限性。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA方法，通过不对称的多LoRA设计，在多个A矩阵的情况下共享单个B矩阵，以提高多任务微调和联邦学习中的性能平衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这种相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传输中起着更关键的作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA：在多任务微调中使用多个A矩阵和单个共享B矩阵的不对称多LoRA设计；Fed-ALoRA：在联邦微调中跨客户端共享B矩阵，通过新颖的矩阵分解策略适应客户端间的异构秩。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持可比或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了跨任务更平衡的性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过不对称的LoRA设计有效提升了多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡，验证了B矩阵在知识编码中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对时序图神经网络的新型黑盒攻击框架HIA，通过识别结构重要性和动态重要性节点，结合边注入和删除策略，显著降低TGNN性能，同时保持攻击隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序图神经网络对抗攻击方法依赖简单扰动，无法有效利用时间维度，且容易被检测。需要开发更智能的攻击方法来暴露TGNN的关键脆弱性。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略（边注入和边删除），最小化扰动数量以增强隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4种TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低了链接预测任务的准确性，MRR最多下降35.55%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: HIA暴露了当前STDG模型的基本脆弱性，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时间动态的鲁棒防御的紧迫性。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLFT中策略多样性丧失的问题，防止策略收敛到少数易被利用的输出，从而阻碍探索和限制测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 使用藤蔓采样收集策略内轨迹，并修改优势函数以反映新目标下的优势。基于近端策略优化（PPO）进行适配。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法提高了成功率，能可靠解决更多环境配置，在大的扰动下泛化更好，且在pass@k实验中实现更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法能够维持和利用多样化的策略库，有效防止策略崩溃，提升强化学习微调的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控（LPM）的新方法，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性来指导探索，有效避免智能体被环境中的不可学习随机噪声（noisy-TV）困住。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于内在奖励的探索方法在面对不可学习的随机噪声源时会被困住，而基于不确定性估计或分布相似性的方法虽然最终能逃脱，但样本效率低且计算成本高。受神经科学发现启发，人类在探索过程中会监控自己的进步。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在前一次迭代中的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与前一迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM是一种概念简单但有效的方法，标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，能够奖励智能体观察可学习的转换而非不可学习的转换。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

Motivation: 神经符号应用结合了神经网络和符号推理的优势，但存在计算密集、数据传输量大和性能受限的问题。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，通过降低数据位宽实现模型压缩。

Result: Norm-Q相比传统量化方法实现了更高的压缩率和合理的分数损失，在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率可达99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法有效解决了概率符号模型的内存和带宽瓶颈问题，为在定制硬件上部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入开发未来时间序列基础模型奠定了基础，展示了TS-JEPA作为学习通用表示的稳健框架的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Motivation: 通用机器人策略通常需要大量专家数据或模拟训练，本文旨在开发一种数据高效的方法来学习多任务策略。

Method: 使用性能感知调度策略，基于卡尔曼滤波估计器跟踪每个任务从数据量中获益的程度，从而决定如何在任务间分配额外演示。

Result: 在MetaWorld和IsaacLab的抽屉开启任务套件上验证，所得策略在所有任务上都达到高性能，同时使用显著更少的专家演示，且视觉策略在零样本迁移到真实机器人时表现优于朴素DAgger和行为克隆。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效学习多任务策略，减少对专家数据的依赖，并在模拟到真实的迁移中表现出色。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有STL推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统符合预测通常作为训练后包装器使用，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非一致性评分，将平滑CP层直接嵌入训练过程，使用同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集的损失函数，训练后执行精确CP程序。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测不确定性（实现高覆盖率同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性（使用固定阈值时的误分类数量减少）。

Conclusion: 该端到端可微分CP框架增强了STL推理的可靠性和可解释性，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统需要复杂的多电极设置，限制了移动监测应用，而当前基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es框架，包含三个关键创新：前向过程使用频率域模糊和时间噪声干扰模拟真实信号失真；反向过程采用时间多尺度生成和频率去模糊；利用KNN聚类和对比学习为反向过程分配亲和矩阵，实现人口统计学特定的ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联ECG，为移动心血管监测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了Mole-PAIR方法，通过偏好优化提升分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性，显著改善OOD检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，特别是在药物发现和蛋白质设计等高风险领域存在化学幻觉问题，需要提高模型可靠性。

Method: Mole-PAIR是一个即插即用模块，通过成对学习目标优化ID和OOD样本之间的OOD亲和度估计，本质上优化AUROC指标。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在尺寸、支架和测定分布偏移下AUROC分别提升45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR能够有效提升分子基础模型在分布外数据上的可靠性，为高风险科学应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

TL;DR: EEsizer是一个基于大语言模型的AI代理，通过集成LLM与电路仿真器和数据分析功能，实现全自动闭环晶体管尺寸优化，无需外部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟和混合信号集成电路设计中的晶体管尺寸优化过程需要大量人工努力，现有机器学习方法存在迭代次数多和缺乏电路设计知识的问题。

Method: 使用提示工程和思维链推理，集成大语言模型与电路仿真器，通过迭代探索设计方向、评估性能和优化解决方案。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的AI代理能够有效自动化晶体管尺寸优化过程，减少人工干预，并在先进工艺节点上表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Motivation: 机械取栓术的自主导航面临血管解剖复杂性和实时决策精度挑战，现有RL方法在多患者血管泛化和长时程任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用TD-MPC2模型基强化学习算法构建世界模型，在10个真实患者血管数据上训练单一智能体，并与SAC方法进行对比。

Result: TD-MPC2在多任务学习中显著优于SAC，平均成功率65% vs 37%，路径比有显著改善，但手术时间增加。

Conclusion: 世界模型在改善自主血管内导航方面具有潜力，为未来可泛化AI驱动机器人干预研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种半离散流匹配方法（SD-FM），通过解决半离散最优传输问题来改进流匹配训练，避免了传统OT-FM方法的二次计算复杂度瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OT-FM方法虽然在理论上很有前景，但在实践中由于Sinkhorn算法的高计算成本（O(n²/ε²)）而难以广泛应用，特别是在需要大批量训练时。

Method: 采用半离散最优传输公式，通过SGD估计对偶势向量，然后使用最大内积搜索将新采样的噪声向量与数据点匹配，消除了对n/ε的二次依赖。

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下都优于FM和OT-FM，在多个数据集、无条件/条件生成以及使用均值流模型时都表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配方法有效地解决了OT-FM的计算瓶颈问题，为流匹配训练提供了一种更高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

TL;DR: 提出一种因果推理框架来训练LLM路由器，通过结合黄金标准数据和偏好数据，校正偏好数据中的偏差，改善路由准确性和成本-质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。LLM路由器可以从候选池中选择最合适的模型，但训练高质量路由器的核心挑战是缺乏可靠的监督数据。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推理框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配。基于这一新视角，开发了集成因果路由器训练框架，校正偏好数据偏差，解决两个数据源之间的不平衡问题。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能提供更准确的路由，并改善了成本与质量之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 通过因果推理框架整合黄金标准和偏好数据，可以有效校正偏好数据偏差，提高LLM路由器的性能和效率。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Conclusion: 结合主动学习可以防止生成式AI工作流在无意义候选上浪费资源，避免生成模型退化，显著提升高质量候选的发现效率

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: FedIF为现实世界部署提供了一个实用、理论可靠且可扩展的联邦学习鲁棒聚合替代方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

Motivation: 现有的上下文强化学习专注于性能提升，但缺乏对安全约束的考虑，需要在无参数更新的适应过程中确保智能体行为的安全性。

Method: 在约束马尔可夫决策过程框架下，通过扩展策略神经网络的输入上下文来包含历史经验，使智能体在适应过程中同时优化奖励和成本函数。

Result: 智能体能够根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为：成本预算较高时行为更激进，成本预算较低时行为更保守。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了上下文强化学习的安全适应，使智能体能够在无参数更新的情况下根据安全约束动态调整行为策略。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

Conclusion: 机器学习和强化学习将经典的不精确求解器转变为更可扩展、鲁棒和自适应的现实世界优化框架。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

TL;DR: 提出二元稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二元转码器(BTC)，通过将激活值限制为0或1来提升特征的单一语义性和可解释性，但会增加重构误差和超高频特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器(SAE)的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，连续激活变化可能携带不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二元稀疏自编码器和二元转码器，约束所有激活值为0或1，消除连续激活强度的变化。

Result: 二元化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单一语义性，但增加了重构误差和超高频不可解释特征的数量。

Conclusion: 多语义性可能是神经网络激活的固有属性，二元化虽然改善了可解释性，但频率调整后的评分显示连续稀疏编码器略优。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

TL;DR: EMP是一种与上下文无关、无需参数的剪枝规则，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定保留多少参数，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型剪枝中的核心问题：应该保留多少参数？现有方法通常需要手动设置阈值或依赖特定上下文，缺乏通用性。

Method: 基于逆辛普森指数计算有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，零化其余参数。该方法可应用于权重大小、注意力分数、KAN重要性分数等多种剪枝标准。

Result: 在MLP、CNN、Transformer/LLM和KAN等模型上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个通用且自适应的剪枝阈值，无需手动调参，在保持模型性能的同时实现有效剪枝，β=1时效果最佳。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

Conclusion: T-BiGAN展示了在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下实现实时广域监测的实用价值，为电网异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

TL;DR: D-Rank是一个基于SVD的LLM压缩框架，通过层间动态秩分配来优化压缩效果，相比均匀压缩方法能显著降低困惑度并提高推理精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩率，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异（中间层信息更丰富，首尾层更冗余），导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: 引入有效秩作为信息密度度量，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，为高信息密度层分配更多容量，并针对注意力层的重要性重新平衡秩分配。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩率下，D-Rank持续优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing方法，在20%压缩率下LLaMA-3-8B的困惑度降低15%以上，在40%压缩率下LLaMA-7B的零样本推理精度提高5%。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间异质性的动态秩分配，显著提升了SVD压缩效果，在保持高吞吐量的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Swift是一种单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于CRPS目标的自回归微调概率流模型，无需多模型集成或参数扰动，在S2S天气预报中比现有扩散模型快39倍，且预报技能与IFS ENS相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其典型的缓慢迭代推理方法不适用于需要长预报时效和领域驱动校准的次季节到季节(S2S)应用。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于连续排序概率评分(CRPS)目标的自回归微调概率流模型，消除了对多模型集成或参数扰动的需求。

Result: Swift生成的6小时预报在长达75天内保持稳定，运行速度比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，预报技能与基于数值的IFS ENS相当。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集合预报迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

*Kotaro Yoshida,Atsushi Nitanda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了预条件处理如何通过Gram矩阵引入可控的谱偏置，影响特征学习和泛化性能。研究发现预条件器的指数p和教师模型与输入谱的对齐是关键因素，这种谱偏置会影响噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预条件处理在机器学习中被广泛用于加速经验风险的收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，在单索引教师模型框架下，分析预条件处理如何通过Gram矩阵引入谱偏置，并从噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移三个互补视角研究特征学习。

Result: 学习到的特征表示紧密反映了预条件器引入的谱偏置——偏好被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件表现出降低的敏感性。当这种谱偏置与教师的谱偏置对齐时，泛化性能显著增强。

Conclusion: 预条件处理通过控制谱偏置显著影响特征学习和泛化性能，关键在于预条件器的指数p和教师模型与输入谱的对齐程度，这种对齐能有效提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

TL;DR: 提出UQ-SONet，一种具有内置不确定性量化的置换不变算子学习框架，解决DeepONets在传感器约束和不确定性量化方面的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DeepONets需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，而现有扩展如VIDON虽然放宽了传感器约束，但仍无法处理不完整测量或算子固有随机性带来的不确定性

Method: 集成set transformer嵌入处理稀疏可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器(cVAE)逼近解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO提供原则性不确定性估计

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了算子学习中传感器约束和不确定性量化的关键挑战

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 将确定性神经网络验证中的分支定界预激活分裂框架扩展到概率设置

Method: 提出BaB-prob方法，通过分裂预激活将原问题划分为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算线性边界来界定每个子问题的概率

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，该方法在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于最先进方法

Conclusion: BaB-prob为概率神经网络验证提供了有效解决方案，在多个数据集和基准测试中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

*Qihang Yao,Constantine Dovrolis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过增长网络而非剪枝，自动发现最佳密度，以较低成本接近彩票假设的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先确定目标密度

Method: 从稀疏种子开始，基于路径核启发式分数添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，使用逻辑拟合规则检测精度平台期来停止增长

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验显示，PWMPR以显著更低的成本（约1.5倍稠密训练vs IMP的3-4倍）接近IMP彩票的性能，尽管密度更高

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NuRL是一种通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理能力上限的新方法，解决了现有RL算法无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线强化学习算法如GRPO存在关键限制：无法从模型"无法解决"的问题中学习，只能改进模型已有能力范围内的问题，导致模型的上限无法提升。

Method: 提出NuRL方法：模型生成包含问题核心知识的提示，对于通过率为0%的困难样本注入提示并重新生成轨迹，从而为之前无法学习的样本引入训练信号。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上实现了一致的改进，能够提升模型的上限，而GRPO则无法改变pass@1024指标。

Conclusion: 最有效的提示是抽象且高层次的，在GRPO收敛后必要地应用时最为有益，NuRL方法能够突破LLM推理的上限限制。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由机制忽略了模态间信息丰富的时序交互动态，这限制了专家专业化，因为模型无法显式利用内在模态关系进行有效推理。

Method: 提出多模态交互感知路由器，基于token的交互特性将其分配到专家；构建时序多模态交互动态的新公式，用于指导专家路由。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多模态基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，展示了性能提升和改进的可解释性。

Conclusion: 时序多模态交互揭示了跨应用的有意义模式，可用于改进MoE模型的设计和性能，动态路由鼓励专家获得可泛化的交互处理技能而非仅学习任务特定特征。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Result: 生成的最小解释不仅保留了模型决策，而且简洁可读，同时通过电路读出提供了对模型内部计算的机制化理解。

Conclusion: 该方法在最小输入级解释和驱动模型决策的内部计算的机制化理解之间建立了实用桥梁。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain

efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K

a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能成功使用伪标签训练，还能通过利用大量未标注数据超越VLM本身的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据不足的问题，展示了伪标签训练的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Motivation: 随着现实世界图的规模不断增大，直接处理变得越来越困难甚至不可行。针对大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练GNN并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中合并节点，而不是作为预处理步骤。

Result: 在同类性和异类性节点分类数据集上验证了该方法，并通过可视化节点嵌入与其对应聚类的关系，说明粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够适应学习任务，特别适用于其他方法难以处理的场景，如异类性数据。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

TL;DR: Expert Merging是一种轻量训练方法，通过层间系数学习和重要性引导分块技术，实现多专家模型的标签无关、参数高效合并，在LLM和MLLM上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法存在局限性：无训练方法依赖手动调参，训练方法主要对齐参数而非下游任务行为，且通常忽略层间异质性。需要一种更有效的多专家模型合并方案。

Method: 提出Expert Merging方法：使用未标注校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和对数对齐优化，加入系数正则化和任务加权损失。Expert Merging++进一步引入重要性引导分块，根据重要性指标为高重要性层分配更多系数。

Result: 在InternVL、Qwen2-VL和Mistral等骨干网络上，该方法超越了强基线方法，Expert Merging++在某些情况下甚至超过监督混合训练。

Conclusion: Expert Merging提供了一种标签无关、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方案，在LLM和MLLM上表现出色。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

Conclusion: UOT-RFM能够有效缓解多数类偏差，无需类别标签即可改善尾部类生成质量

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽略了证据间的复杂交互，导致验证结果不可靠。完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和数据偏见两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架整合后门路径和前门路径：后门路径通过优化节点概率权重稀释噪声干扰并增强相关证据连接；前门路径提取相关子图构建推理路径，应用反事实推理消除数据偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，提升了验证的可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: B2R框架通过非对称条件化解决离线安全强化学习中的约束满足问题，将成本到目标重新定义为边界约束，在38个安全关键任务中35个满足安全约束且性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报到目标和成本到目标使用对称输入标记，忽略了它们内在的不对称性：回报到目标是灵活的性能目标，而成本到目标应是严格的安全边界。这种对称条件化导致不可靠的约束满足。

Method: 提出边界到区域(B2R)框架，通过成本信号重新对齐实现非对称条件化，将成本到目标重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布，同时结合旋转位置嵌入增强安全区域内探索。

Result: 实验结果显示B2R在38个安全关键任务中35个满足安全约束，同时实现了优于基线方法的奖励性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件化的局限性，为将序列模型应用于安全强化学习建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛使用，其安全漏洞引起关注。机器遗忘旨在通过移除不良数据影响来降低风险，但现有方法不仅依赖保留数据集来保持模型效用，还在连续遗忘请求下遭受累积的灾难性效用损失。

Method: RCU方法利用旋转显著性权重量化控制连续遗忘过程中的遗忘程度，设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间，通过旋转角度变化模拟连续遗忘过程，并设计正交旋转轴正则化来最小化干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，在不依赖保留数据集的情况下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

TL;DR: OPPO是一个新颖的PPO-based RLHF框架，通过流水线重叠执行提高训练效率，加速1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提升1.4-2.1倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PPO-based RLHF训练管道中存在的效率低下问题，包括顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致的阶段完成延迟。

Method: 提出两种新技术：1）Intra-step overlap - 流式传输上游模型输出，使下游模型能提前开始预填充；2）Inter-step overlap - 自适应超量提交提示并延迟长生成，缓解尾部延迟。

Result: OPPO将PPO-based RLHF训练加速1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提升1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个轻量级、模型无关的框架，只需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中，显著提高训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

TL;DR: 提出了一个自主感知聚类框架，通过强化学习和确定性退火相结合的方法，在不需要先验知识的情况下学习并考虑实体局部自主性对聚类结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法假设实体是被动的，但现实中实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖指定的关联，这会显著改变聚类结果，影响下游推理和决策。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火过程，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出了自适应距离估计网络（ADEN），这是一个基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式的自主性模型，该框架也能接近真实结果（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致更大的差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能够有效捕捉数据动态，显著提高聚类性能，特别是在存在实体自主性的场景下。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，决策代理能够在在线学习过程中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常会产生成本，需要与潜在收益进行权衡。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成，平衡利用、探索和创建之间的三角权衡。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法相比基线策略实现了更好的生成-质量权衡。理论分析证明算法达到了O(T^(d/(d+2))d^(d/(d+2)) + d√(TlogT))的最优遗憾界。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有扩展动作空间的在线学习提供了首个次线性遗憾界，有效解决了动作生成成本与收益的平衡问题。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RA3算法，通过中期训练构建动作抽象空间，提升大语言模型在强化学习中的表现，在代码生成任务上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但充分发挥其潜力需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的动作子集并实现快速选择。

Method: 提出RA3算法，通过推导序列变分下界，使用强化学习迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，然后在引导数据上进行微调。

Result: 在多个基础模型上，RA3在HumanEval和MBPP上的平均性能分别比基础模型和下一词预测基线提高了8分和4分，在RLVR中收敛更快且达到更高渐近性能。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最有效，强调在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于完全异步去中心化多玩家多臂老虎机的新算法，通过自适应切换探索和利用来解决玩家碰撞和玩家数量检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界系统通常是去中心化和异步的，玩家可以随时进入或离开系统，且没有全局时钟，这带来了玩家碰撞和玩家数量检测的挑战。

Method: 开发了一种算法，玩家在探索和利用之间自适应切换。探索时均匀拉动臂以减少碰撞概率，同时以较小概率继续拉动其他玩家正在利用的臂来检测玩家离开。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾界，其中$\Delta$是任意两个臂之间的最小期望奖励差距。

Conclusion: 这是第一个在异步去中心化环境中高效的多玩家多臂老虎机算法，实验验证了其有效性和鲁棒性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kairos是一个灵活的时间序列基础模型框架，通过动态分块标记化和实例自适应位置嵌入来解决时间序列信息密度不均的问题，在零样本基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列在不同时间段具有不均匀的信息密度，受系统状态和信号复杂度影响，而现有时间序列基础模型使用非自适应处理流程，无法捕捉这种动态特性。

Method: 提出Kairos框架，包含动态分块标记化器和实例自适应位置嵌入，根据每个时间序列实例的独特特征自适应选择标记化粒度和定制位置编码。

Result: 在包含3000亿时间点的大规模可预测性分层时间序列语料库上训练，并在GIFT-Eval和Time-Series-Library两个零样本基准测试中，以更少的参数实现了优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Kairos通过自适应处理策略有效解决了时间序列信息密度不均的挑战，在零样本场景下表现出色，为时间序列分析提供了更灵活的基础模型框架。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强策略，通过生成语义不一致的多模态错位样本来解决模态不平衡问题，结合弱模态加权和难样本加权机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态而无法达到最优性能，现有方法主要关注训练目标或优化过程，数据中心的解决方案探索不足。

Method: 提出MIDAS数据增强策略：1)生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2)使用单模态置信度进行标注；3)引入弱模态加权机制动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4)提出难样本加权机制优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试中，MIDAS显著优于相关基线方法，有效解决了模态不平衡问题。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据中心的错位样本生成和双重加权机制，成功解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法存在softmax平滑导致logit信息丢失，以及直接logit蒸馏受限于logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出CSD方法，解决自回归LLM中离散分数匹配的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题，通过灵活加权对齐学生和教师在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越现有KD方法，实现更好的保真度-多样性权衡，与在线策略技术结合产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了在LLM蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为高效推理提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向模糊决策系统的空间感知可分性特征选择方法S²FS，通过整合空间方向信息来改善决策边界清晰度，在分类和聚类性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么未能直接对齐评估标准与学习性能，要么仅依赖无方向的欧氏距离来捕捉决策类间关系，这限制了它们澄清决策边界的能力。而实例的空间分布对决策边界的清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出了空间感知可分性驱动的特征选择框架S²FS，采用前向贪心策略迭代选择最具判别性的特征，综合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，整合标量距离与空间方向信息。

Result: 在10个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，S²FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上持续优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S²FS通过整合空间方向信息提供更全面的类别结构表征，能够有效提升模糊决策系统的预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，解决了LLM自改进中均匀分配导致的梯度消失问题，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自改进方法采用均匀探索预算分配，导致简单任务持续成功而困难任务持续失败，两者在GRPO训练中都产生零梯度，影响学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO中，该方法将非零策略梯度的有效比例提高了20-40%，特别困难问题的探索预算可达93次rollout，在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务上，相比传统均匀分配，达到相同性能只需约一半的计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Motivation: 解决LLM微调中的数据选择问题，将其重新表述为预算约束优化问题，旨在最大化下游性能同时严格限制训练数据量。

Method: 将数据选择问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用各种强化学习方法训练智能体学习最优数据选择策略，通过基于代理模型的高效奖励信号进行指导。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，使用该方法选择的5%子集进行微调，性能可媲美甚至超越全数据集微调，准确率最高提升10.8个百分点，同时训练时间减少2倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法在LLM微调中具有显著优势，能够在严格数据预算下实现优异性能，同时大幅提升训练效率。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为强化策略梯度学习提供了一种实用有效的方法，并为代理目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

Motivation: 联邦学习中使用差分隐私保护客户端数据时，添加的噪声会显著降低模型精度，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析表明MS-PAFL显著减少满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声，实验验证其能持续获得优越的隐私-效用权衡，在强隐私保证下训练高精度模型。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL框架通过模型分割和隐私放大技术，有效解决了联邦学习中差分隐私噪声与模型精度之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于自主拉曼光谱分类的完整工作流程，包括在原始光谱上训练、调整池化参数、在标签稀缺时添加半监督学习以及轻量级微调新目标，为自主探索中的稳健、低资源拉曼分类提供了实用路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星车、深海着陆器和现场机器人等自主设备中拉曼光谱分析面临的挑战：荧光基线失真、峰位移和有限的地面真值标签。

Method: 使用RRUFF数据库的精选子集，评估一维卷积神经网络（CNN），包括基线无关分类、池化控制鲁棒性、标签高效学习和恒定时间自适应等方法。

Result: 紧凑CNN在手工特征上超越k近邻和支持向量机；通过调整单个池化参数可适应高达30 cm⁻¹的拉曼位移；半监督生成对抗网络和对比预训练在仅10%标签下将准确率提高达11%；冻结CNN主干并仅重新训练softmax层可在恒定时间内适应新矿物。

Conclusion: 该工作流程为自主探索中的稳健、低资源拉曼分类提供了实用解决方案，特别适用于资源受限的处理器和标签稀缺的环境。

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

TL;DR: CAST是一种完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，用于半结构化稀疏模型，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，显著减少推理延迟和内存消耗。


<details>

Motivation: 稀疏感知训练可以将大语言模型转换为硬件友好的稀疏模式，但现有方法分别优化稀疏模式和权重，无法实现无缝联合优化。

Method: CAST包含三个关键组件：AdamS优化器（使用自适应L1衰减促进均匀稀疏化）、权重缩放模块（缓解衰减引起的幅度减少）和知识蒸馏（使用稠密模型作为自教师）。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数的多个模型上，CAST在困惑度和零样本准确率上显著优于现有方法。LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅使用2%原始预训练token，困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST框架能够高效训练高质量稀疏模型，建立了可预测稀疏模型性能的扩展定律，并在量化和微调场景中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Conclusion: 挑战了完全状态访问的必要性，为非对称强化学习方法的设计开辟了新方向，使其既实用又理论可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Motivation: 研究注意力机制在键值对来自不同序列或模态时的表现，特别是在存在噪声值特征和上下文错位情况下的性能问题。

Method: 首先分析注意力机制在噪声值特征下的行为，建立临界噪声阈值；然后将上下文错位建模为结构化噪声；最后提出间接注意力机制来处理错位情况。

Result: 证明了上下文错位引起的噪声会显著超过临界阈值，从而损害标准注意力机制的有效性；间接注意力机制在合成任务和实际应用中表现出更好的错位处理能力。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能够有效处理键值对错位情况，在存在上下文错位的场景中优于标准注意力机制。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾数据分布下能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释Muon优化器相比Adam在训练大语言模型时性能更优的机制，特别是在重尾数据分布下的表现。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Transformer组件，从关联记忆角度解释Muon的优势，并建立理论模型分析类别不平衡数据下的学习行为。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据中能更有效地优化尾部类别，理论分析证实Muon能实现跨类别的平衡学习。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，在重尾分布下比Adam能更平衡有效地学习尾部类别。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Conclusion: DPSBA通过抑制结构和语义异常，实现了高攻击成功率和显著改善的隐蔽性，为图神经网络后门攻击提供了更隐蔽的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均有效解决了时序域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型对未来域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，它独立影响熵并进而影响推理行为。通过有意识地使用裁剪可以控制熵，防止熵崩溃，促进探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于宏基因组分箱的概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，解决了确定性方法无法捕捉DNA序列不确定性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有宏基因组分箱方法依赖确定性表示（如k-mer图谱或大语言模型嵌入），无法捕捉DNA序列中固有的不确定性，这些不确定性源于物种间DNA共享和具有高度相似表示的片段。

Method: 开发了概率嵌入方法UncertainGen，将每个DNA片段表示为潜在空间中的概率分布，引入数据自适应度量来扩展可行潜在空间，从而实现更灵活的分箱/聚类分离。

Result: 在真实宏基因组数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分箱任务上优于确定性k-mer和基于LLM的嵌入方法，为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展的轻量级解决方案。

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架能够自然建模序列级不确定性，提供嵌入可区分性的理论保证，在宏基因组分箱任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

TL;DR: 本文分析了超维计算(HDC)在智能制造中的应用，发现HDC超参数与性能的关系在不同应用中并不稳定。通过信号质量监控和图像缺陷检测两个代表性任务，揭示了编码器类型、投影方差、超维维度和数据制度对性能的影响规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造需要满足严格延迟和能耗预算的设备端智能。HDC通过将数据编码为高维超向量并提供轻量级计算，成为深度学习的轻量级替代方案。但先前研究假设HDC超参数与性能的定性关系在不同应用中稳定，这一假设需要验证。

Method: 在两个代表性任务上分析HDC：CNC加工中的信号质量监控和LPBF中的图像缺陷检测。映射编码器类型、投影方差、超维维度和数据制度对准确性、推理延迟、训练时间和训练能量的影响。建立形式化复杂度模型解释可预测趋势。

Result: 信号任务偏好非线性随机傅里叶特征编码，图像任务偏好线性随机投影编码。调优后的HDC模型在匹配或超越最先进深度学习和Transformer模型精度的同时，提供至少6倍更快的推理速度和40倍更低的训练能耗。

Conclusion: 领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，调优后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了实用、可扩展的路径。未来工作将实现自适应编码器和超参数选择，扩展到更多制造模式，并在低功耗加速器上验证。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Conclusion: 该方法通过机器学习加速、优化减少模拟次数和智能管理框架，显著提高了火灾模拟的效率和实用性。

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型的对齐仍然是自然语言处理中的核心挑战，现有偏好优化方法通常需要在训练时或通过提示进行干预，缺乏在推理阶段直接提升对齐效果的方法。

Method: 引入对齐感知解码(AAD)，在推理阶段直接增强模型对齐，该方法可解释为隐式奖励优化，但只需要标准的DPO设置，无需专门训练。

Result: AAD在不同对齐基准测试和模型规模上始终优于强基线方法，在数据受限情况下能生成高质量合成数据来改进标准解码下的对齐效果。

Conclusion: AAD为模型对齐提供了一种实用的推理阶段解决方案，特别是在标注数据有限的情况下，能够有效提升模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Motivation: 现有方法将空间单元独立处理，忽略了城市结构的关系特性，需要更有效地利用地理上下文信息来改进非正式住区映射。

Method: 构建图结构将每个空间单元与其相邻单元连接，使用轻量级图卷积网络对中心单元是否属于非正式住区进行分类。

Conclusion: 图建模能够有效编码空间结构，为城市场景理解提供优势，证明了地理上下文整合对非正式住区检测的重要性。

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有的神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），往往过度平滑局部动态且计算成本高。FINO旨在通过严格局部性解决这些问题。

Method: FINO使用可学习的卷积核替代固定有限差分系数，通过局部算子块（包含微分模板层、门控掩码和线性融合步骤）构建自适应导数类局部特征，采用编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在6个基准测试和气候建模任务中，FINO相比最先进的算子学习方法误差降低达44%，速度提升约2倍。

Conclusion: 严格的局部性与可学习时间步进相结合，为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

Method: 利用ROBOD数据集，比较了LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构在不同时间跨度下预测室内环境质量变量的性能。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳且计算开销较低，CNN-LSTM在长期预测中能更好地提取主导特征，LSTM在长期时间建模方面表现稳健。预测可靠性受数据分辨率、传感器位置和人员流动影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统提供了实施预测性HVAC控制的可行见解，有助于在实际建筑运营中降低能耗并提升居住者舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理缓慢、似然近似、模式崩溃或双射映射等架构限制，需要一种能同时克服这些局限的框架

Method: 定义模型qθ(x)通过参数化分布q(x|w)和潜在参数w，通过从可学习分布qθ(w)中采样w来边缘化潜在变量，实现高效密度评估和采样

Result: 模型支持精确密度评估，训练和推理速度比竞争模型快几个数量级，能够学习低维流形上的分布，处理多模态目标，在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布等任务上表现优异

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个灵活框架，不限制神经网络架构，能高效学习各种目标分布，在多个任务上展现出卓越性能

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练虽能部分缓解，但过短的初始上下文会导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: 引入TFPI方法，通过ThinkFree操作（直接附加</think>标记）显式丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用。在ThinkFree适应的输入上进行训练，即使在原始慢思考模式下也能提升性能和降低token消耗。

Result: 实验表明TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到了更高的性能上限，并产生了更token高效的原因模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计的简单方法，能有效提升RLVR的性能和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Motivation: 快速充电过程中的锂析出是导致容量衰减和安全故障的关键机制。传统dQ/dV计算方法依赖有限差分和滤波，会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架直接建模电荷-电压关系Q(V)作为随机过程，利用GP导数仍是GP的特性，从后验分布中解析地概率推断dQ/dV，无需经验平滑处理。

Result: 在0.2C-1C倍率和0-40°C温度范围的锂离子纽扣电池实验中，GP方法能可靠检测低温高倍率充电下的析锂峰值，在基准情况下正确报告无峰值，与参考性能测试结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了实时锂析检测的实用途径，具有噪声感知推理、闭式导数不确定性量化以及适合嵌入式BMS的在线变体等关键优势。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了截断多项式分类器(TPCs)，用于动态激活监控，通过逐项评估多项式实现灵活的安全监控，既能在简单输入时节省计算资源，又能在复杂输入时提供更强的安全保障。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对每个查询使用相同计算量，导致在简单输入上浪费资源或在复杂输入上检测失败。需要一种灵活的安全监控方法，计算成本仅在实际需要时增加。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，通过逐项训练和评估多项式实现渐进式监控。测试时可提前停止进行轻量监控，或使用更多项获得更强保护。提供两种使用模式：安全调节和自适应级联。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集(WildGuardMix和BeaverTails)上，对4个参数高达300亿的模型进行测试，TPCs在相同规模下与MLP探针基线竞争或表现更优，同时比黑盒方法更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供了一种灵活高效的安全监控方案，能够在保证检测性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为开发者和监管者提供了可调节的安全保障机制。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒的群体公平性认证框架，能够在分布偏移下提供最坏情况下的公平性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈，影响审计的可靠性。需要一种能够认证最坏情况下公平性的方法。

Method: 使用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，通过强对偶性推导出可处理的重新表述和高效估计器DRUNE。

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准和分类器上提供了稳定的公平性评估，在分布偏移下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了理论基础，能够提供分布偏移下的公平性保证。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Method: 从因果和个体公平角度构建DRO问题，提出DRO对偶形式，将问题转化为更易处理的形式，推导近似最坏情况损失的闭式正则化器，并在未知因果模型下使用经验分布和估计的因果结构。

Result: 成功将DRO min-max问题转化为带正则化的优化问题，消除了最大步，提供了有限样本误差界，确保高效和鲁棒学习。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了因果结构下的个体公平性问题，通过DRO框架提供了理论保证和计算效率，拓展了分布鲁棒优化在公平机器学习中的应用。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

*Anthony Zhou,Alexander Wikner,Amaury Lancelin,Pedram Hassanzadeh,Amir Barati Farimani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了不同生成模型在物理系统模拟中的表现，发现随机插值方法相比基于高斯去噪的方法在自回归预测任务中表现更优，能够用更少的采样步骤获得更准确的预测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数生成模型依赖高斯去噪方法，但这在PDE和动力系统（如气候）的自回归预测任务中可能不是最有效的选择。需要寻找更适合物理系统模拟的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值方法，直接学习当前状态和未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的邻近性。通过调整采样策略来平衡确定性精度、谱一致性和概率校准。

Result: 随机插值方法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型使用更少的采样步骤，产生更准确的预测。在不同物理领域和任务中的实验表明该方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 随机插值方法为物理仿真提供了一个有竞争力的基准，并揭示了不同生成建模框架的能力差异。生成模型需要在确定性精度、谱一致性和概率校准之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NGT是一种轻量级离线策略方法，将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练解决，在极低数据条件下（仅20个转换）表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模仿学习在低数据环境下的挑战，传统方法依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构难以应用，需要高效利用有限专家演示数据。

Method: 将模仿学习转化为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计，实现简单易调。

Result: 在具有挑战性的连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）上表现强劲，在极低数据条件下仅需20个转换即可有效学习。

Conclusion: NGT提供了一种简单高效的模仿学习方法，在低数据环境下具有显著优势，易于实现和调整。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/lionelblonde/ngt-pytorch.

*Floris-Jan Willemsen,Rob V. van Nieuwpoort,Ben van Werkhoven*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于自动性能调优中优化算法超参数调优的新方法，通过统计评估、数据重用和模拟模式，显著降低了调优成本并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优中优化算法的超参数几乎从未被调优过，但其对性能有重要影响，目前缺乏系统研究。

Method: 提出跨搜索空间的稳健统计评估方法，建立FAIR数据集和软件，引入模拟模式重用历史调优数据，降低调优成本两个数量级。

Result: 有限的超参数调优可使自动调优器性能平均提升94.8%，使用元策略优化超参数可平均提升204.7%。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是提升自动调优研究和实践效力的强大技术，但常被忽视。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段对齐策略，通过领域特定自监督微调（NeuroTTT）和测试时训练（TTT）来解决EEG基础模型在预训练目标与下游任务之间的不对齐问题，显著提升脑机接口任务的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模EEG信号基础模型在脑机接口应用中存在预训练目标与下游任务不对齐以及跨受试者分布偏移的问题，需要一种能够弥合通用预训练与特定EEG解码任务之间差距的方法。

Method: 两阶段对齐策略：1）NeuroTTT：领域特定自监督微调，通过自监督目标将潜在表示对齐到重要的频谱、空间和时间EEG特征；2）测试时训练：在推理时对单个未标记测试样本进行自监督训练，并使用预测熵最小化（Tent）动态校准模型。

Result: 在三个不同的脑机接口任务（想象语音、压力检测、运动想象）上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于传统的微调和适应方法，使用CBraMod和LaBraM作为骨干网络将性能提升到显著更高的水平。

Conclusion: 该研究首次将领域调优的自监督与测试时训练统一应用于大规模EEG基础模型，证明了所提出的对齐策略能够有效解决模型不对齐问题，为可泛化的脑机接口应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

*Piotr Komorowski,Elena Golimblevskaia,Reduan Achtibat,Thomas Wiegand,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的解码策略——归因引导解码(AGD)，通过选择对用户定义感兴趣区域(ROI)具有最高归因的token候选，来增强LLMs的指令遵循能力和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令和生成事实准确文本方面存在不足，现有控制技术又常常降低输出质量，需要一种更稳健的解码策略。

Method: AGD考虑一组高概率输出token候选，选择对用户定义ROI具有最高归因的token。ROI可以灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件的不同部分，支持自适应熵基变体以减少计算开销。

Result: 在指令遵循方面显著提升成功率（Llama 3.1从66.0%提升至79.1%）；在知识密集型任务中减少幻觉并提高事实准确性；自适应变体缓解质量下降。

Conclusion: AGD是一种多功能、更可解释且有效的方法，可增强现代LLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际优化场景中，当计算预算充足时，可以尝试多种启发式方法来解决同一问题，但如何顺序选择这些方法以获得最佳解尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 通过统一术语和共同框架，将算法选择、参数调优、多起点和资源分配等策略整合，并开发分类法来系统组织和分类这些策略。

Result: 提出了一个统一的框架和分类法，能够系统地组织和比较不同顺序选择策略，填补了该领域缺乏全面综述的空白。

Conclusion: 该工作为单问题多尝试启发式优化提供了系统的综述框架，有助于更有效地选择最佳优化策略。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

*Margarita A. Guerrero,Cristian R. Rojas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ACE算法，通过贝叶斯估计和随机优化结合自适应采样，用更少查询次数高效逼近决策边界，生成反事实解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法样本效率低，需要大量黑盒模型评估，成本高且不实用

Method: 结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化的自适应采样算法，优先选择信息量大的点来最小化评估次数

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有最先进方法，同时保持识别最小可行变化的能力

Conclusion: ACE算法显著提高了反事实解释的样本效率，为黑盒模型解释提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何将基于线性最小化预言机(LMO)的Muon优化方法应用于联邦学习，提出了FedMuon算法来解决直接使用Muon不收敛的问题，并分析了近似求解LMO对收敛速度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon作为一种基于LMO的新优化方法，在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快，但直接应用于联邦学习中的FedAvg本地优化器会导致不收敛问题，因为LMO是有偏算子。

Method: 提出FedMuon算法来缓解LMO有偏性问题，并分析了近似求解LMO（使用Newton-Schulz迭代）对收敛速度的影响。

Result: 实验表明FedMuon能够超越最先进的联邦学习方法，且发现FedMuon可以在任意数量的Newton-Schulz迭代下收敛，而更准确地求解LMO可以加快收敛速度。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功将Muon优化方法应用于联邦学习，解决了收敛性问题，并在性能上优于现有方法，为联邦学习提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个记忆驱动的自改进框架，将LLM的通用先验知识与特定领域的紧凑记忆相结合，通过记忆与LLM先验的相互增强来提升序列决策任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在序列决策任务中表现出色，但其广泛而通用的知识对于特定决策任务往往不足，特别是在任务相关数据有限的情况下，难以有效适应特定SDM任务。

Method: 结合LLM通用先验知识和领域特定经验的紧凑记忆，记忆保留过去的交互和相关的Q值，捕捉决策相关知识以促进准确的价值估计并指导LLM先验的优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于传统RL和基于LLM的基线方法，在ALFWorld中，内分布任务性能提升超过40%，在未见任务上的泛化能力提升超过75%。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架通过记忆与LLM先验的相互增强，有效提升了LLM在序列决策任务中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

Motivation: 解决急诊和群体伤亡事件分诊研究中缺乏开放、可复现基准的问题，降低技术门槛，使分诊预测研究更易于访问和复现。

Method: 使用LLM辅助构建数据集，包括统一噪声字段、优先选择临床相关生命体征和实验室数据、指导模式对齐和表格合并；定义两种场景并建立基线模型和SHAP可解释性分析。

Result: 成功构建了急诊分诊基准，展示了不同场景下的预测差距，并识别了对分诊最关键的特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可访问性，是临床AI中数据集民主化的重要一步。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现建立了一个多功能的生成基础，从早期命中发现到多目标先导化合物优化，并通过开源代码和预训练模型促进可重复性研究。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 梯度上升的无约束优化方法在机器遗忘中经常失败，原因是遗忘集和保留集之间存在统计依赖性，即使只是简单的相关性也会导致这些方法失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战普遍观点，揭示基于梯度上升的机器遗忘方法失败的根本原因——遗忘数据和保留数据之间的统计依赖性。

Method: 通过经验证据和理论分析，研究梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中的表现，特别关注随机遗忘集和逻辑回归案例中的失败模式。

Result: 发现梯度上升方法不仅无法达到理想的再训练模型，反而可能收敛到比原始模型更差的解，使遗忘过程产生负面效果。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使是简单相关性）足以导致基于梯度上升的机器遗忘方法失败，这一发现对实际应用有重要影响。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

### [315] [AdaBlock-dLLM: Semantic-Aware Diffusion LLM Inference via Adaptive Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26432)
*Guanxi Lu,Hao,Chen,Yuto Karashima,Zhican Wang,Daichi Fujiki,Hongxiang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了半自回归解码中固定块大小的假设，提出了AdaBlock-dLLM方法，通过自适应调整块大小来提升扩散大语言模型的解码效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码使用固定块大小存在两个根本限制：1）高置信度令牌在块外延迟解码；2）低置信度令牌在块内过早提交导致错误。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别出波动带区域，并基于此开发了AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小以对齐语义边界。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出的语义感知自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析，不仅优化了推理时间，也为未来dLLM的训练策略提供了启发。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过将每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，结合TextGrad的LLM反馈进行优化，在保持透明性和可解释性的同时达到或超过基于提示的方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险AI应用中，需要透明、可解释和可审计的决策系统。传统决策树（如CART）虽然提供清晰规则但仅限于结构化数据，而LLM在处理非结构化文本时缺乏可信赖的行为保证。

Method: ACT将决策树的分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化这些问题，从而构建可解释的分类树。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT达到或超过了基于提示的基线方法，同时产生了透明和可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的透明性和可解释性优势扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险AI应用提供了可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

### [317] [Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26442)
*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽零阶项的可和性要求为平方可和性，为强化学习中的Q-learning等算法提供收敛性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 引入对随机过程增量的新假设，结合平方可和条件，证明几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，并首次为带线性函数逼近的Q-learning提供了这些收敛结果。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为更广泛的随机迭代算法提供了收敛性分析工具，特别是在强化学习领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

*Oleksandr Shchur,Abdul Fatir Ansari,Caner Turkmen,Lorenzo Stella,Nick Erickson,Pablo Guerron,Michael Bohlke-Schneider,Yuyang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了fev-bench基准测试，包含100个时间序列预测任务，覆盖7个领域，其中46个任务包含协变量。配套的fev库支持可复现的模型评估，使用自助法置信区间进行严谨的聚合分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准存在领域覆盖窄、忽视协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、集成困难等问题，阻碍了预训练模型的合理评估和持续进步。

Method: 构建包含100个预测任务的fev-bench数据集，开发轻量级fev Python库支持可复现评估，采用自助法置信区间和双维度（胜率和技能得分）性能报告。

Result: 在fev-bench上评估了多种预训练、统计和基线模型，识别了有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench解决了现有基准的关键缺陷，为时间序列预测提供了更全面、严谨和实用的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ两种向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播硬分配的同时允许梯度流动，实现端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统向量量化中的硬分配会阻断梯度，阻碍端到端训练。需要一种既能保持前向传播硬分配特性，又能让梯度流动的量化方法。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ通过将分配扩展到码字连线构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。两种方法都不需要辅助损失或温度调度。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务中，相比其他量化方法，在多个数据集上提高了重建质量和样本质量。

Conclusion: DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ是有效的向量量化方法，能够实现端到端训练，在压缩和生成任务中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个将张量场网络转换为更高效的局部正则化范式的框架，保持等变性同时显著提升运行效率，并发布了相应的PyTorch实现包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在分子和几何数据学习中具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖专门且计算昂贵的张量操作，需要提高计算效率。

Method: 开发了一个框架，将现有张量场网络转换为局部正则化范式，系统比较不同等变表示的理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测准确性。

Result: 该框架在保持等变性的同时显著改善了运行时间，并提供了易于集成到标准消息传递神经网络中的实现。

Conclusion: 局部正则化范式为等变神经网络提供了高效的计算方案，使等变性能够更便捷地集成到标准神经网络架构中。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

*Xi Wang,James McInerney,Lequn Wang,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出EAT（Entropy After </Think>）信号来检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过监控推理过程中的熵变化来提前终止推理，节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长链思维中表现更好，但存在过度思考的问题——即使已经得出正确答案仍继续推理，浪费计算资源。需要一种方法来检测和防止这种低效行为。

Method: 在推理过程中添加停止思考标记（</think>），监控后续标记的熵变化轨迹。当Pass@1达到平稳时，熵会下降并稳定，通过指数移动平均的方差阈值来实现实用的停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法将token使用量减少了13-21%，且不影响准确率。即使在无法访问推理模型logits的黑盒设置中，使用代理模型计算EAT仍然有效。

Conclusion: EAT提供了一种简单且低成本的方法来检测和防止模型过度思考，能够根据EAT轨迹自适应分配计算资源，相比固定token预算的方法更高效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端-服务器不匹配的模型架构和知识蒸馏来解决异构联邦学习中的个性化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习产生的最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求，特别是在数据、任务和模态都存在异构性的环境中，缺乏对基础模型进行微调和个人化的研究

Method: TAP采用两阶段方法：(i) 利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配来选择性进行替换操作；(ii) 在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，在不损害个性化的前提下捕捉有益的一般知识

Result: 通过大量实验证明，TAP在各种数据集和任务上相比多个基线方法都表现出有效性

Conclusion: TAP能够有效解决异构联邦学习环境下的个性化问题，特别是在多任务多模态场景中，随着模态-任务对数量的增加，服务器模型服务所有任务的能力会受到影响

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂且依赖性增强，电力系统成为网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是针对不稳定性攻击的防护措施相对较少。

Method: 使用改进的Prony分析(MPA)作为检测不稳定性攻击的方法，在IEEE 14总线系统上通过Achilles Heel Technologies电力网格分析器进行概念验证。

Result: 证明MPA是检测不稳定性攻击并触发防御机制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种成本效益高的不稳定性攻击防御解决方案。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种可解释性方法，能够根据训练好的神经网络来度量数据点之间的相似性，帮助理解模型如何组织和分类数据。

Method: 构建损失核作为低损失保持参数扰动分布下计算的每样本损失的协方差矩阵，通过参数扰动来探索模型的相似性度量。

Result: 在合成多任务问题上验证了方法有效性，显示能按任务分离输入；在Inception-v1上应用显示核结构与WordNet语义层次对齐。

Conclusion: 损失核是实用可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络内部的数据组织方式。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

*Yida Wang,Ke Hong,Xiuhong Li,Yuanchao Xu,Wenxun Wang,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TASP方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，解决Ring Attention在长上下文LLMs中通信效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文大语言模型的自注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题。主流序列并行方法Ring Attention采用Ring AllGather通信原语，但其通信效率低，与现代加速器的AlltoAll拓扑不匹配。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解思想，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，同时将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出拓扑感知的序列并行方法TASP。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高可达3.58倍加速。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑分解和原语分解有效提升了长上下文LLMs序列并行的通信效率，在现代加速器拓扑上表现优异。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/infinigence/HamiltonAttention.

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to

minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤由多种机械和机械生物学破坏引起，不同损伤会造成不同的机械脆弱性，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成数百种异质性损伤的合成胸主动脉瘤，构建局部扩张和扩张性的空间图，训练多种神经网络架构（DeepONet、UNet、Laplace神经算子）预测初始损伤组合。

Conclusion: 在胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张度和扩张性的全场测量对于揭示疾病的机械生物学驱动因素至关重要，支持个性化治疗策略的开发。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet

### [329] [Linking Process to Outcome: Conditional Reward Modeling for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26578)
*Zheng Zhang,Ziwei Shan,Kaitao Song,Yexin Li,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时序过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与前序步骤和最终结果关联，解决现有过程奖励模型的依赖捕获和信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型(PRMs)要么孤立处理推理步骤，无法捕捉步骤间依赖关系，要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题。

Method: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)，将LLM推理视为导向正确答案的时序过程。每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联。通过强制执行条件概率规则，捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习的实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，无需依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励即可实现稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过一致的概​​率建模实现更可靠的跨样本比较，解决了信用分配模糊问题。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

### [330] [Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26594)
*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL通过强化学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，解决视觉数学推理中因信息缺失导致的接口不匹配问题，无需显式标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型为人类读者生成的图像描述往往省略推理系统所需的关键细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是缺乏必要的视觉信息。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过交互训练视觉模型理解推理器需要的信息，利用澄清请求揭示信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使生成全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求，可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互就能有效学习视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督信号。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于适当评分规则的统一回归不确定性量化框架，能够自然分解为偶然不确定性和认知不确定性，并在实际参数假设下推导出闭式表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型预测的不确定性量化对安全关键应用至关重要，但现有进展主要集中在分类任务，回归任务的不确定性量化仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于适当评分规则（如CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分）构建统一框架，在实际参数假设下推导闭式表达式，并使用模型集成进行估计。

Result: 框架能够自然分解不确定性为偶然和认知分量，并恢复基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量，在合成和真实数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠UQ度量提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该工作为回归任务提供了一个统一且理论严谨的不确定性量化框架，能够有效分解不同类型的不确定性，为安全关键应用提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

TL;DR: 提出递归自聚合（RSA）方法，结合并行和顺序推理的优势，通过迭代聚合候选推理链来提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展方法要么采用并行推理（选择多个独立解），要么采用顺序推理（自我精炼），但都未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。RSA旨在结合两者的优势，通过聚合推理链中的中间步骤来提升模型性能。

Method: RSA是一种受进化方法启发的测试时扩展方法，通过递归地聚合候选推理链的子集来改进解决方案。每个步骤都会从当前候选池中生成改进的解决方案，作为下一轮迭代的输入。该方法还引入了聚合感知的强化学习训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都能带来显著的性能提升。Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507模型使用RSA后，在AIME-25、HMMT-25等多个基准测试中表现优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略，甚至能与更大的推理模型竞争。

Conclusion: RSA通过有效利用推理链中的丰富信息，结合并行和顺序推理的优势，为提升大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效途径，特别是在有限计算预算下实现更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，方法在性能、采样和训练效率方面持续优于先前方法

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过注意力引导的探索和高效采样策略，显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: AccidentBench是一个大规模多模态基准测试，结合车辆事故场景和空中、水域等安全关键场景，包含2000个视频和19000个标注问答对，用于评估模型在真实世界安全关键环境中的时空推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型的快速发展需要能够严格评估在安全关键、动态真实世界环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。现有基准测试在覆盖安全关键场景和系统评估核心能力方面存在不足。

Method: 构建包含约2000个视频和19000个人工标注问答对的大规模基准测试，涵盖不同视频长度（短/中/长）和难度级别（简单/中等/困难）。任务系统性地探测核心能力：时间、空间和意图理解与推理。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最困难任务和最长视频上，最强模型也仅达到约18%的准确率，揭示了在真实世界时空和意图推理方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在暴露这些关键差距，并推动开发更安全、更鲁棒、更符合真实世界安全关键挑战的多模态模型。该基准测试为模型在真实世界变异性下的评估提供了全面的物理基础测试平台。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI对数据扰动和对抗样本的敏感性，需要在部署前进行鲁棒性评估，但传统方法需要访问训练和测试数据集，这会带来数据隐私和机密性风险。

Conclusion: SPATA方法有助于提高处理机密数据或关键基础设施的组织的透明度，促进更可信的AI发展。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.
