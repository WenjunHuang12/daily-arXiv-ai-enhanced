Prior\nmethods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw\nmodality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the\nuser-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these\nsemantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient\nmodeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions\nintroduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising\nperformance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals\nfrom the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item\nsemantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based\npersonalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with\nmodulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive\nviews. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through\ncontrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in\nsemantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism\nthat first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based\nInfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns\nbehavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to\nensure representation consistency.

A fundamental challenge is robustly grounding\nnatural language instructions.

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards\n(RLVR) has proven to be effective at improving spatial alignment for these\nMLLMs, we find that inefficient exploration bottlenecks semantic alignment,\nwhich prevent models from learning difficult semantic associations. To address\nthis exploration problem, we present Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization\n(AEPO), a new policy optimization framework.

Recent work by Kadekodi et al.\ndemonstrates that adapting code parameters to varying disk failure rates can\nlead to significant storage savings without compromising reliability. Such\nadaptations, known as \\emph{code conversions}, motivate the design of\n\\emph{convertible codes}, which enable efficient transformations between codes\nof different parameters.\n  In this work, we study the setting in which $\\lambda$ codewords of an initial\n$[n^I = k^I + r^I,\\, k^I]$ MDS code are merged into a single codeword of a\nfinal $[n^F = \\lambda k^I + r^F,\\, k^F = \\lambda k^I]$ MDS code. We begin by\npresenting three constructions that achieve optimal \\emph{access cost}, defined\nas the total number of disks accessed during the conversion process. The first\ntwo constructions apply when $\\lambda \\leq r^I$ and impose specific\ndivisibility conditions on $r^I$ and the field size $q$. These schemes minimize\nboth the per-symbol and the overall access cost. The third construction, which\nbuilds on a prior scheme by Kong, achieves minimal access cost while supporting\narbitrary parameter regimes.

Balancing\nsupply and demand in such networks is both a temporal and spatial challenge due\nto capacity constraints. The recent surge in the number of household-owned\nbatteries, especially in regions with rooftop solar adoption, offers mitigation\npotential but often acts misaligned with grid-level objectives. In fact, the\ndecision to charge or discharge a household-owned battery is a strategic choice\nby each battery owner governed by selfish incentives. This calls for an\nanalysis from a game-theoretic point of view.\n  We initiate this timely research direction by considering a game-theoretic\nsetting where selfish agents strategically charge or discharge their batteries\nto increase their profit. In particular, we study a Stackelberg-like market\nmodel where a third party introduces price incentives, aiming to optimize\nrenewable energy utilization while preserving grid feasibility. For this, we\nstudy the existence and the quality of equilibria under various pricing\nstrategies. We find that the existence of equilibria crucially depends on the\nchosen pricing and that the obtained social welfare varies widely.

However, octrees\nenforce isotropic refinement in regions of interest, which can be especially\ninefficient for problems that are intrinsically anisotropic--much resolution is\nspent where little information is gained. This paper presents omnitrees as an\nanisotropic generalization of octrees and related data structures. Omnitrees\nallow to refine only the locally most important dimensions, providing tree\nstructures that are less deep than bintrees and less wide than octrees. As a\nresult, the convergence of the AMR schemes can be increased by up to a factor\nof the dimensionality d for very anisotropic problems, quickly offsetting their\nmodest increase in storage overhead. We validate this finding on the problem of\nbinary shape representation across 4,166 three-dimensional objects: Omnitrees\nincrease the mean convergence rate by 1.5x, require less storage to achieve\nequivalent error bounds, and maximize the information density of the stored\nfunction faster than octrees. These advantages are projected to be even\nstronger for higher-dimensional problems. We provide a first validation by\nintroducing a time-dependent rotation to create four-dimensional\nrepresentations, and discuss the properties of their 4-d octree and omnitree\napproximations.

In many practical scenarios, data points come with associated\nweights that reflect their importance, frequency, or confidence. Given a\nweighted point set $P \\subset R^d$, where each point $p \\in P$ has a positive\nweight $w_p$, the goal is to compute a set of $k$ centers $C = \\{ c_1, c_2,\n\\ldots, c_k \\} \\subset R^d$ that minimizes the weighted clustering cost:\n$\\Delta_w(P,C) = \\sum_{p \\in P} w_p \\cdot d(p,C)^2$, where $d(p,C)$ denotes the\nEuclidean distance from $p$ to its nearest center in $C$. Although most\nexisting coreset-based algorithms for $k$-means extend naturally to the\nweighted setting and provide a PTAS, no prior work has offered a simple,\ncoreset-free PTAS designed specifically for the weighted $k$-means problem.\n  In this paper, we present a simple PTAS for weighted $k$-means that does not\nrely on coresets. Building upon the framework of Jaiswal, Kumar, and Sen (2012)\nfor the unweighted case, we extend the result to the weighted setting by using\nthe weighted $D^2$-sampling technique. Our algorithm runs in time $n d \\cdot\n2^{O\\left(\\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}\\right)}$ and outputs a set of $k$ centers whose\ntotal clustering cost is within a $(1 + \\epsilon)$-factor of the optimal cost.\nAs a key application of the weighted $k$-means, we obtain a PTAS for the sensor\ncoverage problem, which can also be viewed as a continuous locational\noptimization problem.

While traditional approaches predominantly model\nquery rewrites as isolated pairs, they often fail to capture the sequential and\ntransitional dynamics inherent in real-world user behavior. In this work, we\npropose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional\nqueries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward\ntheir final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from\neBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that\nreflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence. This approach\nallows us to model a user's shopping funnel, where mid-journey transitions\nreflect exploratory behavior and intent refinement. Furthermore, we incorporate\ngenerative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and\nintent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived\nthrough collaborative filtering alone.

However, real-world utility data originates from multiple sources\nwith varying characteristics and levels of quality. In this work, developed in\ncollaboration with Oncor Electric Delivery, we propose a scalable framework\nthat reconstructs a trustworthy grid topology by systematically integrating\nheterogeneous data. We observe that distribution topology is fundamentally\ngoverned by two complementary dimensions: the spatial layout of physical\ninfrastructure (e.g., GIS and asset metadata) and the dynamic behavior of the\nsystem in the signal domain (e.g., voltage time series). When jointly\nleveraged, these dimensions support a complete and physically coherent\nreconstruction of network connectivity. To address the challenge of uneven data\nquality without compromising observability, we introduce a confidence-aware\ninference mechanism that preserves structurally informative yet imperfect\ninputs, while quantifying the reliability of each inferred connection for\noperator interpretation. This soft handling of uncertainty is tightly coupled\nwith hard enforcement of physical feasibility: we embed operational\nconstraints, such as transformer capacity limits and radial topology\nrequirements, directly into the learning process. Together, these components\nensure that inference is both uncertainty-aware and structurally valid,\nenabling rapid convergence to actionable, trustworthy topologies under\nreal-world deployment conditions.

Most critically, they\nprovide no standardized framework for comparing RAG effectiveness across\ndifferent models and domains.\n  We introduce OmniBench RAG, a novel automated platform for multi domain\nevaluation of RAG systems. The platform quantifies performance gains across\naccuracy and efficiency dimensions, spanning nine knowledge fields including\nculture, geography, and health. We introduce two standardized metrics:\nImprovements (accuracy gains) and Transformation (efficiency differences\nbetween pre RAG and post RAG models), enabling reproducible comparisons across\nmodels and tasks. The platform features dynamic test generation, modular\nevaluation pipelines, and automated knowledge base construction. Our evaluation\nreveals striking variability in RAG effectiveness, from significant gains in\nculture to declines in mathematics, highlighting the critical importance of\nsystematic, domain aware assessment.

In addition to maintaining acceptable collision\nrisks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by\nmaking early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete\naction and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when\nto initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for\nconjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The\nMarkov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the\nreliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which\nincreases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked\nconjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation\nstudy on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction\nevents, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average\npropellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy\nthat initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On\nhistorical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant\noverall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM.

Decomposition is done by applying machine learning to fit\na dual signal. Machine learning minimizes the loss function which compromises\nbetween fitting the original time series and penalizing irregularities of the\ndual signal. The latter includes terms based on the first and second order\nderivatives along time. To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries. By isolating noise, the proposed decomposition can be seen as a\ndenoising algorithm. Two approaches of the learning process have been\nconsidered: sequential and jointly. The former approach learns the mean signal\nfirst and then dispersion. The latter approach fits the dual signal jointly.\nJointly learning can uncover complex relationships for the time series with\nheteroskedasticity. Learning has been set by solving the direct non-linear\nunconstrained optimization problem or by applying neural networks that have\nsequential or twin output architectures. Tuning of the loss function\nhyperparameters focuses on the isolated noise to be a stationary stochastic\nprocess without autocorrelation properties. Depending on the applications, the\nhyperparameters of the learning can be tuned towards either the discrete states\nby stepped signal or smoothed series.

While exact algorithms based on MILP, CP, SAT, or dynamic\nprogramming guarantee optimality, they often suffer from poor anytime behavior\n-- meaning they struggle to find high-quality decision trees quickly when the\nsearch is stopped before completion -- due to unbalanced search space\nexploration. To address this, several anytime extensions of exact methods have\nbeen proposed, such as LDS-DL8.5, Top-k-DL8.5, and Blossom, but they have not\nbeen systematically compared, making it difficult to assess their relative\neffectiveness. In this paper, we propose CA-DL8.5, a generic, complete, and\nanytime beam search algorithm that extends the DL8.5 framework and unifies some\nexisting anytime strategies. In particular, CA-DL8.5 generalizes previous\napproaches LDS-DL8.5 and Top-k-DL8.5, by allowing the integration of various\nheuristics and relaxation mechanisms through a modular design. The algorithm\nreuses DL8.5's efficient branch-and-bound pruning and trie-based caching,\ncombined with a restart-based beam search that gradually relaxes pruning\ncriteria to improve solution quality over time. Our contributions are twofold:\n(1) We introduce this new generic framework for exact and anytime decision tree\nlearning, enabling the incorporation of diverse heuristics and search\nstrategies; (2) We conduct a rigorous empirical comparison of several\ninstantiations of CA-DL8.5 -- based on Purity, Gain, Discrepancy, and Top-k\nheuristics -- using an anytime evaluation metric called the primal gap\nintegral.

We introduce SKATE: a novel evaluation\nframework in which large language models (LLMs) compete by generating and\nsolving verifiable tasks for one another. Our core insight is to treat\nevaluation as a game: models act as both task-setters and solvers, incentivized\nto create questions which highlight their own strengths while exposing others'\nweaknesses. SKATE offers several key advantages, balancing scalability,\nopen-endedness, and objectivity. It is fully automated, data-free, and\nscalable, requiring no human input or domain expertise. By using verifiable\ntasks rather than LLM judges, scoring is objective. Unlike domain-limited\nprogrammatically-generated benchmarks (e.g. chess-playing or spatial\nreasoning), having LLMs creatively pose challenges enables open-ended and\nscalable evaluation.

In\nthis paper, we propose ASAP (Anchor-guided, Surprisal-based Pruning), a novel\ncoarse-to-fine framework for CoT compression. ASAP first performs anchor-guided\npruning to preserve the core reasoning structure, which efficiently reduces the\nsearch space for subsequent processing. It then enables a logic-aware pruning\nby selecting logically essential reasoning steps based on a novel first-token\nsurprisal metric.

In this work, we first identify two main challenges in\nmodeling heterophily HGs: (1) varying heterophily distributions across hops and\nmeta-paths; (2) the intricate and often heterophily-driven diversity of\nsemantic information across different meta-paths. Then, we propose the Adaptive\nHeterogeneous Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) to tackle these challenges. AHGNN\nemploys a heterophily-aware convolution that accounts for heterophily\ndistributions specific to both hops and meta-paths. It then integrates messages\nfrom diverse semantic spaces using a coarse-to-fine attention mechanism, which\nfilters out noise and emphasizes informative signals.

As a more\nfeasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback\nhas shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video\nusually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often\nnoisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons,\nrather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests,\nthereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which\nleverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and\nin-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users.\nSpecifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager\n(UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a\n``summarize-cluster-reflect\" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback\nModeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning\napproach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the\nreinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the\nreasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have\nconstructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit\nfeedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k\nvideos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback.

As a\nresult, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as\ninteractions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack\nsufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using\nmultimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.\nHowever, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not\ntailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user\ntastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual\ntones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming\nscenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk\nof forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts\n(XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation.\nXSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert\nnetworks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in\nresponse to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert\nand backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains\nmodel compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without\noverwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold\nstart and shifting preferences in multimodal features.

A number of following\npublications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved\nby, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers,\nusing better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions.\nHowever, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been\nsystematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper.\nThrough our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's\ntraining objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call\nthis combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on\nrealistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that\ncommon academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to\nthe most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main\nproduction-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of\nthe accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and\nFuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively\nstraightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU),\nwe believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation\npipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging\ncomplicated algorithms.

Traditional multilingual\nmodels, which require simultaneous access to all language data, are impractical\ndue to the sequential arrival of data and privacy constraints. Continual\nLearning (CL) offers a solution by enabling models to learn new languages\nsequentially without catastrophically forgetting previously learned knowledge.\nThis paper investigates CL for ASR on Indian languages using a subset of the\nIndicSUPERB benchmark. We employ a Conformer-based hybrid RNN-T/CTC model,\ninitially pretrained on Hindi, which is then incrementally trained on eight\nadditional Indian languages, for a total sequence of nine languages. We\nevaluate three prominent regularization- and distillation-based CL strategies:\nElastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), and Learning\nwithout Forgetting (LwF), selected for their suitability in no-replay,\nprivacy-conscious scenarios. Performance is analyzed using Word Error Rate\n(WER) for both RNN-T and CTC paths on clean and noisy data, as well as\nknowledge retention via Backward Transfer. We also explore the impact of\nvarying the number of training epochs (1, 2, 5, and 10) per task.

Through extensive evaluations on Overcooked-AI and the\nOvercooked Generalisation Challenge, we demonstrate that this dynamic partner\ncurriculum is highly effective: UPD consistently outperforms both\npopulation-based and population-free baselines as well as ablations. In a user\nstudy, we further show that UPD achieves higher returns than all baselines and\nwas perceived as significantly more adaptive, more human-like, a better\ncollaborator, and less frustrating.", "AI": {"tldr": "UPD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f19\u4f34\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f19\u4f34\u6216\u624b\u52a8\u8c03\u53c2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u4f18\u5316\u4f19\u4f34\u3002", "result": "\u5728Overcooked-AI\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cUPD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "UPD\u4e3a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u534f\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
