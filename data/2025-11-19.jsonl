We ask an LLM to summarize and draft legal letters, based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues in various domains.

Despite the rapid advancement of LLMs gradually replacing traditional BERT architectures for embedding, their training paradigms still adhere to BERT-like supervised fine-tuning and hard negative mining strategies. This approach relies on complex offline hard negative sample construction pipelines, which constrain model iteration efficiency and hinder the evolutionary potential of semantic representation capabilities. Besides, existing multi-task learning frameworks face the seesaw effect when simultaneously optimizing semantic relevance and non-relevance objectives. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-GRPO, a multi-objective reinforcement learning-based dense retrieval framework designed to address these challenges. The method eliminates offline hard negative sample construction by dynamically retrieving Top-K candidate products for each query during training, while introducing a relevance LLM as a reward model to generate real-time feedback. Specifically, the retrieval model dynamically optimizes embedding representations through reinforcement learning, with reward signals combining LLM-generated relevance scores, product quality scores, and multi-way exclusivity metrics to achieve multi-objective user preference alignment and real-time error correction. This mechanism not only removes dependency on hard negatives but also mitigates the seesaw effect through collaborative multi-objective optimization, significantly enhancing the model's semantic generalization capability for complex long-tail queries. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of Retrieval-GRPO, which has been deployed on China's largest e-commerce platform."}

To address this problem, our work proposes Weighted-AST retrieval with prompting, an architecture that integrates structural query representations and LLM prompting. This method retrieves semantically relevant examples as few-shot prompts using a similarity metric based on an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with learned feature weights. Our structure-aware prompting technique ensures that generated descriptions are both fluent and faithful to the original query logic. Numerous experiments on three benchmark datasets - Spider, SParC, and CoSQL show that our method outperforms the current baselines by up to +17.24% in execution Accuracy (EX), performs superior in Exact Match (EM) and provides more consistent semantic fidelity when evaluated by humans, all while preserving competitive runtime performance. These results demonstrate that Weighted-AST prompting is a scalable and effective method for deriving natural language explanations from structured database queries."}

We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.\n  TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.\n  Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure."}

In DSA, $K$ users are interconnected through error-free broadcast channels. Each user holds a private input and aims to compute the sum of all other users' inputs, while satisfying the security constraint that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users, can infer any information about the inputs beyond the recovered sum. To ensure security, users are equipped with secret keys to mask their inputs. Motivated by recent advances in efficient group-based key generation protocols, we consider the symmetric groupwise key setting, where every subset of $G$ users shares a group key that is independent of all other group keys. The problem is challenging because the recovery and security constraints must hold simultaneously for all users, and the structural constraints on the secret keys limit the flexibility of key correlations. We characterize the optimal rate region consisting of all achievable pairs of per-user broadcast communication rate and groupwise key rate. In particular, we show that DSA with groupwise keys is infeasible when $G=1$ or $G\\ge K-T$. Otherwise, when $2\\le G<K-T$, to securely compute one symbol of the desired sum, each user must broadcast at least one symbol, and each group key must contain at least $(K-T-2)/\\binom{K-T-1}{G}$ independent symbols. Our results establish the fundamental limits of DSA with groupwise keys and provide design insights for communication- and key-efficient secure aggregation in decentralized learning systems."}

However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity.

Verifying whether a database upholds its claimed guarantees is increasingly critical, as these guarantees form a contract between the vendor and its users. However, this task is challenging, particularly in black-box settings, where only observable system behavior is available and often involves uncertain dependencies between transactions.\n  In this paper, we present VeriStrong, a fast verifier for strong database isolation. At its core is a novel formalism called hyper-polygraphs, which compactly captures both certain and uncertain transactional dependencies in database executions. Leveraging this formalism, we develop sound and complete encodings for verifying both serializability and snapshot isolation. To achieve high efficiency, VeriStrong tailors SMT solving to the characteristics of database workloads, in contrast to prior general-purpose approaches. Our extensive evaluation across diverse benchmarks shows that VeriStrong not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art verifiers on the workloads they support, but also scales to large, general workloads beyond their reach, while maintaining high accuracy in detecting isolation anomalies."}

To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders.

In the era of large language models (LLMs), LLM-based recommender systems have emerged as a prevalent paradigm for advancing personalized recommendations. Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has drawn growing interest to facilitate the recommendation capability of LLMs, incorporating useful information retrieved from external knowledge bases. However, as a rich source of up-to-date information, the web remains under-explored by existing RAG-based recommendations. In particular, unique challenges are posed from two perspectives: one is to generate effective queries for web retrieval, considering the inherent knowledge gap between web search and recommendations; another challenge lies in harnessing online websites that contain substantial noisy content. To tackle these limitations, we propose WebRec, a novel web-based RAG framework, which takes advantage of the reasoning capability of LLMs to interpret recommendation tasks into queries of user preferences that cater to web retrieval. Moreover, given noisy web-retrieved information, where relevant pieces of evidence are scattered far apart, an insightful MP-Head is designed to enhance LLM attentions between distant tokens of relevant information via message passing. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed web-based RAG methods in recommendation scenarios."}

Persisting these objects is critical, not only to enhance system robustness against unexpected failures but also to support continuous, non-linear data exploration via versioning. Existing object persistence mechanisms (e.g., Pickle, Dill) rely on complete snapshotting, often redundantly storing unchanged objects during execution and exploration, resulting in significant inefficiency in both time and storage. Unlike DBMSs, data science systems lack centralized buffer managers that track dirty objects. Worse, object states span various locations such as memory heaps, shared memory, GPUs, and remote machines, making dirty object identification fundamentally more challenging. In this work, we propose a graph-based object store, named Chipmink, that acts like the centralized buffer manager. Unlike static pages in DBMSs, persistence units in Chipmink are dynamically induced by partitioning objects into appropriate subgroups (called pods), minimizing expected persistence costs based on object sizes and reference structure. These pods effectively isolate dirty objects, enabling efficient partial persistence. Our experiments show that Chipmink is general, supporting libraries that rely on shared memory, GPUs, and remote objects. Moreover, Chipmink achieves up to 36.5x smaller storage sizes and 12.4x faster persistence than the best baselines in real-world notebooks and scripts."}

To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness."}

As the performance of query execution critically depends on this choice, join ordering lies at the core of query optimization. Traditional approaches cast this problem as a discrete combinatorial search over binary trees guided by a cost model, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. We show that, when the cost model is differentiable, the query plans can be continuously relaxed into a soft adjacency matrix representing a superposition of plans. This continuous relaxation, together with a Gumbel-Softmax parameterization of the adjacency matrix and differentiable constraints enforcing plan validity, enables gradient-based search for plans within this relaxed space. Using a learned Graph Neural Network as the cost model, we demonstrate that this gradient-based approach can find comparable and even lower-cost plans compared to traditional discrete local search methods on two different graph datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show that the runtime of this approach scales linearly with query size, in contrast to quadratic or exponential runtimes of classical approaches. We believe this first step towards gradient-based join ordering can lead to more effective and efficient query optimizers in the future."}

This fundamental asymmetry between the training and inference phases prevents the generative paradigm from realizing its full potential. To address this limitation, we propose the Symmetric Masked Generative Paradigm for CTR prediction (SGCTR), a novel framework that establishes symmetry between the training and inference phases.

These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects."}

Despite significant advancements in translation accuracy, critical usability challenges, such as user frustration, query refinement strategies, and error recovery, remain underexplored. To investigate these usability dimensions, we conducted a mixed-method user study comparing SQL-LLM, a state-of-the-art NL2SQL system, with Snowflake, a traditional SQL analytics platform. Our controlled evaluation involved 20 participants completing realistic database querying tasks across 12 queries each. Results show that SQL-LLM significantly reduced query completion times by 10 to 30 percent (mean: 418 s vs. 629 s, p = 0.036) and improved overall accuracy from 50 to 75 percent (p = 0.002). Additionally, participants using SQL-LLM exhibited fewer query reformulations, recovered from errors 30 to 40 seconds faster, and reported lower frustration levels compared to Snowflake users. Behavioral analysis revealed that SQL-LLM encouraged structured, schema-first querying strategies, enhancing user confidence and efficiency, particularly for complex queries. These findings underscore the practical significance of well-designed, user-friendly NLIDBs in business analytics settings, emphasizing the critical role of usability alongside technical accuracy in real-world deployments."}

This paper presents NeuCLIRBench, an evaluation collection for cross-language and multilingual retrieval. The collection consists of documents written natively in Chinese, Persian, and Russian, as well as those same documents machine translated into English. The collection supports several retrieval scenarios including: monolingual retrieval in English, Chinese, Persian, or Russian; cross-language retrieval with English as the query language and one of the other three languages as the document language; and multilingual retrieval, again with English as the query language and relevant documents in all three languages. NeuCLIRBench combines the TREC NeuCLIR track topics of 2022, 2023, and 2024. The 250,128 judgments across approximately 150 queries for the monolingual and cross-language tasks and 100 queries for multilingual retrieval provide strong statistical discriminatory power to distinguish retrieval approaches. A fusion baseline of strong neural retrieval systems is included with the collection so that developers of reranking algorithms are no longer reliant on BM25 as their first-stage retriever. NeuCLIRBench is publicly available."}

Recent growths in both data and task complexity have motivated placing vector indexes onto remote storage -- cloud-native vector search, which cloud providers have recently introduced services for. Yet, despite varying workload characteristics and various available vector index forms, providers default to using cluster-based indexes, which on paper do adapt well to differences between disk and cloud-based environment: their fetch granularities and lack of notable intra-query dependencies aligns with the large optimal fetch sizes and minimizes costly round-trips (i.e., as opposed to graph-based indexes) to remote storage, respectively.\n  This paper systematically studies cloud-native vector search: What and how should indexes be built and used for on-cloud vector search? We analyze bottlenecks of two common index classes, cluster and graph indexes, on remote storage, and show that despite current standardized adoption of cluster indexes on the cloud, graph indexes are favored in workloads requiring high concurrency and recall, or operating on high-dimensional data or large datatypes. We further find that on-cloud search demands significantly different indexing and search parameterizations versus on-disk search for optimal performance. Finally, we incorporate existing cloud-based caching setups into vector search and find that certain index optimizations work against caching, and study how this can be mitigated to maximize gains under various available cache sizes."}
