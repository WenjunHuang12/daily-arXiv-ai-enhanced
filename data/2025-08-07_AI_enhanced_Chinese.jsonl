This paper is the first to introduce a sublinear-time\nalgorithm for counting squares in the packed setting. The packed representation\nof a string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ is given as a\nsequence of $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ machine words in the word-RAM model (a machine\nword consists of $\\omega \\ge \\log_2 n$ bits).

The\nlong-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer\nruns) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\\Omega(n)$. The number of all\nother long-period runs is $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ and we can construct an implicit\nrepresentation of all long-period runs in $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ time by\nleveraging the insights of Amir et al. [ESA 2019]. We count squares in layer\nruns by exploiting combinatorial properties of pyramidally-shaped groups of\nlayer runs. Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots\nof runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate\nequal squares.

This paper\nmodels data embedding in 3D printing using principles from error-correcting\ncodes, aiming to recover embedded information from partial or altered fragments\nof the object. Previous works embedded one-dimensional data (i.e., a vector)\ninside the object, and required almost all fragments of the object for\nsuccessful decoding. In this work, we study a problem setting in which only one\nsufficiently large fragment of the object is available for decoding. We first\nshow that for one-dimensional embedded information the problem can be easily\nsolved using existing tools.

Unfortunately, this\nparadigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,\nand (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,\nsystem-wide safety collapses.

Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of\nreasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to\nenhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability.

To address these issues, we propose\nCX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\"\nreasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and\nverifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an\ninstruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148\nsamples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points\nsupervised by clinical reports.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain\nMLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,\nachieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable\nCXR-specific models.

To resolve\nthese challenges, we introduce BridgeScope, a universal toolkit bridging LLMs\nand databases through three key innovations.

This protocol is\nstraightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a\nparticular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that\nonline systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models\nreflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But\nif this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will\na model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose\na methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are\nretrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on\nthe one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand,\n(quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation\nprotocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is\nagnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of\nthis framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of\nalgorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and\nplasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible\ntrade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will\nbe necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the\nusefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics\nof recommendation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4ec5\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGoodReads\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

This paper primarily focuses on achieving an\nequilibrium between the number of transmitted molecules and the bit error rate\n(BER) performance.

Given the difference in magnitude between the number of\ntransmitted molecules and the BER, these parameters are normalized to\nfacilitate analysis. Subsequently, a Gradient Descent Algorithm is employed to\ndetermine the optimal number of transmitted molecules, aiming to achieve the\noptimal equilibrium in the analyzed MC system.

Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts\nrecommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies\nheavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of\nusers with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for\nthe majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the\nproblem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two\nkey challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse\nsearch interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under\nsparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich\nsearch interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions.\nBased on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing\non the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced\nRecommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with\nvector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and\nthereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings\nof users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of\nusers with sparse interactions.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nU-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully\ndeep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational\nEM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational\nefficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers\nand the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the\ndecomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a\nmultiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a\nphysics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-\nand mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)\nobjects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering\nmodeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.\nExperimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface\ncurrent distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while\nsignificantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep\nlearning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our\nevaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of\nthe U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7f51\u7edc\uff08U-PINet\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u6563\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "U-PINet\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u8fd1\u573a\u548c\u8fdc\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "U-PINet\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u9762\u7535\u6d41\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u96f7\u8fbe\u622a\u9762\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "U-PINet\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To address these issues,\nwe propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core\ngeographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into\nan iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed\ninto three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects\nrelevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that\nchooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in\nprevious rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative\nrefinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further\nrounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction\nquality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable\nrelationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property\nestimation to socioeconomic prediction.

Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains\nchallenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a\ncomplex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal\nconcatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to\naccount for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our\nmethod is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the\nnumber of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially\nstructured.

Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent\ninteractions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions.\nMany recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older\ninteractions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the\nmore informative, recent information.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space.

The\nproposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation\nEquation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and\nmultiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the\nmass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first\nstep, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete\nmicroscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based\non manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space\ninto the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the\ncorresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning\nreduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning\ntechniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the\ncrowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density\nprofiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density\ndistribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent\nspace->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective\nsolution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.\nFor our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a\ncorridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities.

In these domains,\nfairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a\ncommon challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade\nAUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional\nOptimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework\nthat strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups\nusing optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable\nproportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged\ngroup. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between\nreducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,\nwe extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions\nto concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,\npublic, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms\nexisting post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,\noften achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive\ngains in utility.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we\nincorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances\nlocal advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic\ntransitions between exploration and convergence throughout training.

We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm\nfor private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with\ndistributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client\ninto multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,\nnon-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client\nsecurely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,\nensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise\ninput privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:\nPrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy\nattacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,\nwhich leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and\nprevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and\nCelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split\ninference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy\nloss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based\nin-distribution and adaptive attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "PrivDFS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u670d\u52a1\uff08MLaaS\uff09\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u52a0\u5bc6\u6216\u62c6\u5206\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e73\u8861\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u5206\u53d1\u5230\u975e\u5171\u8c0b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08PrivDFS-AT\uff09\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u5bc6\u94a5\uff08PrivDFS-KD\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCelebA\u4e0a\uff0cPrivDFS\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8ba1\u7b97100\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PrivDFS\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we\nexamine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model\narchitecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation\nmethodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are\nconcentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based\ntechniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these\nmethods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between\nmodalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity\nacross domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in\nmultimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,\nrobustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual\nfactors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of\nrecommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized\nevaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to\nsupport future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible\nmulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u5206\u6790\u4e862020\u5e74\u81f32024\u5e74\u521d\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08XAI\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u900f\u660e\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001XAI\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

However,\nexisting SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which\nforces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,\nresulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the\ndraft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is\nrejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be\ndiscarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we\npropose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a\n'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and\nverification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared\ncache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's\ngeneration direction.

Existing PFL\nmethods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data\nheterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders\nconvergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in\nthe long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently\nsensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the\nresearch gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized\nFederated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)\nsolutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend\nof self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen\nbackbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,\nwe further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To\nsupport both collective generalization and individual personalization, our\nFedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic\nglobal aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form\nsolutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity\ninvariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless\nof how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients.

However,\ntraffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy\nconstraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for\ntraffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on\ndesigning communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information\nfrom other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop\nFed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to\nprocess its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information\nloss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI\nsignificantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,\nand achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy\nregulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and\nfederated settings.

Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential\nfor efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were\ninvestigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from\nexperimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in\naluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data\ninto the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we\nintroduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic\ndisplacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in\nfunction to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a\ncustom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to\ncounteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we\nintroduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via\na look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure\nphysically meaningful temperatures.

In this\npaper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,\nCaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to\neffectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural\ncausal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle\nthe challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with\na novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a\nperiodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach.
