We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of\nthe probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume.

The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new\nparadigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native\nmechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged\nto tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of\nLLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,\nillustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,\nand interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.\nLLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate\neffectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external\nknowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven\narchitectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of\nconventional pipelines.

With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the\nGrant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support\nmassive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces\nsignificant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for\nactivity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we\npropose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method\nfirst employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)\napproach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data\nportions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid\nVariational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint\ndata detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the\nproposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced\nsensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a\nfinite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated\nposterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing\n(MP) algorithm from diverging.

We\ndemonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating\na disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,\nevaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module.

In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are\nbenchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the\ncurrent FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,\nparticularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding\nmodels. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding\nvectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv\nrepository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and\ncategories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and\nfind that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single\napproach performs best across all scenarios.

The first\nproposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures\nthe structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given\ndigits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku\nsolvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking\nalgorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number\nof times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a\nrandomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand\nSudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty\nlevel in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics\nand website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation\ncoefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a\nuniversal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the\ntwo proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both\nindividual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku\nwebsites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and\nUniversal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku\nwebsites.

Furthermore, our Large\nLanguage Model-based A/B testing methodology, conducted with 300 simulated\nusers, reveals that 72.7% of long-term users prefer exploratory recommendations\nover purely exploitative ones, providing strong evidence for the system's\nability to promote meaningful content discovery without sacrificing user\nsatisfaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u7535\u5f71\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6c14\u6ce1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53e5\u5b50\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u5185\u5bb9\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u63a8\u8350\u5217\u8868\u5185\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4ece0.34\u964d\u81f30.26\uff0c\u610f\u5916\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.73\uff0c72.7%\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u610f\u5916\u6027\u3002"}}

While many state-of-the-art\nANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes\ncreates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn\nnecessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical\nindex implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is\nserialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based\nindexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize\nthe index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is\neither embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads\nthe data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that\nmaps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the\nindex easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The\ndisadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of\nsearching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe\nthis performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a\nfile-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A\ncomparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the\nimplementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not\nconstrained.

Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two\ncategories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies\ntoo well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which\ncan suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to\ncouple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate\nobjectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit\ntheir expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically\nsolvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly\naligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated\non two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI\nsubtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,\nhyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,\nnon-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a\nmore clinically relevant scenario.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local\nConnectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive\nglobal and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,\nwe propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn\nglobal segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.\nThis enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while\nmaintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight\nDual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation\nquality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on\nboth 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy\nand continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

We propose Maximum a\nPosteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from\npreferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the\noptimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum\nLikelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating\nprior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.\nThis not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by\nmitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More\nimportantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports\npreference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO\ncan be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including\nwidely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO.

To\nalleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative\nPerceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to\nmine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object\ndetection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial\nrepresentations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a\npipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density\ninformation (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,\nwe employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained\nlocal features according to distinct object properties.

While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting\nfeatures into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain\npriors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a\nProbabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of\nexisting segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF\nintroduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this\nprior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.\nTo achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and\nutilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain\nshifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the\nLatent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the\nDomain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate\ndomain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion\nprocess to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design\nenables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature\nrepresentations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and\nchallenging urban scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "PDAF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u6269\u6563\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57df\u5e7f\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u56e0\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u5148\u9a8c\uff08LDP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff08LPE\u3001DCM\u3001DPE\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8865\u507f\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86PDAF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PDAF\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse\nmultiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation\nfrom the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide\ndeterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent\nambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane\nmarkings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages\nthe diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized\nmaps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,\nMapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a\nBEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples.

Extensive experiments\non the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in\nsingle-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples\nconsistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit\nof distribution modeling.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the\nInternet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating\nvarious forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language\nmodels (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple\nIMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents\ndifferent business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on\nmultiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes\nvarious IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two\nprimary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA\nobjectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in\nresource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we\npropose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich\nstructured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We\npartition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to\nfacilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning\nprocedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking\nphases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better\nadaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks.

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we\ndevise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select\nreliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of\nunlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,\nincluding two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and\npancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a\nchallenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features\ncomplicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches.

Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for\nlinguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational\ndecisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene\nrepresentation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their\ncomprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to\nbehaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose\na navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual\nperceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic\ngrounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as\ncompact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are\nproposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions\nand semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric\ndetails.

However, most existing works focus on generating\nimages of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to\nvisualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes\nvariously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct\nappearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic\ninconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of\nprevious step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in\nsequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization\nmodel, called Chain-of-Cooking.

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake\ndetection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online\nsynthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the\ncommon belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance\ndetection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to\ngradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between\nsource domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this\nissue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework\nthat explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.\nFirst, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update\nvector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the\noriginal and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search\nprocess into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update\nvector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.\nSecond, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict\nfeature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss\npenalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of\nrepresentations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and\nCGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and\nrepresentation learning.

The Sun and fixed stars are the\ntwo primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical\ncomponents for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,\nsun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude\ndetermination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft\ncoordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due\nto the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are\nsmall, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of\nthe sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of\nuncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and\ninterference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration\nalgorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve\naccuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have\nbeen explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is\ncurrently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of\nwork. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling\nand calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It\nspecifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an\nanalysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun\nsensor modeling and calibration techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5728\u822a\u5929\u5668\u59ff\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6821\u51c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u592a\u9633\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Chess, a\nlong-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal\ntestbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human\nbehavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,\nmaking them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we\nintroduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual\ndecision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves\nthis through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which\nbridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a\nprototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages\nability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual\nembeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can\naccurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high\nfidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior\nmodeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in\nchess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,\nrepresenting a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an\nexample of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users\nusing a prototype-enriched model as a bridge.

While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in\ncapturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy\nwith very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context\nwindow). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory\nenabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences\nmore efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike\ntraditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving\ndifferential equations through continuous integration, making training and\ninference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In\nthis paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for\naccelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed\nto enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based\nmodels for long-range sequence tasks.

By leveraging the LIMA-PE\nmicroarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in\nperformance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x\nincrease in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around\n~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel\noperations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEpochCore\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5fae\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982RNN\u3001CNN\u548cTransformer\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4fdd\u7559\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800cSSMs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u52a8\u9635\u5217\uff08SAs\uff09\u7684EpochCore\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5f15\u5165LIMA-PE\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u548cProDF\u6570\u636e\u6d41\uff0c\u4f18\u5316SSM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "EpochCore\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u80fd\u6548\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86250\u500d\u548c45\u500d\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9762\u79ef\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a02\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728LRA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4GPU\u5185\u6838\u64cd\u4f5c\u5feb\u7ea62000\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "EpochCore\u4e3aSSM\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce LinDeps,\na novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top\nof any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant\nfilters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted\nQR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent\nfilters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's\nkernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any\nfine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning.

Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest\nadvancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.\n  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS\nwith image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and\nlevels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of\napplying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that\nremains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the\nlimitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions\nfor future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already\nfamiliar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their\nunderstanding of current advances and methodological innovations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff08WSSS\uff09\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7efc\u8ff0\u672a\u80fd\u6db5\u76d6\u6700\u65b0\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u719f\u6089WSSS\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u6df1\u5165\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

To solve\nthis problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy\n(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of\ntraining time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP\n(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework\nthat eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to\nexpedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes\nobservation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database\nof expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is\nembedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted.

During communication, each\nclient retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's\ncoordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both\nembedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution\nclients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive\nexperiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte\nachieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only\nnegligible communication and computation costs.

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a\npromising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,\nexploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural\ninformation. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information\nto prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only\non LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,\ntext-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:\nmulti-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to\nrapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These\nneighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the\nprompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading\nperformance.

Yet this very nature also\nmakes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML\nmodels, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical\nabstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these\nissues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a\nline of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.\nthe fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we\nanalyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of\nclassification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are\nequivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying\nthe properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their\nboundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By\nparameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that\nthey satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be\nused to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.\nMoreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the\nmulticlass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the\nclass assignments.

Despite rapid advancements, a\nsubstantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of\ninternal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency\nand efficiency.

The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head\nself-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)\nlayers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics\ngIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and\nregression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and\nfuture research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings\nreveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive\nto ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable\nattention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to\nits look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across\nblocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in\nDDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model\nsimplification without sacrificing performance.

Existing methods can be\nroughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where\nthe former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the\nlatter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,\nshowing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some\nmethods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the\ntracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the\nrest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail\nto overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not\nhave any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle\nthem, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,\nincluding: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the\nfeature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,\nand select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of\noccluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,\ntheir scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept\nerror propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the\nimpacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to\nprovide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate\ntracking.

Among binary causal methods, most methods based\non additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal\nmodel.

Therefore, on observation\ndata, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference\nmodel (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality.

However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with\nlimited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises\nconcerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by\nthe remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the\nfirst mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,\ngrounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the\nunique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend\nthe original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By\nleveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully\ncomplex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention\nand residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the\nmodel's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,\nwe introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that\nenhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of\n19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against\nseven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving\ndifferent RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on\npar with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full\nmathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the\ncomplex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average\nclassification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across\ndiverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE.

In a large-scale\n10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad\nvariations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%\n(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.\nThis represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on\nFacebook.

Multiple\nrepresentations of the signal are created and visualized as waveforms, and they\nare jointly visualized within a single multi-representation diagram. Extensive\nexperiments incorporating various processing and filtering techniques, along\nwith multiple representation combinations, demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.

Existing RGB-D VSOD models\nhave different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion\ninformation explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and\npromising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to\neffectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.\nPrevious methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to\nmodel designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in\nindividual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address\nthis issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel\nselective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a\npixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of\noptical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose\na multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused\nfeatures derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple\ndimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined\nfeatures.

We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop\nto several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period\nsystems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory\nmanagement, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL\napproach learns policies across products using only historical information that\nwould be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand\ndistributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our\ngeneric DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms\nestablished benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while\nrequiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned\npolicies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known\nstructural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations\nresearch methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,\nwe propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly\nincorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the\nlearning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to\nthe policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with\nrealistic demand data.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\\%\naccuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90.

Electrocardiograms\n(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.\nThese are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is\ntime-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area\nhas focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent\ndeep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most\nECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to\nclassify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method\nwas the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science\nChallenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual\nnoise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform\npatterns.

Our results reveal that current\nmethods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the\nassociated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion\nAppearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsuperior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid\nfoundation for future research in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\uff08FSVOS\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6MOVE\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5DMA\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FSVOS\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684FSVOS\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDMA\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfcFSVOS\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Although CLIP is successfully trained on\nbillion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training\nfurther to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no\ncuration method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)\nthe English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its\nEnglish-only counterpart, i.e., \"curse of multilinguality\" that is common in\nLLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch\non worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct\nrigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above\nchallenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and\nnon-English world data.
