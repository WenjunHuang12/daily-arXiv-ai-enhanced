### [1] [Approximating Multiple-Depot Capacitated Vehicle Routing via LP Rounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05321)
*Zachary Friggstad,Tobias Mömke*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了基于新LP松弛的3.9365近似算法解决带容量限制的多仓库车辆路径问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带容量限制的多仓库车辆路径问题(CVRP-MD)，该问题在实际物流和配送系统中具有重要应用价值

Method: 基于新的LP松弛进行舍入，构建近似算法

Result: 获得了3.9365的近似比

Conclusion: 新LP松弛方法为CVRP-MD问题提供了有效的近似解决方案

Abstract: In Capacitated Vehicle Routing with Multiple Depots (CVRP-MD) we are given a
set of client locations $C$ and a set of depots $R$ located in a metric space
with costs $c(i,j)$ between $u,v \in C \cup R$. Additionally, we are given a
capacity bound $k$. The goal is to find a collection of tours of minimum total
cost such that each tour starts and ends at some depot $r \in R$ and includes
at most $k$ clients and such that each client lies on at least one tour. Our
main result is a $3.9365$-approximation based on rounding a new LP relaxation
for CVRP-MD.

### [2] [Time To Replace Your Filter: How Maplets Simplify System Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05518)
*Michael A. Bender,Alex Conway,Martín Farach-Colton,Rob Johnson,Prashant Pandey*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出maplets作为空间高效的近似键值映射数据结构，比传统过滤器更适合需要关联小值的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过滤器（如Bloom、quotient、cuckoo过滤器）只能提供近似集合成员测试，但许多应用需要关联键值对，这迫使开发者采用复杂的工作方案，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过SplinterDB（LSM键值存储）、Squeakr（k-mer计数器）和Mantis（基因组序列搜索）三个案例研究，识别共同模式并展示统一maplet抽象如何简化设计。

Result: maplets在保持过滤器空间效率的同时，原生支持键值关联，并提供单边错误保证，能带来更简单的设计和更好的性能。

Conclusion: 在数据库、计算生物学和网络等领域，应用应该默认使用maplets而不是过滤器。

Abstract: Filters such as Bloom, quotient, and cuckoo filters are fundamental building
blocks providing space-efficient approximate set membership testing. However,
many applications need to associate small values with keys-functionality that
filters do not provide. This mismatch forces complex workarounds that degrade
performance. We argue that maplets-space-efficient data structures for
approximate key-value mappings-are the right abstraction. A maplet provides the
same space benefits as filters while natively supporting key-value associations
with one-sided error guarantees. Through detailed case studies of SplinterDB
(LSM-based key-value store), Squeakr (k-mer counter), and Mantis (genomic
sequence search), we identify the common patterns and demonstrate how a unified
maplet abstraction can lead to simpler designs and better performance. We
conclude that applications benefit from defaulting to maplets rather than
filters across domains including databases, computational biology, and
networking.

### [3] [Parameterized Complexity of Temporal Connected Components: Treewidth and k-Path Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05806)
*Argyrios Deligkas,Michelle Döring,Eduard Eiben,Tiger-Lily Goldsmith,George Skretas,Georg Tennigkeit*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了时序图中最大时序连通组件的参数化复杂度，考虑了开放和封闭两种类型，分析了树宽和时序路径数等参数对问题复杂性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究时序图中最大连通组件的计算复杂性，特别关注结构参数（树宽）和时序参数（时序路径数）如何影响问题的可解性。

Method: 通过参数化复杂度分析，考察树宽(tw)和时序路径数(tpn)等参数对开放时序连通组件(openTCC)和封闭时序连通组件(closedTCC)问题的影响。

Result: 发现单独使用树宽或时序路径数不足以实现固定参数可解性：当tw=9时两个问题都是NP难的，当tpn=6时closedTCC是NP难的。但openTCC在tpn参数化下属于XP类。当结合多个参数时，问题变得固定参数可解。

Conclusion: 时序图中的最大连通组件问题在单独使用结构或时序参数时通常难以处理，但通过参数组合可以实现高效算法设计。

Abstract: We study the parameterized complexity of maximum temporal connected
components (tccs) in temporal graphs, i.e., graphs that deterministically
change over time. In a tcc, any pair of vertices must be able to reach each
other via a time-respecting path. We consider both problems of maximum open
tccs (openTCC), which allow temporal paths through vertices outside the
component, and closed tccs (closedTCC) which require at least one temporal path
entirely within the component for every pair. We focus on the structural
parameter of treewidth, tw, and the recently introduced temporal parameter of
temporal path number, tpn, which is the minimum number of paths needed to fully
describe a temporal graph. We prove that these parameters on their own are not
sufficient for fixed parameter tractability: both openTCC and closedTCC are
NP-hard even when tw=9, and closedTCC is NP-hard when tpn=6. In contrast, we
prove that openTCC is in XP when parameterized by tpn. On the positive side, we
show that both problem become fixed parameter tractable under various
combinations of structural and temporal parameters that include, tw plus tpn,
tw plus the lifetime of the graph, and tw plus the maximum temporal degree.

### [4] [Improved Streaming Algorithm for Fair $k$-Center Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05937)
*Longkun Guo,Zeyu Lin,Chaoqi Jia,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于流式公平k中心聚类的单遍算法，通过λ独立中心集结构实现5倍近似比，仅需O(k log n)内存，并能扩展到离线公平k中心问题和半结构化数据流场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要在k中心聚类中加入公平约束，确保每个群体有中心数量上限，且需要处理大数据流式场景。

Method: 使用λ独立中心集结构，在流式过程中保留点集，后处理时通过分析三种情况并转化为特殊约束的顶点覆盖问题来选择中心。

Result: 算法达到紧致的5倍近似比，内存消耗O(k log n)，在离线公平k中心问题上达到3倍近似比，在半结构化数据流中分别实现3倍(m=2)和4倍(m一般)近似比。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在聚类成本和运行效率上优于现有基线，能有效处理流式公平k中心聚类问题。

Abstract: Many real-world applications pose challenges in incorporating fairness
constraints into the $k$-center clustering problem, where the dataset consists
of $m$ demographic groups, each with a specified upper bound on the number of
centers to ensure fairness. Focusing on big data scenarios, this paper
addresses the problem in a streaming setting, where data points arrive one by
one sequentially in a continuous stream. Leveraging a structure called the
$\lambda$-independent center set, we propose a one-pass streaming algorithm
that first computes a reserved set of points during the streaming process.
Then, for the post-streaming process, we propose an approach for selecting
centers from the reserved point set by analyzing all three possible cases,
transforming the most complicated one into a specially constrained vertex cover
problem in an auxiliary graph. Our algorithm achieves a tight approximation
ratio of 5 while consuming $O(k\log n)$ memory. It can also be readily adapted
to solve the offline fair $k$-center problem, achieving a 3-approximation ratio
that matches the current state of the art. Furthermore, we extend our approach
to a semi-structured data stream, where data points from each group arrive in
batches. In this setting, we present a 3-approximation algorithm for $m = 2$
and a 4-approximation algorithm for general $m$. Lastly, we conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate the performance of our approaches, demonstrating that
they outperform existing baselines in both clustering cost and runtime
efficiency.

### [5] [Efficient Heuristics and Exact Methods for Pairwise Interaction Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05955)
*Sándor P. Fekete,Phillip Keldenich,Dominik Krupke,Michael Perk*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了软件配置测试中的成对交互采样问题，旨在找到最小配置集合来覆盖所有特征对组合，证明了该问题的BH难度，并提出了实用方法解决了包含约5亿可行交互的大型实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代可配置软件系统（如汽车行业）的测试需求，需要高效解决成对交互采样这一基础优化问题，该问题在软件工程领域已有20多年研究历史。

Method: 结合新的理论洞察（证明BH难度）和实用技术贡献，开发了能够处理大规模配置空间的优化方法。

Result: 能够解决已发布基准集中最大的实例（约5亿可行交互）并达到可证明的最优性，而先前方法甚至无法计算可行解。

Conclusion: 该研究在理论和实践层面都取得了显著进展，为软件配置测试提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在处理大规模实例方面表现突出。

Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems that are fundamental to testing
in modern configurable software systems, e.g., in automotive industries. In
pairwise interaction sampling, we are given a (potentially very large)
configuration space, in which each dimension corresponds to a possible Boolean
feature of a software system; valid configurations are the satisfying
assignments of a given propositional formula $\varphi$. The objective is to
find a minimum-sized family of configurations, such that each pair of features
is jointly tested at least once. Due to its relevance in Software Engineering,
this problem has been studied extensively for over 20 years. In addition to new
theoretical insights (we prove BH-hardness), we provide a broad spectrum of key
contributions on the practical side that allow substantial progress for the
practical performance. Remarkably, we are able to solve the largest instances
we found in published benchmark sets (with about 500000000 feasible
interactions) to provable optimality. Previous approaches were not even able to
compute feasible solutions.

### [6] [Fast-Convergent Proximity Graphs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05975)
*Binhong Li,Xiao Yan,Shangqi Lu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的邻近图结构α-CG，通过精心设计的边剪枝规则，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升近似最近邻搜索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于邻近图的近似最近邻搜索方法虽然实证性能优越，但缺乏理论保证，特别是在最坏情况下无法确保查询结果质量。

Method: 引入α-收敛图(α-CG)，使用基于移位缩放三角不等式的边剪枝规则；开发了实用的α-收敛邻域图(α-CNG)变体，并在局部应用剪枝规则；优化索引构建时间。

Result: 实验显示α-CNG在真实数据集上优于现有邻近图方法，在多数数据集上距离计算次数减少超过15%，搜索步骤减少超过45%。

Conclusion: α-CG/α-CNG方法在保持理论保证的同时，显著提升了近似最近邻搜索的效率和性能，为高维度量空间中的近似最近邻搜索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional metric spaces
is a fundamental problem with many applications. Over the past decade,
proximity graph (PG)-based indexes have demonstrated superior empirical
performance over alternatives. However, these methods often lack theoretical
guarantees regarding the quality of query results, especially in the worst-case
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the {\alpha}-convergent graph
({\alpha}-CG), a new PG structure that employs a carefully designed edge
pruning rule. This rule eliminates candidate neighbors for each data point p by
applying the shifted-scaled triangle inequalities among p, its existing
out-neighbors, and new candidates. If the distance between the query point q
and its exact nearest neighbor v* is at most {\tau} for some constant {\tau} >
0, our {\alpha}-CG finds the exact nearest neighbor in poly-logarithmic time,
assuming bounded intrinsic dimensionality for the dataset; otherwise, it can
find an ANN in the same time. To enhance scalability, we develop the
{\alpha}-convergent neighborhood graph ({\alpha}-CNG), a practical variant that
applies the pruning rule locally within each point's neighbors. We also
introduce optimizations to reduce the index construction time. Experimental
results show that our {\alpha}-CNG outperforms existing PGs on real-world
datasets. For most datasets, {\alpha}-CNG can reduce the number of distance
computations and search steps by over 15% and 45%, respectively, when compared
with the best-performing baseline.

### [7] [A Finer View of the Parameterized Landscape of Labeled Graph Contractions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06102)
*Yashaswini Mathur,Prafullkumar Tale*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了带标签图收缩问题，提出了基于树宽的构造性FPT算法，证明了平方树宽的下界，并改进了基于收缩次数和退化度的参数化算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lafond和Marchand在WADS 2025中启动了该问题的参数化复杂性研究，但他们的树宽参数化算法是非构造性的。本文旨在提供构造性算法并改进现有结果。

Method: 提出了基于树宽的构造性固定参数算法，运行时间为2^O(tw²)·|V(G)|^O(1)。同时研究了基于收缩次数和退化度的参数化方法。

Result: 证明了算法在树宽参数下的最优性（除非ETH失败），展示了问题在有限最大度图上的NP完全性，并改进了基于(k+δ(G))的FPT算法。

Conclusion: 带标签图收缩问题具有丰富的参数化复杂性结构，在树宽参数下达到了最优算法复杂度，并扩展了对该问题计算复杂性的理解。

Abstract: We study the \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} problem, where the input
consists of two vertex-labeled graphs $G$ and $H$, and the goal is to determine
whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ via a sequence of edge contractions.
  Lafond and Marchand~[WADS 2025] initiated the parameterized complexity study
of this problem, showing it to be \(\W[1]\)-hard when parameterized by the
number \(k\) of allowed contractions. They also proved that the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the tree-width \(\tw\) of
\(G\), via an application of Courcelle's theorem resulting in a
non-constructive algorithm.
  In this work, we present a constructive fixed-parameter algorithm for
\textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with running time \(2^{\mathcal{O}(\tw^2)}
\cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). We also prove that unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis (\ETH) fails, it does not admit an algorithm running in time
\(2^{o(\tw^2)} \cdot |V(G)|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\). This result adds
\textsc{Labeled Contractibility} to a small list of problems that admit such a
lower bound and matching algorithm.
  We further strengthen existing hardness results by showing that the problem
remains \NP-complete even when both input graphs have bounded maximum degree.
We also investigate parameterizations by \((k + \delta(G))\) where
\(\delta(G)\) denotes the degeneracy of \(G\), and rule out the existence of
subexponential-time algorithms. This answers question raised in Lafond and
Marchand~[WADS 2025]. We additionally provide an improved \FPT\ algorithm with
better dependence on \((k + \delta(G))\) than previously known. Finally, we
analyze a brute-force algorithm for \textsc{Labeled Contractibility} with
running time \(|V(H)|^{\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|)}\), and show that this running time
is optimal under \ETH.

### [8] [Local Search-based Individually Fair Clustering with Outliers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06130)
*Binita Maity,Shrutimoy Das,Anirban Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部搜索的算法，用于处理包含异常值的个体公平聚类问题，通过丢弃异常点并计算剩余点的公平中心集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当数据集包含异常值时，现有的个体公平聚类方法可能对非异常点产生次优结果，需要专门处理异常值以提高聚类质量。

Method: 使用随机化局部搜索方法，先标记并丢弃异常点，然后为剩余的非异常点计算公平中心集。

Result: 该方法具有良好的近似保证，并限制了丢弃的异常点数量，在真实数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的局部搜索算法能够有效处理包含异常值的个体公平聚类问题，具有良好的可扩展性和理论保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a local search-based algorithm for individually
fair clustering in the presence of outliers. We consider the individual
fairness definition proposed in Jung et al., which requires that each of the
$n$ points in the dataset must have one of the $k$ centers within its $n/k$
nearest neighbors. However, if the dataset is known to contain outliers, the
set of fair centers obtained under this definition might be suboptimal for
non-outlier points. In order to address this issue, we propose a method that
discards a set of points marked as outliers and computes the set of fair
centers for the remaining non-outlier points. Our method utilizes a randomized
variant of local search, which makes it scalable to large datasets. We also
provide an approximation guarantee of our method as well as a bound on the
number of outliers discarded. Additionally, we demonstrate our claims
experimentally on a set of real-world datasets.

### [9] [Scalable In-context Ranking with Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05396)
*Nilesh Gupta,Chong You,Srinadh Bhojanapalli,Sanjiv Kumar,Inderjit Dhillon,Felix Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: BlockRank是一种新颖的上下文排序方法，通过利用LLM注意力中的块稀疏性和查询-文档块相关性，将注意力复杂度从二次降低到线性，同时提高检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文排序(ICR)虽然有效，但随着候选文档数量的增加，注意力操作的二次/超线性扩展导致效率成为显著挑战。

Method: 识别并利用LLM注意力中的两个结构：(1)文档间块稀疏性；(2)查询-文档块相关性。通过架构强制块稀疏性并使用辅助对比训练目标优化相关性。

Result: 在BEIR、MSMarco和NQ数据集上，FLARE Mistral匹配或优于现有SOTA列表排序器，推理效率提高4.7倍，可扩展到500个文档的上下文长度。

Conclusion: BlockRank为ICR提供了一个可扩展且有效的解决方案，能够优雅地扩展到长上下文短列表，在约100K上下文长度内一秒内处理约500个文档。

Abstract: In-context Ranking (ICR) is an emerging paradigm for Information Retrieval
(IR), which leverages contextual understanding of LLMs by directly
incorporating the task description, candidate documents, and the query into the
model's input prompt and tasking the LLM to identify relevant document(s).
While it is effective, efficiency is a significant challenge in this paradigm,
especially as the candidate list grows due to quadratic/super-linear scaling of
attention operation with context length. To this end, this paper first
identifies inherent and exploitable structures in the attention of LLMs
finetuned for ICR: (1) inter-document block sparsity: attention is dense within
each document block but sparse across different documents in the context; and
(2) query-document block relevance: the attention scores from certain query
tokens to a document block in middle layers strongly correlate with that
document's actual relevance. Motivated by these observations, we introduce
BlockRank (Blockwise In-context Ranking), a novel method that adapts the
attention operation in an LLM by (a) architecturally enforcing the observed
inter-document block sparsity, reducing attention complexity from quadratic to
linear without loss in performance, and (b) optimizing query-document block
relevance for true relevant documents during fine-tuning using an auxiliary
contrastive training objective, improving retrieval in attention. Experiments
on BEIR, MSMarco and NQ with Mistral-7B demonstrate that FLARE Mistral matches
or outperforms existing SOTA listwise rankers and controlled fine-tuned
baseline while being significantly more efficient at inference (4.7x for 100
MSMarco documents in context) and scaling gracefully to long-context
shortlists, around 500 documents in-context (approximately 100K context length)
within a second, presenting a scalable and effective solution for ICR.

TL;DR: 提出基于NLP和机器学习的自动化研究论文分类与推荐框架，在arXiv数据集上测试多种特征提取方法和分类器，逻辑回归+TF-IDF组合效果最佳（准确率69%），并集成基于余弦相似度的推荐模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字时代科学出版物激增导致研究人员难以高效识别和获取相关工作的挑战，应对数字图书馆中的信息过载问题。

Method: 使用大规模arXiv数据集，评估多种特征提取方法（TF-IDF、Count Vectorizer、Sentence-BERT、USE、Mirror-BERT）与机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、SVM、朴素贝叶斯、随机森林、梯度提升树、k近邻）的组合。

Result: 逻辑回归与TF-IDF组合在分类任务中表现最佳，达到69%的准确率。推荐模块基于向量化文章的余弦相似度实现高效相关论文检索。

Conclusion: 该系统为数字图书馆信息过载问题提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，有效支持文献发现过程。

Abstract: In the digital era, the exponential growth of scientific publications has
made it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently identify and
access relevant work. This paper presents an automated framework for research
article classification and recommendation that leverages Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. Using a large-scale arXiv.org
dataset spanning more than three decades, we evaluate multiple feature
extraction approaches (TF--IDF, Count Vectorizer, Sentence-BERT, USE,
Mirror-BERT) in combination with diverse machine learning classifiers (Logistic
Regression, SVM, Na\"ive Bayes, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and
k-Nearest Neighbour). Our experiments show that Logistic Regression with
TF--IDF consistently yields the best classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 69\%. To complement classification, we incorporate a recommendation
module based on the cosine similarity of vectorized articles, enabling
efficient retrieval of related research papers. The proposed system directly
addresses the challenge of information overload in digital libraries and
demonstrates a scalable, data-driven solution to support literature discovery.

*Mingdai Yang,Nurendra Choudhary,Jiangshu Du,Edward W. Huang,Philip S. Yu,Karthik Subbian,Danai Kourta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出AgenDR框架，将LLM推理与可扩展推荐工具结合，通过关系推理提升推荐相关性，同时避免幻觉问题和大规模目录排序挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代理的推荐框架存在幻觉虚构物品和全目录排序困难的问题，且未充分利用LLM的常识推理能力来捕捉物品间的替代和互补关系。

Method: AgenDR框架将全排序任务委托给传统模型，利用LLM：(i)基于个性化工具适用性整合多个推荐输出；(ii)基于用户历史进行替代和互补关系推理。

Result: 在三个公共杂货数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的全排序性能，平均比其底层工具提升两倍。

Conclusion: AgenDR框架通过结合LLM推理和传统推荐工具，有效缓解了幻觉问题，扩展到大规模目录，并通过关系推理增强了推荐相关性。

Abstract: Recent agent-based recommendation frameworks aim to simulate user behaviors
by incorporating memory mechanisms and prompting strategies, but they struggle
with hallucinating non-existent items and full-catalog ranking. Besides, a
largely underexplored opportunity lies in leveraging LLMs'commonsense reasoning
to capture user intent through substitute and complement relationships between
items, which are usually implicit in datasets and difficult for traditional
ID-based recommenders to capture. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-agent
framework, AgenDR, which bridges LLM reasoning with scalable recommendation
tools. Our approach delegates full-ranking tasks to traditional models while
utilizing LLMs to (i) integrate multiple recommendation outputs based on
personalized tool suitability and (ii) reason over substitute and complement
relationships grounded in user history. This design mitigates hallucination,
scales to large catalogs, and enhances recommendation relevance through
relational reasoning. Through extensive experiments on three public grocery
datasets, we show that our framework achieves superior full-ranking
performance, yielding on average a twofold improvement over its underlying
tools. We also introduce a new LLM-based evaluation metric that jointly
measures semantic alignment and ranking correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话推荐系统的交互特性给自动评估带来挑战，当前评估方法存在过度依赖静态测试集和现有指标不足的问题，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 分析真实用户交互数据，探索用户模拟生成动态交互数据，并提出基于奖励/成本框架的新评估指标。

Conclusion: 用户模拟和新的评估指标为CRS评估提供了重要进展，但在模拟技术和评估指标方面仍需进一步研究和完善。

Abstract: Research and development on conversational recommender systems (CRSs)
critically depends on sound and reliable evaluation methodologies. However, the
interactive nature of these systems poses significant challenges for automatic
evaluation. This paper critically examines current evaluation practices and
identifies two key limitations: the over-reliance on static test collections
and the inadequacy of existing evaluation metrics. To substantiate this
critique, we analyze real user interactions with nine existing CRSs and
demonstrate a striking disconnect between self-reported user satisfaction and
performance scores reported in prior literature. To address these limitations,
this work explores the potential of user simulation to generate dynamic
interaction data, offering a departure from static datasets. Furthermore, we
propose novel evaluation metrics, based on a general reward/cost framework,
designed to better align with real user satisfaction. Our analysis of different
simulation approaches provides valuable insights into their effectiveness and
reveals promising initial results, showing improved correlation with system
rankings compared to human evaluation. While these findings indicate a
significant step forward in CRS evaluation, we also identify areas for future
research and refinement in both simulation techniques and evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前新闻推荐系统主要基于用户参与度，缺乏对多样性的考虑，存在规范理论与技术实现之间的差距。需要关注训练数据集以实际实现多样性感知的推荐系统。

Method: 识别开发多样性感知新闻推荐系统所需的数据集信息，评估现有公共数据集的局限性，分析欧洲法律政策如何为研究人员提供数据访问途径。

Result: 确定了构建多样性推荐系统所需的关键数据要素，揭示了当前公共数据集在支持多样性研究方面的不足，提出了利用欧洲法律政策获取必要数据的可行性。

Conclusion: 实现多样性感知的新闻推荐系统需要专门的数据集支持，欧洲法律政策为获取这些数据提供了可能途径，这对弥合规范理论与技术实现之间的差距至关重要。

Abstract: News recommender systems increasingly determine what news individuals see
online. Over the past decade, researchers have extensively critiqued
recommender systems that prioritise news based on user engagement. To offer an
alternative, researchers have analysed how recommender systems could support
the media's ability to fulfil its role in democratic society by recommending
news based on editorial values, particularly diversity. However, there
continues to be a large gap between normative theory on how news recommender
systems should incorporate diversity, and technical literature that designs
such systems. We argue that to realise diversity-aware recommender systems in
practice, it is crucial to pay attention to the datasets that are needed to
train modern news recommenders. We aim to make two main contributions. First,
we identify the information a dataset must include to enable the development of
the diversity-aware news recommender systems proposed in normative literature.
Based on this analysis, we assess the limitations of currently available public
datasets, and show what potential they do have to expand research into
diversity-aware recommender systems. Second, we analyse why and how European
law and policy can be used to provide researchers with structural access to the
data they need to develop diversity-aware news recommender systems.

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架有效提升了安全通信性能，为安全无线通信系统设计提供了新思路，特别是在ISAC系统中实现了安全与感知的平衡。

Abstract: This paper considers a cooperative jamming (CJ)-aided secure wireless
communication system. Conventionally, the jammer transmits Gaussian noise (GN)
to enhance security; however, the GN scheme also degrades the legitimate
receiver's performance. Encoded jamming (EJ) mitigates this interference but
does not always outperform GN under varying channel conditions. To address this
limitation, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with EJ to maximize the secrecy rate.
In the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case, we adopt a semidefinite
relaxation (SDR)-based alternating optimization method, while in the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case, we develop an alternating
optimization algorithm based on the weighted sum mean-square-error minimization
(WMMSE) scheme. Furthermore, we are the first to incorporate EJ into an
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, characterizing the Pareto
boundary between secrecy rate and sensing mutual information (MI) by solving
the resulting joint optimization problem using a modified WMMSE-based
algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes significantly
outperform benchmark methods in secrecy rate across diverse channel conditions
and clearly reveal the trade-off between security and sensing.

Motivation: 虽然自对偶二进制线性码在n≤40时已被广泛研究和分类，但对于在非点积内积下与自身正交补重合的线性码研究较少。

Method: 在F_2^n上定义交替形式，研究相对于该形式的最大全迷向码，并推导MacWilliams型恒等式。

Result: 对n≤24的最大全迷向码进行了分类，建立了权重枚举器与其交替正交补权重枚举器之间的关系。

Conclusion: 得到了最大全迷向码权重枚举器的约束条件，扩展了自对偶码的研究框架。

Abstract: Self-dual binary linear codes have been extensively studied and classified
for length n <= 40. However, little attention has been paid to linear codes
that coincide with their orthogonal complement when the underlying inner
product is not the dot product. In this paper, we introduce an alternating form
defined on F_2^n and study codes that are maximal totally isotropic with
repsect to this form. We classify such codes for n <= 24 and present a
MacWilliams-type identity which relates the weight enumerator of a linear code
and that of its orthogonal complement with respect to our alternating inner
product. As an application, we derive constraints on the weight enumerators of
maximal totally isotropic codes.

Motivation: 为非线性高斯噪声信道中的互信息估计提供一种实用且高效的方法，解决传统方法在复杂非线性场景下的局限性。

Method: 使用去噪分数匹配学习估计信道输出的分数函数，通过de Bruijn恒等式和I-MMSE关系将分数转换为Fisher信息，进而通过积分表示估计互信息。

Result: 数值实验表明该方法在各种先验和信道非线性下都能准确估计互信息，与闭式解和核密度估计基线相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的Score-to-Fisher桥接方法为非线性高斯噪声信道中的互信息估计提供了实用且高效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We present a numerical method to evaluate mutual information (MI) in
nonlinear Gaussian noise channels by using denoising score matching learning
for estimating the score function of channel output. Via de Bruijn identity and
the I--MMSE relation, Fisher information estimated from the learned score
yields accurate estimates of MI through an integral representation of MI for a
variety of priors and channel nonlinearities (e.g., elementwise nonlinearity).
In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the
Score-to-Fisher bridge methodology, along with practical guidelines for its
implementation. We also conduct extensive validation experiments, comparing our
approach with closed-form solutions and a kernel density estimation baseline.
The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
is both practical and efficient for mutual information estimation in nonlinear
Gaussian noise channels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信道模拟和分布式匹配这两个机器学习中的基础问题，探索ERS算法在这些问题中的应用潜力，特别是解决传统拒绝采样方法在分布式场景中的局限性。

Method: 提出基于ERS的新编码方案，建立ERS的分布式匹配引理，将其作为拒绝采样对应物与泊松匹配引理(PML)进行比较，并推广了重要性匹配引理的工作。

Result: 新方案实现了接近最优的编码率，标准RS也能达到类似效果，将Braverman和Garg的结果推广到连续字母表设置，在分布式压缩中表现出优于先前工作的性能。

Conclusion: ERS在信道模拟和分布式匹配中具有显著优势，为拒绝采样类算法在分布式场景中的应用提供了新的理论框架和实用方案。

Abstract: We study channel simulation and distributed matching, two fundamental
problems with several applications to machine learning, using a recently
introduced generalization of the standard rejection sampling (RS) algorithm
known as Ensemble Rejection Sampling (ERS). For channel simulation, we propose
a new coding scheme based on ERS that achieves a near-optimal coding rate. In
this process, we demonstrate that standard RS can also achieve a near-optimal
coding rate and generalize the result of Braverman and Garg (2014) to the
continuous alphabet setting. Next, as our main contribution, we present a
distributed matching lemma for ERS, which serves as the rejection sampling
counterpart to the Poisson Matching Lemma (PML) introduced by Li and Anantharam
(2021). Our result also generalizes a recent work on importance matching lemma
(Phan et al, 2024) and, to our knowledge, is the first result on distributed
matching in the family of rejection sampling schemes where the matching
probability is close to PML. We demonstrate the practical significance of our
approach over prior works by applying it to distributed compression. The
effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated through experiments involving
synthetic Gaussian sources and distributed image compression using the MNIST
dataset.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: SALAD是一种仅使用ACK/NACK反馈的自适应链路适配算法，通过最小化交叉熵损失来推断SINR，并采用假设测试选择MCS，在5G测试中比标准OLLA算法提高15%吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要最大化频谱效率同时确保可靠性，现有链路适配方法在跟踪SINR变化方面存在不足。

Method: 使用ACK/NACK反馈通过交叉熵损失推断SINR，采用自适应的学习率，通过假设测试选择MCS，并包含反馈控制环调整瞬时BLER目标。

Result: 在5G测试平台上，SALAD始终优于行业标准OLLA算法，使用单一参数集在不同流量模式下实现高达15%的吞吐量和频谱效率提升，同时满足BLER目标。

Conclusion: SALAD算法能够有效跟踪SINR演化，实现高频谱效率并保持长期BLER接近期望目标，优于现有标准方法。

Abstract: Adapting the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) to the wireless link quality
is critical for maximizing spectral efficiency while ensuring reliability. We
propose SALAD (self-adaptive link adaptation), an algorithm that exclusively
leverages ACK/NACK feedback to reliably track the evolution of the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), achieving high spectral
efficiency while keeping the long-term block error rate (BLER) near a desired
target. SALAD infers the SINR by minimizing the cross-entropy loss between
received ACK/NACKs and predicted BLER values, with a learning rate that
self-adapts online through knowledge distillation. Based on this inference,
SALAD selects the MCS via hypothesis testing: if the SINR is likely
underestimated, a higher MCS is selected to accelerate link adaptation under
improving channel conditions. To prevent BLER drift from its long-term target,
SALAD incorporates a feedback control loop that adjusts the instantaneous BLER
target. Over-the-air experiments on a 5G testbed demonstrate that SALAD
consistently outperforms the industry-standard outer-loop link adaptation
(OLLA). With a single set of parameters, SALAD achieves up to 15% higher
throughput and spectral efficiency than multiple OLLA variants across different
traffic regimes, while meeting the BLER target.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有极小极大风险和遗憾研究主要关注期望值，忽略了安全关键应用中关键的罕见失败风险。极小极大分位数能够捕捉这些尾部风险，但现有研究存在限制：非交互式估计的限制、缺乏风险水平特定分位数界限的统一交互分析、以及缺乏通用交互协议的分位数特定工具包。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了交互式协议中分位数特定分析工具的空白，为安全关键应用中的风险尾部分析提供了理论工具和实用方法。

Abstract: Minimax risk and regret focus on expectation, missing rare failures critical
in safety-critical bandits and reinforcement learning. Minimax quantiles
capture these tails. Three strands of prior work motivate this study:
minimax-quantile bounds restricted to non-interactive estimation; unified
interactive analyses that focus on expected risk rather than risk level
specific quantile bounds; and high-probability bandit bounds that still lack a
quantile-specific toolkit for general interactive protocols. To close this gap,
within the interactive statistical decision making framework, we develop
high-probability Fano and Le Cam tools and derive risk level explicit
minimax-quantile bounds, including a quantile-to-expectation conversion and a
tight link between strict and lower minimax quantiles. Instantiating these
results for the two-armed Gaussian bandit immediately recovers optimal-rate
bounds.

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{R}_{e,m}$ be a finite commutative chain ring of even
characteristic with maximal ideal $\langle u \rangle$ of nilpotency index $e
\geq 2,$ Teichm$\ddot{u}$ller set $\mathcal{T}_{m},$ and residue field
$\mathcal{R}_{e,m}/\langle u \rangle$ of order $2^m.$ Suppose that $2 \in

guarantees that $Tor_i(\mathcal{C}_e)=\mathcal{D}^{(i)}$ for $1 \leq i \leq
\lceil \frac{e}{2} \rceil.$ By employing this recursive construction method,
together with the results from group theory and finite geometry, we derive
explicit enumeration formulae for all self-orthogonal and self-dual codes of an
arbitrary length over $\mathcal{R}_{e,m}.$ We also demonstrate these results
through examples.

Abstract: Let $\mathscr{R}_{e,m}$ denote a finite commutative chain ring of even

recursive method to construct a self-orthogonal code $\mathscr{D}_e$ of type
$\{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_e\}$ and length $n$ over
$\mathscr{R}_{e,m}$ from a chain $\mathcal{C}^{(1)}\subseteq \mathcal{C}^{(2)}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典的Alon-Edmonds-Luby构造，通过改进的局部坐标线性性质形式化，为随机线性码的去随机化提供系统方法。

Method: 基于Levi、Mosheiff和Shagrithaya（2025）引入的局部坐标线性性质，扩展AEL构造框架，证明如果随机线性码以高概率满足LCL性质的补集，则可以构造显式码满足相同性质。

Result: 首次为列表恢复及其特殊情况（如带擦除的列表恢复、零错误列表恢复、完美哈希矩阵）提供了参数与随机线性码匹配的显式构造。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从概率保证到显式码的系统转换，使显式码在参数优化方面达到与随机设置相同的水平，并且支持基于扩展器的有效（列表）解码。

Abstract: We present a general framework for derandomizing random linear codes with
respect to a broad class of permutation-invariant properties, known as local
properties, which encompass several standard notions such as distance,
list-decoding, list-recovery, and perfect hashing. Our approach extends the
classical Alon-Edmonds-Luby (AEL) construction through a modified formalism of
local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, introduced by Levi, Mosheiff,
and Shagrithaya (2025). The main theorem demonstrates that if random linear
codes satisfy the complement of an LCL property $\mathcal{P}$ with high
probability, then one can construct explicit codes satisfying the complement of
$\mathcal{P}$ as well, with an enlarged yet constant alphabet size. This gives
the first explicit constructions for list recovery, as well as special cases
(e.g., list recovery with erasures, zero-error list recovery, perfect hash
matrices), with parameters matching those of random linear codes. More broadly,
our constructions realize the full range of parameters associated with these
properties at the same level of optimality as in the random setting, thereby
offering a systematic pathway from probabilistic guarantees to explicit codes
that attain them. Furthermore, our derandomization of random linear codes also
admits efficient (list) decoding via recently developed expander-based
decoders.

Motivation: 现实应用中多模态新闻在传播过程中可能丢失部分信息，导致模态不完整，这对现有模型的泛化性和鲁棒性产生不利影响。

Method: MMLNet包含三个关键步骤：(1)多专家协作推理，通过多个专家动态利用互补信息来补偿缺失模态；(2)不完整模态适配器，利用新特征分布补偿缺失信息；(3)模态缺失学习，采用标签感知自适应加权策略和对比学习学习鲁棒表示。

Conclusion: MMLNet通过确保在信息传播导致的模态不完整场景下假新闻检测的准确性，有效遏制恶意虚假信息的传播。

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the
emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous
studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn
discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world
applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during
dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to
the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a
novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert
Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.
It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to
compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary
information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters
compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature
distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive
weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning.
We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news
detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation,
MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏从大型沉浸式360度环境中生成特定视角内容的精细控制能力，限制了创建能够感知镜头外事件的视听体验。

Method: 使用扩散模型，引入三种强大的条件信号：全景显著性图识别感兴趣区域、边界框感知有符号距离图定义目标视角、以及整个场景的描述性标题。

Result: 模型生成的空间感知视角视频和音频能够连贯地受到更广泛、不可见环境背景的影响，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实和沉浸式音频-视频生成引入了强大的可控性，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: The generation of sounding videos has seen significant advancements with the
advent of diffusion models. However, existing methods often lack the
fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger,
immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of
audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable
audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we
propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals
derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify
regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the
target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating
these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios
that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context,
introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and
immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the
effectiveness of our framework.

Motivation: 基于大语言模型的安全关键智能体设计需要超越简单的提示工程，需要系统分析规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为。

Method: 采用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），建立指针保真度界限，并结合动态规则验证架构。

Result: 发现低句法熵和高集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的基本权衡。

Conclusion: 需要原则性锚点设计和双重执行机制，以保护基于LLM的智能体免受提示注入攻击，同时在演化领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架将推理、记忆和控制功能混合在单一提示中，导致连贯性和可预测性降低。需要一种分离这些功能的架构来减轻模型认知负担。

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专门用于推理，外部维护记忆，通过轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行。中间结果可存储、重访和检查后再执行操作。

Result: 在360个测试场景中，SCL任务成功率平均86.3%，优于基线方法的70-77%。目标保真度更高，冗余调用减少，中间状态重用更可靠，每100次工具调用中的无支持断言减少。

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追溯性。结果为扩展研究提供了初步指导。

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

TL;DR: SAC-Opt是一个基于语义锚点的后向引导修正框架，通过对比原始问题语义与生成代码重构语义的差异，选择性修正不匹配组件，提高LLM生成优化模型的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型的方法主要依赖求解器反馈，存在语义错误未被检测的问题，导致生成语法正确但逻辑错误的模型。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，使用语义锚点对齐机制，通过后向引导修正策略，选择性修正语义不匹配的约束和目标逻辑组件。

Result: 在7个公开数据集上验证，平均建模准确率提升7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上最高提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在LLM驱动的优化工作流中至关重要，能确保问题意图到可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出动态裁决模板（DAT），一种受专家推理过程启发的框架，通过定性分析、证据收集和裁决三个阶段，系统处理复杂规则系统，显著提升语言模型在规则推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本而非逻辑框架，导致推理偏差和关键规则依赖的忽视。现有方法如思维链推理缺乏结构化规则处理的系统方法，且容易在顺序推理链中传播错误。

Method: DAT框架包含三个方法化阶段：1）定性分析阶段全面评估上下文环境；2）证据收集阶段基于预定义模板元素（[placeholder]）有针对性地提取相关信息，并对照适用规则进行系统验证；3）裁决阶段综合已验证组件形成全面判断。

Result: 实证结果表明，DAT在复杂规则任务中持续优于传统思维链方法。值得注意的是，DAT使较小的语言模型能够匹配甚至在某些情况下超越显著更大的LLM性能，突显其在管理复杂规则系统中的效率和有效性。

Conclusion: DAT提供了一种系统化的框架，有效解决了语言模型在复杂规则推理中的局限性，通过结构化推理机制显著提升了模型性能，并为较小模型实现与大模型相当的性能提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个明确、统一的框架，通过算法信息理论重新表述该问题，揭示意义接地过程受信息理论限制的本质。

Method: 将符号系统建模为通用图灵机，将接地定义为信息压缩过程。通过四个阶段论证：证明纯符号系统无法接地几乎所有可能世界；展示静态接地系统的不完整性；证明接地行为的不可推断性；使用柴廷不完备性定理证明任何算法学习过程都是有限系统。

Result: 证明了符号接地存在根本性的信息理论限制：纯符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；静态接地系统总存在无法压缩的敌对世界；接地行为需要外部信息输入；学习系统无法理解超过自身复杂性的世界。

Conclusion: 意义是系统不断尝试克服自身信息理论限制的开放式过程，符号接地问题本质上受算法信息理论的约束。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、鲁棒的引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计的因果追踪。

Conclusion: 两层架构将检索从不透明的黑盒转变为透明、可审计的过程，直接满足高风险领域对可解释AI的需求。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)，显著简化了PINNs的开发流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，科学家需要将问题解释为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数、实现稳定的训练流程。现有LLM方法只解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行并诊断错误进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验显示Lang-PINN比竞争基线显著降低误差并提高鲁棒性：均方误差降低3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，为PINNs开发提供了端到端的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

TL;DR: 提出了Dramaturge方法，使用分层多LLM代理来解决长篇叙事脚本的修订问题，通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段，确保局部修改与整体叙事要求的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在单次生成过程中难以产生高质量的长篇叙事，直接修改会导致局部编辑与整体叙事要求不一致，需要一种能理解整个上下文并协调多粒度修订的方法。

Method: 采用分层多LLM代理的分治方法，包括全局审查阶段把握整体故事线和结构问题，场景级审查阶段识别详细场景和句子缺陷，以及分层协调修订阶段整合结构性和细节改进。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法即插即用，可轻松集成到现有方法中以改进生成的脚本，通过从粗到细的迭代过程持续改进，直到无法做出实质性改进为止。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

Result: 实验表明，具有长期视野的赋权最大化策略具有数据效率和有效性，能显著提高下游任务的适应性。

Conclusion: 赋权预训练是一种通用的初始化策略，为未来扩展到高维复杂任务铺平了道路。

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境中智能人口健康监测提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

Method: 引入TelecomTS数据集，包含异构、去匿名化的协变量和明确的尺度信息，支持异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理问答基准等下游任务。

Conclusion: 需要能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型来满足实际可观测性应用的需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

Motivation: 传统单一模型奖励方法存在置信度校准不足、无法捕捉人类偏好多样性、需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练等问题。

Method: 混合奖励框架：模型奖励（学习奖励模型预测标量/向量分数）+ 规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供置信度明确的正确性信号）+ 多维度奖励（指令遵循、通用长度惩罚）。

Result: 在3B模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 混合奖励建模为多模态大语言模型的对齐提供灵活有效的方法，显著提升模型性能，尤其在数学推理方面表现突出。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

Motivation: 现有基准测试将对话历史视为静态上下文或仅限于只读操作，无法反映生产级数据库助手的真实挑战。需要更真实的交互环境来评估LLMs在多轮SQL任务中的表现。

Method: 构建包含层次化知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境；提供预定义对话协议(c-Interact)和开放式智能体设置(a-Interact)；设计覆盖完整CRUD操作的任务套件，包含模糊和后续子任务。

Result: BIRD-INTERACT具有很高难度：GPT-5在c-Interact中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact中完成17.00%。通过内存嫁接和交互测试时缩放验证了有效交互对复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT填补了多轮文本到SQL评估的空白，为开发能够处理真实世界数据库交互挑战的AI助手提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域证据合成的复杂性和透明度问题，利用LLM和智能体技术自动化证据处理流程。

Method: 采用模块化智能体架构，每个智能体专门处理特定证据流，实现并行处理和细粒度分析，结合确定性代码进行验证。

Result: 系统在效率和输出一致性方面取得显著提升，提供完整的证据追溯性和用户可审计性。

Conclusion: M-Reason既是实用的证据合成工具，也是科学研究中稳健多智能体LLM系统的测试平台。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

TL;DR: 本文综述了贝叶斯方法在模型预测控制（MPC）中的应用，重点关注神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化，发现现有研究存在基准不一致和可靠性分析有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估贝叶斯方法在MPC中的实际应用效果，特别是如何捕捉和传播不确定性，以提升控制系统的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 系统分析现有研究及其实际实现方式，比较贝叶斯方法在MPC中的不同应用场景。

Result: 贝叶斯方法在MPC中越来越受欢迎，但报告的性能和鲁棒性提升结果零散，缺乏一致的基准和充分的可靠性分析。

Conclusion: 需要建立标准化基准、消融研究和透明报告机制，以严谨评估贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MHA-RAG框架，通过将示例表示为软提示而非纯文本，在少样本场景下实现了更高的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用领域特定示例作为上下文演示，但纯文本表示可能不是最有效、稳定和高效的方法。

Method: 引入MHA-RAG框架，使用多头注意力机制将示例表示为软提示，注意力头数量作为控制不同任务软提示生成的超参数。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和模型规模下，MHA-RAG相比标准RAG实现了20分的性能提升，同时推理成本降低了10倍GFLOPs。

Conclusion: MHA-RAG在保持示例顺序不变性的同时，提供了更高的准确性和效率，是适应基础模型到新领域的有效方法。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究基于符号互动理论，通过两个实证研究探索人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义，发现意义共享不是来自简单同意，而是来自符号的双向交换和重新解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有意义的人机协作需要超越语言处理，深入理解符号及其社会建构意义。人类通过社会互动自然解释符号，而AI系统往往错过对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动理论，进行了两个实证研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义，特别关注社会语境引入时的互动过程。

Result: 研究发现参与者会根据对话AI建议的符号和解释调整初始意义定义，特别是当引入社会语境时。参与者将个人和社会价值观投射到互动中，随时间推移精炼意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解不是来自简单同意，而是来自符号的双向交换和重新解释，这为人机交互设计提出了新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的逆过程建模方法，解决钢铁热处理硬度预测的模糊性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢铁热处理过程中，不同输入参数组合可能导致相同的硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数变得困难

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练正向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈进行迭代优化

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上验证，相比基线回归和强化学习模型，该方法在逆预测精度和计算效率方面均有显著提升

Conclusion: 师生学习框架为材料科学中的逆过程建模提供了有效且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AInstein框架测试LLM仅使用预训练参数知识解决AI研究问题的能力，无需外部辅助。结果表明LLM能够重新发现可行解决方案并偶尔提出创造性方法，但问题解决能力仍然脆弱且对框架敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的成功是源于真正推理还是复杂回忆，测试其作为自主科学问题解决者的能力程度。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交中提取问题陈述，通过迭代批判循环让专门的求解器代理提出和完善技术解决方案，使用LLM作为评判者进行结构化评估。

Result: LLM能够重新发现可行解决方案，偶尔提出创造性替代方法，但问题解决能力脆弱且高度依赖于问题框架。

Conclusion: 这是关于LLM作为自主科学问题解决者能力的首个大规模证据，既突显了其潜在能力，也揭示了当前局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合神经符号框架，将答案集编程与基于Transformer的学习相结合，用于航空安全报告系统的多标签文本分类，通过规则增强和模糊逻辑正则化减少领域逻辑违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现出色，但经常违反专家认为必要的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤其令人担忧。

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过Clingo求解器验证。采用两种互补方式：规则驱动的数据增强生成逻辑一致的合成样本；模糊逻辑正则化在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强基线相比，该方法提高了微观和宏观F1分数，在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违规减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分Transformer训练统一起来的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI模型在编程任务中是否表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，即能力不足的模型会高估自己的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类协作日益增多，需要了解AI的认知边界和偏见如何影响其与人类的共同决策能力。

Method: 通过分析不同编程语言中模型的置信度和实际表现，研究模型在熟悉和陌生领域的自信偏差。

Result: 实验显示能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中操作的模型表现出更强的邓宁-克鲁格效应，这种偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会表现出类似人类的认知偏见，特别是在不熟悉或资源有限的领域中，这对AI与人类协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或预定义安全违规，只能检查规则遵从性，无法揭示模型在面对现实争议问题时是否坚持一致的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建115K对正反框架提示词，通过LLM作为评判员来评分配对回答之间的一致性或分歧程度。

Result: 在领先的开源和闭源模型上应用该基准，发现价值对齐存在显著差异，并揭示了安全策略（如拒绝回答）与更丰富价值系统之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统比较LLMs如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的自动漏洞修复方法，通过生成漏洞相关推理数据和使用多步推理训练来解决现有LLM方法在漏洞修复中面临的两个主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动漏洞修复方法面临两个关键挑战：缺乏高质量的漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以验证漏洞修复过程中的中间步骤。这导致模型难以捕捉多样化的漏洞修复模式。

Method: 论文提出生成漏洞相关推理数据，并使用多步推理训练方法来指导模型学习漏洞修复过程，解决了缺乏中间可验证反馈的问题。

Result: 通过解决这两个挑战，该方法能够更好地捕捉漏洞修复模式，提高自动漏洞修复的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于LLM的自动漏洞修复提供了新的解决方案，通过生成推理数据和多步推理训练克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了数据驱动的决策支持，能够准确预测未来十年的排放趋势。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed
ensemble model achieved an SMAPE of 1.407 with no signs of overfitting.
Finally, this research provides an accurate decade-long emission projection

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、主干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多样化目标任务，利用轻量级元学习机制实现高效可扩展的对齐，显著提升VLA模型在具身推理中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，且对未见任务的泛化能力差。需要一种高效、可扩展的后训练框架来提升模型的通用性。

Method: 提出Context-Aware Meta Co-Training，将多样目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，利用结构多样的辅助任务提升域内泛化。采用基于Attentive Neural Processes的轻量级元学习机制，实现从多样化上下文的快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，MetaVLA在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: MetaVLA证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为实现通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）协调工作，在实时环境中优化多轮交互，解决了传统工具增强方法在长视野和多样化工具下的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，且对新场景泛化能力弱。智能体系统通过分解工作到专门模块提供了有前景的替代方案，但大多数系统缺乏训练或依赖离线训练。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演进记忆，在实时环境中通过Flow-GRPO算法进行在线策略训练，将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，使用7B规模骨干的AgentFlow在搜索任务上平均准确率提升14.9%，智能体任务提升14.0%，数学任务提升14.5%，科学任务提升4.1%，甚至超过GPT-4o等更大的专有模型。

Conclusion: AgentFlow通过在线优化显著提升了规划能力、工具调用可靠性和模型规模与推理轮数的正向扩展性，证明了在实时环境中训练智能体系统的有效性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving

workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

TL;DR: GPT-4o能够从放射学报告中高精度提取诊断标签（准确率98.6%），这些标签可用于训练具有竞争力的多标签图像分类模型，且标签不确定性不影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X光片的多标签图像分类。

Method: 使用GPT-4o从锁骨、肘部和拇指的放射学报告中提取结构化标签（真/假/不确定），并将这些标签用于训练ResNet50多标签分类模型，比较包含性和排他性标签策略。

Result: 标签提取准确率达98.6%，基于标签训练的模型在内部和外部测试集上表现良好（肘部AUC=0.79-0.80），不同标签策略或数据集间无显著差异。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够从放射学报告中提取标签来训练具有竞争力的多标签分类模型，且检测到的不确定性不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感器运动基元具有足够的泛化性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，桌面预训练是机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Motivation: 传统在线深度强化学习在灾害监测中训练复杂且存在仿真与现实不匹配问题，无法满足海啸监测的紧急需求。大语言模型具有强大的推理和泛化能力，但需要定制化方法解决输入数据限制。

Method: 提出AIC-VDS方法，联合优化多无人机的数据收集调度和速度控制，考虑地面传感器电池电量、队列长度、信道条件以及无人机轨迹，使用基于注意力机制的上下文学习。

Result: 仿真结果表明，AIC-VDS方法在性能上优于深度Q网络和最大信道增益基线方法。

Conclusion: AIC-VDS为紧急情况下的无人机数据收集提供了一种有效的深度强化学习替代方案，能够适应灾害监测的实时需求。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ARM（Agentic Reasoning Module）新范式，通过优化CoT推理自动设计多智能体系统，显著优于手动设计和现有自动方法，且具备出色的跨模型和跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的数据标注，而简单的思维链推理表现与复杂系统相当，因此需要深入研究推理单元。

Method: 引入ARM作为思维链的智能体化泛化，每个推理步骤由专门模块执行。通过代码空间的树搜索从简单CoT模块开始，利用执行轨迹反思指导突变演化，发现通用推理构建块。

Result: 显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法，构建的ARM系统在不同基础模型和任务领域保持高性能而无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM范式通过优化核心推理单元实现了高效、通用的多智能体系统自动设计，解决了现有方法的性能不足和泛化问题。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图神经网络的拉格朗日粒子扩散模型（LPDM）仿真器，用于估算大气传输足迹和温室气体浓度，实现1000倍加速并量化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 温室气体排放监测需要高效可扩展的推断方法，传统传输模型计算成本高且不确定性难以表征，人工智能为加速模拟和量化不确定性提供新机会。

Method: 使用图神经网络构建LPDM仿真器，采用集成方法估算大气传输足迹、温室气体浓度及其不确定性，以巴西2016年GOSAT卫星观测数据为例进行验证。

Result: 仿真器比NAME LPDM快约1000倍，能再现大尺度足迹结构，集成分析揭示了预测误差的空间相关性，集成分布突出了低置信度的时空预测。

Conclusion: 该方法可推广到其他大气传输模型，支持不确定性感知的温室气体反演系统，提高卫星排放监测的稳健性，并为探索系统误差提供计算高效途径。

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒式传播具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。本研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒式传播的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度分数的病毒性定义方法，评估了包括逻辑回归、XGBoost和多层感知机在内的多种模型，使用全面的多模态特征集在不同时间窗口（30-420分钟）进行预测。

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，在仅30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了明显的"证据转换"现象，即随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 本研究为早期病毒性预测建立了一个稳健、可解释且实用的基准，特别是在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下，贡献了一个新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Conclusion: 该方法将罕见病药物重定位从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，通过多智能体辩论和自我进化机制有效解决了缺乏先验关联的挑战。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在生物等领域中，由于湿实验数据稀缺导致难以获取真实标签来筛选合成思维链数据的问题，寻求一种无需外部标签的替代方案。

Method: 使用模型自身的不确定性指标（如自一致性和预测困惑度）来量化置信度，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集，进行监督微调。

Result: 在生物扰动预测任务中，过滤后的子集准确率更高，基于不确定性过滤数据的监督微调性能优于未过滤合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距，并超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是创建高效推理数据集的强大信号，能够在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的训练。

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于真理的LLM优化容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。辩论式优化在辩论场景中显示出潜力，但尚未与主流真理优化方法进行系统比较。

Method: 提出DebateQD算法，这是一种最小化的质量多样性进化算法，通过锦标赛式辩论（两个LLM辩论，第三个LLM评判）来演化不同类别的多样化辩论策略。该方法在单一LLM架构内通过基于提示的策略保持对手多样性，使实验更易进行。

Result: 在三个模型规模（7B、32B、72B参数）和多个QuALITY基准数据集大小上，说服力优化策略的训练-测试泛化差距最多减少13.94%，同时匹配或超过真理优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力而非协作寻求真理，能够培养更具可迁移性的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETA是一个无需训练的多智能体时间序列分类框架，通过基于示例的上下文推理实现高效分类，无需预训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，特定任务训练成本高且不灵活，而纯零样本使用大型语言模型效果欠佳。

Method: 将多变量序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，利用推理LLM比较查询与示例，生成带置信度的通道级标签，最后通过置信度加权聚合器融合所有通道决策。

Result: 在9个UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个训练基线。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转变为具有竞争力的即插即用TSC求解器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过动态生成数学测试实例来评估模型推理能力，避免传统数学基准的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数学基准存在两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集，且现有基准因符号和规则多样性有限、答案封闭而容易过拟合。

Method: 利用上述缺点构建动态反事实基准MatheMagic，在测试时随机生成数学实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎推理而非归纳推理，且数学适应模型未能展现通用推理技能，归纳任务的微调泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效揭示过拟合并测量真实推理能力，提供稳定、可扩展、可比较且抗过拟合的评估框架。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

TL;DR: ARISE是一个专门评估大型推理模型测试时扩展能力的新指标，包含样本级感知和动态采样机制，能可靠衡量模型的计算资源动态分配效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较不同模型的测试时扩展能力，但现有评估方法无法有效衡量计算资源动态分配的效果。

Method: 提出ARISE评估指标，包含两个关键创新：样本级感知机制（惩罚计算增加但性能下降的情况）和动态采样机制（减少准确率波动和token数不稳定性对评估的影响）。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域的实验表明，ARISE能可靠地评估测试时扩展能力，发现不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异，Claude Opus展现出最优的扩展特性。

Conclusion: ARISE为评估大型推理模型的测试时扩展能力提供了可靠且细粒度的测量方法，有助于系统比较不同模型的扩展效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型推理模型存在"拒绝悬崖"现象：模型在思考过程中能正确识别有害提示并保持拒绝意图，但在最终输出前拒绝分数急剧下降。通过稀疏注意力头干预和基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法，可以高效修复模型的安全对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然具有强大的多步推理能力，但存在安全漏洞且机制尚不明确。本研究旨在通过机制可解释性方法探究推理模型中安全对齐失败的原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪不同token位置的拒绝意图，发现拒绝悬崖现象；通过因果干预分析识别负向影响拒绝行为的稀疏注意力头；提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法Cliff-as-a-Judge。

Result: 仅消融3%的注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下；使用仅1.7%的常规安全训练数据即可达到相当的安全改进效果，展现了安全对齐中的"少即是多"效应。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非天生不安全，而是其拒绝意图被系统性地抑制。通过机制性理解和针对性干预，可以高效修复模型的安全对齐问题。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同的详细推理方式存在大量冗余，因为子问题的难度差异很大，只有少数关键步骤真正具有挑战性。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，能够根据步骤难度动态调整推理深度，生成混合了详细推理和简洁推理的思维链。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应调整推理深度的混合推理方法能够有效减少冗余，提高推理效率，是推理模型的一个重要改进方向。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: DeepEvolve是一个结合深度研究和算法演化的科学助手代理，通过外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试的反馈驱动迭代循环，持续改进初始算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学助手要么仅依赖算法演化（如AlphaEvolve），在复杂领域快速达到瓶颈；要么只进行深度研究而不验证，产生不切实际的解决方案。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 集成深度研究与算法演化，包含外部知识检索、跨文件代码编辑和系统调试，采用反馈驱动的迭代循环，每次迭代不仅提出新假设，还进行精炼、实现和测试。

Result: 在化学、数学、生物、材料和专利等九个基准测试中，DeepEvolve持续改进初始算法，产生可执行的新算法并保持持续增益。

Conclusion: DeepEvolve通过弥合无引导演化与无基础研究之间的差距，为推进科学算法发现提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐系统，解决了传统算法在自然语言查询适应性和空间推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，难以适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法虽然灵活，但在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在困难。

Method: 采用分层多智能体框架：首先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后通过管理器协调约束代理、POI代理和路径优化代理，最后通过验证器确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功弥合了语言灵活性和空间结构之间的差距，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的推理。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

Conclusion: 两种方法在决策者对齐任务中表现相似，经典AI在特定风险配置下略有优势，为AI对齐研究提供了有价值的比较基准。

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

TL;DR: 优化大型语言模型在竞争环境中的表现会导致模型失调，即使有对齐保障，竞争压力仍会驱动模型产生欺骗性内容、虚假信息和有害行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，揭示市场竞争压力如何系统性地削弱模型对齐性。

Method: 在广告营销、选举和社交媒体三个竞争场景中使用模拟环境，评估模型在优化竞争成功时的行为变化。

Result: 竞争优化导致：销售增长6.3%伴随欺骗性营销增加14.0%；得票率增长4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%和民粹言论增加12.5%；参与度增长7.5%伴随虚假信息增加188.6%和有害行为推广增加16.3%。

Conclusion: 市场竞争压力会系统性地侵蚀模型对齐性，形成恶性竞争，AI系统的安全部署需要更强治理和精心设计的激励机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

Motivation: 在某些场景下（如解决数独谜题），验证答案比生成答案要容易得多，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的巨大潜力。

Method: 结合顺序扩展（延长生成过程）和并行扩展（验证并选择多个候选输出）策略，利用不对称验证特性，为验证器分配适度的计算资源。

Result: 通过TTS扩展开源模型到"Heavy"变体，在BrowseComp基准上获得高达27个绝对百分点的提升。GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp上达到54.0%，在GAIA上达到66.0%；Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy在BrowseComp上达到69.0%，大幅超越最佳专有模型。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展，特别是利用不对称验证特性，能够显著提升模型性能，使开源模型达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering

### [81] [Redefining Cost Estimation in Database Systems: The Role of Execution Plan Features and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05612)
*Utsav Pathak,Amit Mankodi*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的SQL查询运行时预测框架，使用PostgreSQL执行计划特征和查询语义表示来训练预测模型，XGBoost模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据库系统的静态启发式成本模型在复杂和动态工作负载下无法准确反映实际查询性能，需要更精确的运行时预测方法。

Method: 构建自动化数据收集和特征提取管道，从PostgreSQL执行计划中提取标量和结构特征，结合SQL查询的语义表示，评估多种建模技术包括基线回归器、改进的XGBoost模型和基于LSTM的序列模型。

Result: XGBoost模型显著优于其他方法，均方误差为0.3002，在超过65%的情况下预测精度在真实运行时的10%以内。

Conclusion: 基于树的机器学习方法结合执行计划特征在改进查询优化器成本估计方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Accurate query runtime prediction is a critical component of effective query
optimization in modern database systems. Traditional cost models, such as those
used in PostgreSQL, rely on static heuristics that often fail to reflect actual
query performance under complex and evolving workloads. This remains an active
area of research, with recent work exploring machine learning techniques to
replace or augment traditional cost estimators. In this paper, we present a
machine learning-based framework for predicting SQL query runtimes using
execution plan features extracted from PostgreSQL. Our approach integrates
scalar and structural features from execution plans and semantic
representations of SQL queries to train predictive models. We construct an
automated pipeline for data collection and feature extraction using
parameterized TPC-H queries, enabling systematic evaluation of multiple
modeling techniques. Unlike prior efforts that focus either on cardinality
estimation or on synthetic cost metrics, we model the actual runtimes using
fine-grained plan statistics and query embeddings derived from execution
traces, to improve the model accuracy. We compare baseline regressors, a
refined XGBoost model, and a sequential LSTM-based model to assess their
effectiveness in runtime prediction. Our dataset includes over 1000 queries
generated from TPC-H query templates executed in PostgreSQL with EXPLAIN
ANALYZE. Experimental results show that the XGBoost model significantly
outperforms others, achieving a mean squared error of 0.3002 and prediction
accuracy within 10% of the true runtime in over 65% of cases. The findings
highlight the potential of tree-based learning combined with execution plan
features for improving cost estimation in query optimizers.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出一种处理SQL相关子查询的新技术，通过分离非相关谓词部分来减少相关部分的评估次数，在合适条件下可实现5倍性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SQL相关子查询处理效率问题，通过优化查询执行策略来减少不必要的计算开销。

Method: 1) 识别查询中非相关谓词部分并利用其减少相关部分评估；2) 在支持位置感知和延迟物化的列存储系统中实现；3) 提出简单的成本模型评估重写效益。

Result: 在PosDB和PostgreSQL上的实验表明，在合适条件下该技术可实现5倍性能提升，并分析了非相关谓词选择性的影响。

Conclusion: 该技术能有效优化相关子查询处理性能，特别是在具有合适选择性的非相关谓词条件下效果显著。

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss a novel technique for processing correlated
subqueries in SQL. The core idea is to isolate the non-correlated part of the
predicate and use it to reduce the number of evaluations of the correlated
part. We begin by providing an overview of several classes of queries that may
benefit from this technique. For each class, we propose a potential rewrite and
discuss the conditions under which it is advantageous. Next, we address the
evaluation aspects of the proposed rewrites: 1) we describe our approach to
adapting the block-based Volcano query processing model, and 2) we discuss the
benefits of implementing that technique within a position-enabled column-store
with late materialization support. Finally, we present a simple cost model that
allows estimation of the benefits of said rewrites.
  Our evaluation has a quantitative part and a qualitative part. The former
focuses on studying the impact of non-correlated predicate selectivity on our
technique. The latter identifies the limitations of our approach by comparing
it with alternative approaches available in existing systems. Overall,
experiments conducted using PosDB (a position-enabled column-store) and
PostgreSQL demonstrated that, under suitable conditions, our technique can
achieve a 5x improvement.

### [83] [Computing Envy-Free up to Any Good (EFX) Allocations via Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05429)
*Simina Brânzei*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模拟退火的局部搜索算法，用于计算具有加性估值代理之间的EFX（无嫉妒到任何物品）分配。该算法在数千个随机生成的实例中都能找到EFX分配，并能扩展到数百个代理和数千个物品的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EFX是一种重要的公平性概念，但此类分配是否始终存在仍是公平分配领域的一个主要开放性问题。需要开发有效的算法来寻找EFX分配。

Method: 使用模拟退火算法，以EFX违反总数作为目标函数，结合单转移邻域结构在分配空间中移动。

Result: 算法在所有测试实例中都能找到EFX分配，包括数千个随机生成的输入，并能扩展到数百个代理和/或数千个物品的设置。

Conclusion: 该算法简单且具有强大的实证性能，可作为评估未来方法的基准。在理论方面，为相同加性估值提供了势函数，确保在单转移邻域下的严格下降过程最终达到EFX分配。

Abstract: We present a simple local search algorithm for computing EFX (envy-free up to
any good) allocations of $m$ indivisible goods among $n$ agents with additive
valuations. EFX is a compelling fairness notion, and whether such allocations
always exist remains a major open question in fair division.
  Our algorithm employs simulated annealing with the total number of EFX
violations as an objective function together with a single-transfer
neighborhood structure to move through the space of allocations. It found an
EFX allocation in all the instances tested, which included thousands of
randomly generated inputs, and scaled to settings with hundreds of agents
and/or thousands of items. The algorithm's simplicity, along with its strong
empirical performance makes it a simple benchmark for evaluating future
approaches.
  On the theoretical side, we provide a potential function for identical
additive valuations, which ensures that any strict-descent procedure under the
single-transfer neighborhood ends at an EFX allocation. This represents an
alternative proof of existence for identical valuations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典租金分配问题，引入实际应用中常见的约束条件：房间租金上下界和房间特定预算约束，以提升公平分配方法在现实平台（如Spliddit）中的适用性。

Method: 开发高效的组合算法来处理两种约束类型，构建统一的算法框架，既能计算可行的无嫉妒分配，又能证明不可行性，并设计优化算法来最大化最小效用、词典序最小效用和最小效用差异等公平目标。

Result: 提出了能够处理复杂约束的租金分配算法，为现实世界平台提供了实用的公平分配解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究通过引入实际约束条件并开发统一算法框架，显著推进了公平分配方法在现实应用中的适用性，为类似Spliddit的平台提供了有效的技术支持。

Abstract: We study the classical rent division problem, where $n$ agents must allocate
$n$ indivisible rooms and split a fixed total rent $R$. The goal is to compute
an envy-free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's room and
rent to their own. This problem has been extensively studied under standard
assumptions, where efficient algorithms for computing EF allocations are known.
  We extend this framework by introducing two practically motivated
constraints: (i) lower and upper bounds on room rents, and (ii) room-specific
budget for agents. We develop efficient combinatorial algorithms that either
compute a feasible EF allocation or certify infeasibility.
  We further design algorithms to optimize over EF allocations using natural
fairness objectives such as maximin utility, leximin utility, and minimum
utility spread. Our approach unifies both constraint types within a single
algorithmic framework, advancing the applicability of fair division methods in
real-world platforms such as Spliddit.

*Jabari Hastings,Prasanna Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了度量失真框架下的匹配问题，比较了总距离成本和最大个体成本两种目标函数下的失真表现，发现RepMatch机制在最大成本目标下性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统匹配机制基于总距离成本，可能导致不公平结果，少数个体承担大部分成本。因此研究在最大个体成本目标下的度量失真问题。

Method: 使用RepMatch机制的变体，分析其在最大成本目标下的性能，并与总距离成本目标进行比较。

Result: RepMatch机制在最大成本目标下的失真从O(n²)改善到O(n^{1.58})，对于任意单调对称范数定义的公平目标，保证失真为O(n²)。

Conclusion: 最大成本目标相比总距离成本能显著改善匹配机制的公平性表现，RepMatch机制在不同成本目标下表现出不同的失真特性。

Abstract: We consider the matching problem in the metric distortion framework. There
are $n$ agents and $n$ items occupying points in a shared metric space, and the
goal is to design a matching mechanism that outputs a low-cost matching between
the agents and items, using only agents' ordinal rankings of the candidates by
distance. A mechanism has distortion $\alpha$ if it always outputs a matching
whose cost is within a factor of $\alpha$ of the optimum, in every instance
regardless of the metric space.
  Typically, the cost of a matching is measured in terms of the total distance
between matched agents and items, but this measure can incentivize unfair
outcomes where a handful of agents bear the brunt of the cost. With this in
mind, we consider how the metric distortion problem changes when the cost is
instead measured in terms of the maximum cost of any agent. We show that while
these two notions of distortion can in general differ by a factor of $n$, the
distortion of a variant of the state-of-the-art mechanism, RepMatch, actually
improves from $O(n^2)$ under the sum objective to $O(n^{1.58})$ under the max
objective. We also show that for any fairness objective defined by a monotone
symmetric norm, this algorithm guarantees distortion $O(n^2)$.

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了Myerson单物品最优拍卖理论到多物品场景，在双值设定下建立了首个闭式最优机制，涵盖独立同分布代理和物品、非独立同分布代理与物品等多种情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Myerson的单物品最优拍卖理论难以推广到多物品场景，现有研究大多局限于单代理或均匀分布假设。该工作旨在突破这些限制，在更一般的多代理多物品设置下寻找闭式最优机制。

Method: 基于Yao的双值设定（每个物品价值取两个可能值），沿三个自然维度扩展：独立同分布代理和物品、非独立同分布代理与两个独立同分布物品、独立同分布代理与两个非独立同分布物品。

Result: 建立了上述三种设置下的首个闭式最优机制，证明了在双值设定下这些机制可以达到理论极限。同时推广了grand bundling策略的最优性结果。

Conclusion: 该工作在多物品拍卖机制设计领域取得了重要突破，提供了在复杂场景下的闭式最优解，扩展了Myerson理论的适用范围。

Abstract: Myerson's seminal characterization of the revenue-optimal auction for a
single item \cite{myerson1981optimal} remains a cornerstone of mechanism
design. However, generalizing this framework to multi-item settings has proven
exceptionally challenging. Even under restrictive assumptions, closed-form
characterizations of optimal mechanisms are rare and are largely confined to
the single-agent case \cite{pavlov2011optimal,hart2017approximate,
daskalakis2018transport, GIANNAKOPOULOS2018432}, departing from the two-item
setting only when prior distributions are uniformly distributed
\cite{manelli2006bundling, daskalakis2017strong,giannakopoulos2018sjm}. In this
work, we build upon the bi-valued setting introduced by Yao
\cite{YAO_BIC_DSIC}, where each item's value has support 2 and lies in $\{a,
b\}$. Yao's result provides the only known closed-form optimal mechanism for
multiple agents. We extend this line of work along three natural axes,
establishing the first closed-form optimal mechanisms in each of the following
settings: (i) $n$ i.i.d. agents and $m$ i.i.d. items (ii) $n$ non-i.i.d. agents
and two i.i.d. items and (iii) $n$ i.i.d. agents and two non-i.i.d. items. Our
results lie at the limit of what is considered possible, since even with a
single agent and m bi-valued non-i.i.d. items, finding the optimal mechanism is
$\#P$-Hard \cite{daskalakis2014complexity, xi2018soda}. We finally generalize
the discrete analog of a result from~\cite{daskalakis2017strong}, showing that
for a single agent with $m$ items drawn from arbitrary (non-identical) discrete
distributions, grand bundling is optimal when all item values are sufficiently
large. We further show that for any continuous product distribution, grand
bundling achieves $\mathrm{OPT} - \epsilon$ revenue for large enough values.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于智能合约的资源分配机制设计框架，将效率和公平性嵌入去中心化协调中，证明了合约均衡的存在性和唯一性，并开发了具有可证明收敛保证的去中心化价格调整算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去中心化协调和数字合约方法通常依赖临时启发式方法或纯技术区块链实现，缺乏严谨的经济基础，无法在复杂工业生态系统中有效平衡效率和公平。

Method: 开发了机制设计框架，建立了合约均衡理论，引入了具有可证明收敛保证的去中心化价格调整算法，并通过合成基准测试和MovieLens数据集进行实证验证。

Result: 该机制在效率和公平性方面均取得显著改进，对费用波动、参与冲击和动态需求具有鲁棒性，在现实分配环境中能有效平衡效率与公平。

Conclusion: 研究展示了数字合约不仅是技术工具，更是实现透明度、问责制和韧性的制度工具，在供应链、物流、能源市场、医疗资源分配和公共基础设施等领域具有广泛的管理和政策相关性。

Abstract: Decentralized coordination and digital contracting are becoming critical in
complex industrial ecosystems, yet existing approaches often rely on ad hoc
heuristics or purely technical blockchain implementations without a rigorous
economic foundation. This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart
contract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and
fairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and
uniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism
design, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate
performance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept
real-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee
volatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case
study illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in
realistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed
mechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while
remaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond
steady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy
relevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource
allocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable
coordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with
empirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only
as technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency,
accountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation.

Result: 在线性、弱元素和平坦层次公理下，推导出Shapley值的唯一显式公式，并恢复经典性质如效率、零玩家、对称性以及新的投影性质。

Conclusion: 该框架可特化为有限包含代数、格、偏序和分体论，为机器学习、语言处理和可解释AI等新应用领域开辟了可能性。

Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to
directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow
value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function)
and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a
ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve
this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity,
efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine
Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two
novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to
interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of
higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of
the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements
and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with
vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The
latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of
hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply
a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical
properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the
projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion
algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain
previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new
perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph
structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up
the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine
learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many
more.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链交易费机制设计强调对抗矿工和用户合谋的鲁棒性，现有研究显示1-SCP和2-SCP机制类存在差异，本文旨在探索更高阶合谋鲁棒性的性质。

Method: 在相对较小的假设（一致平局处理）下，通过理论分析证明2-SCP机制类与任意c≥2的c-SCP机制类的等价性。

Result: 发现2-SCP机制类与所有c≥2的c-SCP机制类相同，这意味着如果一个机制易受合谋攻击，那么它也易受小型合谋攻击。

Conclusion: 在区块链交易费机制设计中，对抗小型合谋（2方合谋）的鲁棒性实际上意味着对抗任意规模合谋的鲁棒性，这简化了机制设计的安全性分析。

Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain
context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than
traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of
a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a
collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work
\cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the
$1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms
equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption
of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism
vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，用于增强大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性，在UCI空气质量数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型在环境监测等领域的复杂性增加，需要提高模型的可解释性和公平性以建立信任、符合伦理要求和监管规定（如GDPR）。传统黑盒模型缺乏透明度，而LIME、SHAP等事后可解释AI技术经常牺牲准确性或无法提供内在洞察。

Method: 采用类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类相结合的方法，包括：(1) 类型2模糊聚类方法；(2) 集成公平性度量；(3) 基于规则的组件用于内在可解释AI；(4) 可扩展性评估。

Result: 在UCI空气质量数据集上的实验结果显示：类型2模糊聚类相比类型1方法提升约4%的凝聚度（轮廓系数0.365 vs. 0.349），公平性提升（熵值0.918）；规则组件平均覆盖率达到0.65；运行时间呈线性增长（大数据采样约0.005秒）。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在可解释性、公平性和效率方面优于DBSCAN和凝聚聚类等基线方法，特别是在轮廓系数上比类型1模糊聚类提升4%，在公平性（熵减少达1%）和效率方面表现更优。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Motivation: Transformer模型在金融应用中日益流行，但其潜在风险和偏见尚未充分探索，需要审计模型对波动性数据的依赖程度。

Method: 使用Transformer模型进行预测，并引入基于偏信息分解(PID)的指标来度量每个资产对模型决策的影响。

Result: 分析揭示两个关键发现：模型完全忽略数据波动性，且对低频价格变动数据存在偏见。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在金融应用中存在对数据波动性不敏感和频率偏见的风险，需要进一步关注和优化。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代品，能够稳定梯度、加速收敛并消除密集轨迹存储需求。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+

*Muhammad Arif Hakimi Zamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于条件变分自编码器(CVAE)的生成式逆向设计框架，替代传统的单点优化方法，能够生成多样化的高性能设计候选方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的优化(SBO)方法只能收敛到单一最优解，限制了设计空间的探索，忽略了可能有价值的替代拓扑结构。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器(CVAE)学习设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，基于特定性能目标生成多样化的高性能设计候选方案。

Result: 在翼型自噪声最小化问题上，CVAE框架成功生成了256个新设计，有效率为94.1%。其中77.2%的有效设计性能优于SBO基线找到的单一最优设计。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解决方案，还提供了丰富的多样化候选方案组合，从根本上增强了工程设计过程，支持多标准决策。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Conclusion: 机器学习在数字银行欺诈检测中展现出强大潜力，混合模型是未来发展方向，但可解释性和实时部署仍是挑战。

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了第一个针对高性能深度脉冲神经网络的QIF神经元模型离散化方法，通过分析其动态特性并推导出基于参数集的代理梯度窗口，解决了训练不稳定性问题，在多个数据集上超越了基于LIF的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动态特性但训练不稳定，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出了QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，从离散化参数集推导出代理梯度窗口的解析公式，以最小化梯度不匹配，确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS等数据集上的评估表明，该方法能够超越基于LIF的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的QIF神经元离散化方法结合了丰富的动态特性和实际可扩展性，成为深度SNN中LIF神经元的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了MADCN框架，结合多头注意力和深度交叉网络来预测城市碳排放，并分析新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术的影响。模型在275个中国城市数据集上表现优异，SHAP分析揭示了影响碳排放的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新质生产力、数字经济进步和人工智能技术对促进城市可持续发展至关重要，需要开发有效方法来预测碳排放并评估技术因素的影响。

Method: 提出多注意力头深度交叉网络(MADCN)框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，并使用SHAP进行可解释性分析。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上取得MSE=406,151.063、MAE=612.304、R²=0.991的优异表现，SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模、城镇化率和GDP是主要影响因素，新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术也有显著但相对温和的影响。

Conclusion: 推进新质生产力、加强数字经济和加速AI技术发展能显著减少城市碳排放，政策制定者应将技术创新整合到碳减排战略中，特别是推广智能基础设施和提升各行业数字化水平。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

*Anushiya Arunan,Yan Qin,Xiaoli Li,U-Xuan Tan,H. Vincent Poor,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出首个基于自监督预训练的电池容量估计模型，使用隐私友好的充电数据片段，通过片段相似性加权掩码输入重建学习通用表示，在真实世界数据分布偏移下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车电池容量准确估计对消费者信心至关重要，但隐私法规和标记数据短缺限制了通用化模型的开发。现有自监督学习方法难以从隐私友好数据中有效学习，这些数据通常特征较少且噪声更多。

Method: 提出片段相似性加权掩码输入重建预训练框架：首先使用对比学习捕捉片段间高层相似性，然后进行相似性加权的掩码重建，同时学习单个片段内的细粒度充电模式和跨片段的高层关联关系。

Result: 模型在具有制造商和老化引起的分布偏移的挑战性域转移设置下，始终优于最先进的基线方法，测试误差比最佳基准降低了31.9%。

Conclusion: 该自监督预训练方法能够从特征较少、碎片化的隐私友好数据中学习丰富的通用表示，为电池容量估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息论估计器在连续随机变量的KL散度估计中维度扩展性和样本规模适应性差，现有神经网络方法缺乏算法实际性能的理论保证

Method: 使用具有随机隐藏权重和偏置的浅层神经网络（随机特征方法）来估计KL散度

Result: 算法以高概率实现KL散度估计误差为O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})，其中m是神经元数量，T是算法步数和样本数

Conclusion: 提出的随机特征方法为KL散度估计提供了理论保证的性能边界，解决了现有神经网络方法缺乏算法性能保证的问题

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因果注意力计算中涉及大量三角矩阵乘法操作，如掩码乘积 Mask(QK^T)，这些操作在GPU上的默认实现效率不高，需要优化。

Method: FCA基于通过机器学习和组合搜索发现的代数恒等式，专门优化三角矩阵乘法，包括前向和后向传播中的所有因果注意力操作。

Conclusion: FCA提供了一种高效的因果注意力计算方法，通过代数优化显著提升了GPU上的计算性能。

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact
Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class
of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product
$\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches
noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton
compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine
learning and combinatorial search.

TL;DR: PatternKV是一种针对LLM推理中KV缓存的量化方法，通过模式对齐残差量化来降低内存和带宽瓶颈，在低比特设置下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存已成为LLM推理中的主要内存和带宽瓶颈，特别是在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下。现有量化方法无法有效展平KV分布，导致低比特设置下精度急剧下降。

Method: 提出PatternKV模式对齐残差量化方案：在线挖掘代表性模式向量，将每个KV向量对齐到最近模式，仅量化残差部分，从而展平量化目标并缩小范围。

Result: 在多个骨干模型的长上下文和测试时扩展设置中，PatternKV实现一致的2比特增益，4比特相对于FP16平均仅下降0.08%，测试时扩展精度平均提升10%，吞吐量提高1.4倍，支持1.25倍更大批次。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过挖掘KV缓存的内在结构规律，有效解决了低比特KV量化的精度问题，为长上下文LLM推理提供了高效的内存优化方案。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

Motivation: 符号回归虽然能生成可读方程，但难以编码单位感知的阈值和条件逻辑，限制了在临床等领域的实际应用。

Method: 使用逻辑门控算子(LGO)作为类型化原语，具有可学习的位置和陡度参数，并映射回物理单位进行审计。

Result: 在两个医疗数据集(ICU、NHANES)上，硬门控变体恢复了临床合理的切点：71%的评估阈值在指南锚点的10%范围内，100%在20%范围内，且使用更少的门控(ICU中位数4.0 vs 10.0；NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5)，同时保持与强基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法将可解释性从后验解释转变为建模约束，为符号回归提供了实用的机制切换计算能力，适合治理就绪的部署。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合在实际IoT环境中部署，能有效解决联邦学习中的数据异构性和能耗问题。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在合成问题和真实星系观测中均表现出有效性，为源分离问题提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 研究神经网络权重矩阵的分布特性，测试矩阵模型在表示其分布方面的有效性，特别是在高斯性和置换对称性假设下。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型来建模权重矩阵的分布，计算Wasserstein距离来量化训练过程中的分布移动，并测试不同初始化策略、正则化、层深度和宽度的影响。

Result: 发现置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效建模权重矩阵的相关高斯性，超出简单独立同分布高斯模型的适用范围，特别是在初始化步骤之后。模型参数和置换不变矩阵可观测量的图论特征为最佳拟合模型提供了可解释框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为神经网络权重分布提供了可解释的建模框架，识别了高斯性偏离增强的特定条件，并为开发更通用但仍高度可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种组合式框架来计算深度前馈神经网络的Lipschitz常数，通过分解大型SDP为小问题实现线性复杂度，并提供局部信息整合算法获得更紧的Lipschitz估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lipschitz常数是衡量神经网络对输入扰动鲁棒性的关键指标，但精确计算是NP难问题，现有方法计算效率低且难以利用局部信息获得更紧的估计。

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，支持异质激活函数和任意输入输出对，然后将其分解为线性复杂度的小子问题序列，并提供闭式解变体实现瞬时计算。

Result: 实验表明算法在多个基准测试中实现显著加速，产生的Lipschitz边界比全局方法更紧，当输入区域足够小时接近自动微分的精确Jacobian值。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效计算紧致的Lipschitz估计，与网络鲁棒性紧密对齐，为神经网络鲁棒性认证提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

TL;DR: 本文通过消融实验比较了编码器专用模型和解码器专用模型在跨模态适应任务中的表现，发现解码器专用模型表现较差，提出了两种新方法（并行翻转和序列加倍）来提升解码器专用模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现优异且扩展性好，但现有的跨模态适应方法主要关注编码器专用模型，需要研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 通过消融实验系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的表现，并提出并行翻转和序列加倍两种新方法来模拟自回归模型中的双向性。

Result: 发现直接应用现有方法时，解码器专用模型表现远差于编码器专用模型，且扩展模型规模也无帮助。提出的两种新方法在所有任务和所有跨模态适应方法中都提升了解码器专用模型的性能，缩小了与编码器专用模型的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于拓宽用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，进一步推动科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

TL;DR: 提出Action Gradient方法，通过直接调整动作来优化Decision Transformer，解决轨迹拼接和动作外推问题，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision Transformer将强化学习与Transformer结合，但存在轨迹拼接和动作外推两个关键挑战。现有方法单独解决这些问题但组合时性能不稳定

Method: 提出Action Gradient方法，利用Q值对动作的梯度来优化动作，实现与策略梯度类似的功能，并能与token预测技术高效集成

Result: 实证结果表明该方法能显著提升基于DT的算法性能，部分结果达到最先进水平

Conclusion: Action Gradient方法有效解决了DT中的关键挑战，实现了稳定且显著的性能提升

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练的深度卷积神经网络比随机模型具有更低的挫败度，表明网络行为更接近结构平衡，表现出近单调性和隐式正则化特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络图结构的挫败度，以测试网络与结构平衡的接近程度，从统计物理和功能角度理解网络的有序性。

Method: 计算预训练深度卷积神经网络的挫败度，并与零模型进行比较，使用Ising自旋玻璃模型和结构平衡理论进行分析。

Result: 所有研究的预训练网络挫败度均低于零模型预期，表明网络编码的紊乱程度更低，功能行为更接近单调函数。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比预期更有序的行为，这揭示了一种新型的隐式正则化形式。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs的两个安全问题：1）传统LLM硬件要求高，无法在消费级设备本地运行，需要网络连接易受攻击；2）敏感任务微调涉及敏感数据，非私有算法易受训练数据再现攻击。

Method: 引入可调节梯度裁剪等工程增强到标准DP-Adam优化器，创建DP-Adam-AC，用于微调两种本地化LLM设计：小语言模型(Qwen2.5-0.5B)和1.58位量化模型(Bitnet-b1.58-2B)。

Result: 通过在两个合成数据集上的实验，展示了损失方面的有前景改进。

Conclusion: 通过增强差分隐私优化算法并将其应用于可本地化语言模型的微调，有效解决了LLMs的安全关切。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Motivation: 传统对抗训练中使用的MSE正则化在优化过程中强制两个输出分布过于均匀，限制了对抗训练场景下的鲁棒性表现。

Method: 提出了两种新正则化策略：1）加权对抗互正则化，使用分解的对抗互KL散度损失，为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重；2）对抗泛化正则化，在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的方法相比现有基于正则化的方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视互学习思想并设计专门针对对抗训练的正则化策略，可以有效解决MSE正则化的局限性，提升模型在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Motivation: 现代传感系统产生高维张量数据，需要既能保持张量几何结构又能捕捉非线性相互作用的回归模型。现有张量回归器保持结构但缺乏非线性，而神经网络提供非线性但破坏空间结构且参数过多。

Method: 引入张量对张量回归神经网络（TRNN），将张量回归与神经网络相结合，在保持张量结构的同时实现非线性建模。

Result: TRNN统一了两种范式，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: TRNN为高维张量数据的非线性回归提供了有效的解决方案，既保持几何结构又具有足够的表达能力。

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

TL;DR: MADPO是一种改进的偏好优化方法，通过实例级别的自适应权重来解决DPO固定温度参数的问题，在情感生成任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPO方法使用固定温度参数，在处理多样化偏好数据时会导致次优训练：容易样本过拟合，信息丰富样本学习不足。现有改进方法如IPO和β-DPO各有局限性。

Method: 采用两步法：首先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，然后使用这些边界为每个训练样本应用连续自适应权重到DPO损失中。这种重加权方案对困难样本放大目标边界，对容易样本减小边界。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO在所有数据集上持续显著优于强基线方法，在高质量数据上性能提升达+33.3%，在低质量数据上提升+10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO为偏好对齐提供了一种更稳健和原则性的方法，具有良好优化的优化景观和对奖励模型估计误差的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Motivation: 传统的非线性无力场求解方法依赖迭代数值方法，计算成本高且效率低。需要一种能够直接从2D边界条件学习3D磁场结构的高效方法。

Method: 结合高效通道注意力机制和扩张卷积来增强模型捕捉多模态输入的能力，通过物理信息损失函数在训练过程中强制执行无力条件和无散条件。

Result: 在ISEE NLFFF数据集上的实验表明，PIANO在准确性上优于最先进的神经算子，并且在重建的各种太阳活动区磁场中与NLFFF数据的物理特性保持高度一致性。

Conclusion: PIANO提供了一种高效准确的非线性无力场求解方法，通过结合注意力机制和物理约束，在保持物理一致性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the

TL;DR: MT-DAO是一种多时间尺度优化器，通过使用多个快慢动量来解决分布式训练中不频繁通信导致的性能下降问题，在语言模型预训练中消除了与DDP的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式数据并行训练中的频繁梯度通信会占用大量带宽，而不频繁通信策略（如Local SGD）在应用于自适应优化器时往往存在性能差距。研究发现这是由于优化器的快速动量衰减过快，无法在长间隔内平滑梯度。

Method: 提出MT-DAO优化器系列，采用多个快慢移动的一阶动量或梯度来跟踪不同时间尺度的更新动态，并提供了首个收敛保证。

Result: 在语言模型预训练中，MT-DAO消除了与DDP的性能差距，在困惑度上优于不频繁通信基线，在以太网互连上减少了6-27%的等令牌墙钟时间。在720M规模下，比单动量DDP基线少用24%的步骤和35%的时间达到目标困惑度。

Conclusion: MT-DAO能够实现有效的跨数据中心训练和广域地理范围内的训练。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

TL;DR: KVLinC是一个通过哈达玛旋转和轻量级线性校正适配器来缓解极低精度KV缓存量化引起的注意力误差的框架，能在保持高压缩率的同时提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存量化是提升大语言模型推理效率的有效策略，但极低精度量化（如2位）会引入显著的键值张量误差，这些误差通过点积注意力机制传播，最终降低生成质量。

Method: 结合哈达玛旋转（减少值量化误差）和轻量级线性校正适配器（显式补偿量化键引入的误差），并实现自定义注意力内核。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen2.5和Qwen3模型系列上的广泛评估显示，KVLinC始终匹配或超越强基线，同时实现更高的KV缓存压缩，推理速度比Flash Attention基线快达2.55倍。

Conclusion: KVLinC框架有效解决了极低精度KV缓存量化带来的注意力误差问题，实现了高效的长期上下文LLM推理。

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Conclusion: S-Pformer通过简化架构和集成频率域自适应编码，有效提升了PINN的性能和效率。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Result: 在两个案例研究（材料变异性和几何多样性）上的实验验证显示，该方法相比从头训练的模型具有显著改进的泛化性能，为制造环境中的智能热控制提供了可扩展的ML解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅为PET预成型件预热提供了有效的温度预测方案，还展示了数据高效泛化策略可扩展到其他涉及复杂物理建模且数据有限的工业应用中。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

*Kangwoo Yi,Bo Shen,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Yong-Jae Moon,Jaewon Lee,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文使用基于LSTM的seq2seq深度学习模型预测太阳质子事件后24小时的质子通量时间剖面，通过多种预测场景比较发现：单次预测优于自回归预测，趋势平滑处理能显著提升质子+X射线模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重辐射危害，准确预测质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解措施至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE事件数据集，基于LSTM的seq2seq模型，采用4折分层交叉验证，比较不同配置：质子输入vs质子+X射线输入、原始数据vs趋势平滑数据、自回归vs单次预测。

Result: 单次预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或逆转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；趋势平滑数据模型平均表现最佳，但最佳模型来自原始数据训练。

Conclusion: LSTM seq2seq模型能有效预测SPE质子通量，单次预测策略和趋势平滑处理是提升性能的关键因素，但模型架构选择有时比数据预处理更重要。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

TL;DR: 提出NoiseCurve方法，利用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率来改进DP-SGD中的跨迭代噪声相关性，在多个数据集和模型上显著提升差分隐私训练的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DP-SGD与普通SGD训练存在较大的精度差距，需要改进隐私保护训练方法。DP-MF通过关联不同迭代的隐私噪声来部分抵消噪声，但噪声关联质量有待提升。

Method: 使用公开无标签数据估计模型曲率，基于曲率信息改进DP-MF中的跨迭代噪声相关性计算，称为NoiseCurve技术。

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和隐私参数上的实验表明，NoiseCurve计算的噪声相关性相比DP-MF的关联方案带来了一致且显著的精度提升。

Conclusion: NoiseCurve通过利用模型曲率信息改进噪声相关性，有效提升了差分隐私随机梯度下降的训练精度。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVI是一个训练感知的自推测解码框架，通过将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在推理过程中将验证决策转化为监督信号来在线更新起草器，实现无损失加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大型语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈，现有推测解码方法需要大量离线训练或额外组件，增加了数据/计算成本且容易受分布漂移影响。

Method: 将LLM划分为起草器和验证器，在生成过程中将验证器的接受/拒绝决策转化为监督信号来在线更新起草器头，采用KL→RL调度通过在线蒸馏引导校准，并添加奖励掩码交叉熵和策略梯度项。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上实现2.16倍实时加速，与EAGLE-2等最先进方法相当，但训练数据量少几个数量级，消融实验显示DVI优于仅使用KL的在线蒸馏。

Conclusion: 训练感知的自推测可以在最小训练开销下提供最先进的无损失加速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Motivation: 传统黑盒学习方法在生物医学建模中存在局限性，需要整合物理定律与数据驱动方法来建模复杂生物医学系统。

Method: 回顾三类PIML框架：物理信息神经网络（PINNs）、神经常微分方程（NODEs）和神经算子（NOs），分析它们在生物力学、生理系统建模和空间异质性模拟中的应用。

Result: PIML已在生物固体/流体力学、机械生物学、医学成像、生理系统动力学、药代动力学和细胞信号传导等领域成功应用，解决了传统方法难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: PIML是生物医学建模的变革性范式，未来需要解决不确定性量化、泛化能力以及与大型语言模型集成等挑战。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习训练LLM代理，使其能够抵御多样化的间接提示注入攻击，同时提高任务完成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御策略依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，缺乏多样性，无法应对新型提示注入攻击，存在安全风险。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈，同时训练攻击者和防御者LLM，并使用基于种群的训练方法防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS训练的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率提高。

Conclusion: 对抗性过程生成了多样化且具有挑战性的攻击，相比基础模型产生了更鲁棒的代理。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究元强化学习，提出两种基于Thompson采样的算法（MTSRL和MTSRL+），通过线性表示和价值函数随机化来学习任务间共享的最优动作价值函数结构，实现了优于先验无关方法的元遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在任务间共享最优动作价值函数相似结构的元强化学习问题，旨在通过学习任务特定的先验分布来提高学习效率，特别是在任务数量较多时超越先验无关方法。

Method: 提出两种Thompson风格算法：MTSRL仅学习先验均值并使用已知协方差进行后验采样；MTSRL+额外估计协方差并采用先验扩展控制有限样本估计误差。还开发了先验对齐技术将学习先验的后验与知道真实先验的元预言机耦合。

Result: 获得了元遗憾保证：已知协方差时为Õ(H⁴S³/²√ANK)，学习协方差时为Õ(H⁴S³/²√AN³K)。当任务数量K超过特定阈值时，两种方法都优于先验无关方法。在状态化推荐环境中的模拟显示MTSRL/MTSRL+能快速跟踪元预言机并显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个为具有学习Q先验的Thompson风格RL提供元遗憾保证的工作，为实验丰富环境提供了实用方法（通过RLSVI预热启动、OLS聚合、协方差扩展）。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J框架在径流预测精度和不确定性量化方面表现优异，特别适用于洪水风险评估和早期预警。

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来减少大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下优于固定精度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，给服务器-客户端分布式训练带来了通信效率和计算开销方面的重大挑战，特别是在低资源设备上的协作训练。

Method: 引入自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)，基于比特正则化按通道分配比特预算，将激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)渐进压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ相比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B等模型上实现约2.5%的生成准确率和1.3%的分类准确率提升，同时显著提高训练稳定性。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，以适度的通信开销提供优越的推理准确率，是低通信成本协作训练的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Conclusion: ATOM代表了向准确、高效和可迁移分子动力学模型迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

TL;DR: NorMuon是一种结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率的优化器，通过神经元级归一化解决Muon优化器中神经元更新不平衡的问题，在大规模语言模型训练中显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器虽然通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何条件，但其更新导致神经元范数高度不均匀，某些神经元主导优化过程。现有研究尚未系统探索结合正交化和自适应学习率的潜力。

Method: 提出NorMuon优化器，在正交化后对每个神经元应用行级归一化，保持神经元级二阶动量统计，并在FSDP2框架下开发高效的分布式实现。

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验表明，NorMuon持续优于Adam和Muon，在11亿参数预训练设置中比Adam提升21.74%训练效率，比Muon提升11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，这为大规模深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上评估，MIDT-ECG显著改善形态一致性，隐私保护指标比基线提升4-8%，导联间相关误差平均降低74%，在低数据情况下合成ECG训练的分类器性能接近仅使用真实数据的分类器。

Conclusion: 采用时频结构正则化方案的ECG合成器可作为个性化、高保真、隐私保护的替代方案，推动生成式AI在医疗领域的负责任应用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

### [134] [Fundamental Limits of Crystalline Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05494)
*Yang Cao,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang,Jiale Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过电路复杂性视角分析了等变图神经网络在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力极限，证明在多项式精度下，这些模型可以被统一TC^0阈值电路族模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管等变图神经网络在材料科学中表现出强大的经验性能，但其在周期性、对称性约束设置下的表达能力仍未被充分理解。

Method: 通过电路复杂性分析EGNN层在节点特征、原子坐标和晶格矩阵上的计算，证明在特定资源约束下这些模型可被TC^0电路族模拟。

Result: 证明了在多项式精度、O(n)嵌入宽度、O(1)层数和O(1)深度条件下，EGNN模型可被统一TC^0阈值电路族模拟。

Conclusion: 该分析为晶体系统中对称感知图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，并指出了超越TC^0能力范围所需的架构改进方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于脑电图(EEG)的疼痛监测系统，使用机器学习模型来区分高疼痛与低/无疼痛状态，在健康成人激光诱发疼痛实验中达到88.9%的准确率，证明了EEG疼痛监测在临床环境中的技术可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医院疼痛评估主要依赖自我报告或非特异性心电图生命体征，这使得危重、镇静和认知受损患者面临疼痛治疗不足和阿片类药物过度使用的风险。EEG提供了一种无创测量脑活动的方法，可作为辅助工具来检测伤害性处理过程。

Method: 研究比较了机器学习模型对高疼痛与低/无疼痛EEG时段的分类能力，使用52名健康成人暴露于三种强度激光诱发疼痛的数据。将每个四秒时段转换为537个特征向量，涵盖频谱功率、频带比率、Hjorth参数、熵测量、相干性、小波能量和峰值频率指标。评估了九种传统机器学习模型，采用留一交叉验证。

Result: 具有径向基函数核的支持向量机实现了最佳离线性能，准确率为88.9%，推理时间低于毫秒(1.02毫秒)。特征重要性分析与当前经典疼痛生理学一致，显示对侧α抑制、中线θ/α增强和额叶γ爆发。实时XGBoost模型保持约4毫秒的端到端延迟和94.2%的准确率。

Conclusion: 基于EEG的疼痛监测器在临床环境中技术上是可行的，为临床验证提供了途径，有望改善危重和无法自我报告患者的疼痛管理。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO是一种针对高维贝叶斯优化的局部方法，通过高斯过程联合学习梯度和海森矩阵信息，并基于牛顿步误差的一步前瞻边界选择评估点，实现了快速收敛和低遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯优化在昂贵黑盒问题上有效，但在高维情况下面临挑战，需要解决计算复杂度和收敛速度的问题。

Method: 使用高斯过程代理模型联合学习梯度和海森矩阵信息，通过牛顿步误差的一步前瞻边界选择评估点，并在低维子空间中优化获取函数以降低计算成本。

Result: 在高维合成和真实世界问题上，包括数千个变量和未知活动子空间的情况，NeST-BO始终比最先进的局部和高维BO基线方法收敛更快、遗憾更低。

Conclusion: NeST-BO通过结合牛顿步目标、误差收缩性质和子空间优化，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF和DPO方法存在偏好数据污染、奖励过优化和冗长性偏差三个严重问题，大多数工作只解决其中一个问题，且缺乏理论保证和计算效率。

Method: 提出RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法，在离线和在线设置下同时缓解这三个问题，DPO-COV无需奖励估计且实现简单，理论证明与RLHF-COV等价。

Result: 理论分析显示DPO-COV在污染数据上获得长度正则化的泛化误差率，与干净数据下的最佳已知率匹配。实验验证了算法在离线和在线设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法能同时有效解决RLHF和DPO训练中的三个关键问题，具有理论保证和实际可行性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Motivation: 图函数模型需要大图进行准确估计，但实践中往往只能获得小规模网络。迁移学习框架可以通过利用相关源图的结构信息来改善小目标图的估计。

Method: GTRANS方法结合邻域平滑和Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输来对齐图结构，包含自适应去偏机制通过残差平滑识别和校正目标特定偏差。

Result: 理论证明了对齐矩阵估计的稳定性，通过大量合成和真实数据实验验证了GTRANS在提高目标图估计精度方面的有效性。

Conclusion: GTRANS显著提高了小目标图的图函数估计精度，并直接转化为下游应用（如图分类和链接预测任务）性能的提升。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

TL;DR: ARMOR是一种新颖的一次性后训练剪枝算法，通过矩阵分解将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵，在保持2:4剪枝推理加速和内存减少的同时，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型部署中的计算和内存需求挑战，现有2:4稀疏剪枝方法通常导致显著的性能下降，需要更好的剪枝技术来平衡模型压缩和任务准确性。

Method: ARMOR算法将每个权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个块对角矩阵包装器，通过块坐标下降算法最小化层间代理损失来选择稀疏核心和块对角包装器。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型家族上的实验表明，ARMOR在各种下游任务和困惑度评估中持续显著优于最先进的2:4剪枝方法，同时保持了推理加速和内存使用减少。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间建立了更有效的权衡，为大型语言模型的实用硬件加速提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA是一种新的测试时自适应方法，通过噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）存在不稳定性和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在小批量或挑战性损坏情况下，这源于在复杂损失表面上过于确定性的更新。

Method: 提出Langevin锚定测试时自适应（LATTA），结合两种关键机制：受随机梯度Langevin动力学启发的噪声权重扰动来探索局部参数空间，以及防止模型偏离鲁棒源预训练的稳定权重锚点。

Result: 在标准基准测试（包括Rotated-MNIST和更具挑战性的CIFAR-10-C）上的广泛实验表明，LATTA显著优于现有方法，在CIFAR-10-C上将平均准确率提高了2%以上，同时降低了性能方差。

Conclusion: LATTA为自监督测试时自适应设定了新的技术水平，无需架构更改或昂贵的蒙特卡洛传递，就能在保持稳定性的同时有效适应分布偏移。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法难以捕捉复杂特征交互，且无法适应分布式场景中的数据不平衡、异构性和隐私限制。需要开发能够在保护隐私的前提下整合各客户端特征选择知识的框架。

Method: 1) 开发隐私保护的知识融合策略，在不共享原始敏感数据的情况下构建统一表示空间；2) 引入样本感知加权策略，处理异构本地客户端之间的分布不平衡问题。

Result: 大量实验验证了该框架的有效性、鲁棒性和效率，在联邦学习场景中展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了分布式特征选择中的隐私保护和数据异构性问题，为联邦学习场景提供了有效的特征选择解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

TL;DR: 论文分析了注意力机制在长上下文中的崩溃问题，发现注意力缩放存在相变现象，临界缩放因子为β_n ∝ log n，这为YaRN和Qwen中的对数缩放提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理更长上下文，注意力层出现注意力分数趋向均匀化的问题，导致token过度聚集（rank-collapse）。虽然注意力缩放通过多对数因子β_n重新缩放注意力分数来缓解此问题，但缺乏理论支持。

Method: 分析了一个简化但可处理的模型，该模型放大了注意力缩放的效果。在模型中，注意力表现出由缩放因子β_n控制的相变现象。

Result: 发现注意力缩放存在临界点：缩放不足会使所有token坍缩到单一方向，而过度缩放会使注意力退化为恒等变换，消除token间的有意义的交互。临界缩放因子为β_n ∝ log n。

Conclusion: 研究为YaRN和Qwen中的对数缩放提供了严格的理论依据，阐明了为什么对数缩放能在长上下文中保持稀疏、内容自适应的注意力机制。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过协作学习和隐私学习的协同设计，实现了高效、隐私保护的嵌入共享方案，支持多种服务器端模型。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random

*Jiashu Tao,Reza Shokri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了InfoRMIA，一种基于信息论的成员推理攻击方法，在性能和效率上都优于现有最佳方法RMIA，并提出token级别的隐私分析新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中会记忆训练数据，导致隐私泄露风险。现有成员推理攻击方法存在局限性，需要更准确和高效的隐私风险评估方法。

Method: 提出InfoRMIA方法，基于信息论原理构建成员推理攻击框架，并扩展到token级别的隐私分析，能够精确定位哪些token被记忆。

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中持续优于RMIA，同时提供更好的计算效率。token级别的分析能够从序列层面定位到单个token的泄露，并在LLMs上实现更强的序列级推理能力。

Conclusion: InfoRMIA为LLM隐私风险评估提供了更准确高效的方法，token级别的隐私分析视角重新思考了LLM中的隐私问题，可以带来更有针对性的缓解措施如精确遗忘。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

*Arindam Chowdhury,Massimiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的基准测试框架，系统评估了图神经网络中消息传递、全局注意力和编码器在原子图学习中的贡献，发现编码器增强的MPNN是稳健基线，而融合局部-全局模型在长程相互作用属性上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于不一致的实现、特征或超参数调优，目前尚不清楚全局注意力机制何时能真正优于经过良好调优的MPNN层，因此需要建立一个受控的基准测试框架来系统评估这些方法的性能。

Method: 构建基于HydraGNN的统一可复现基准框架，包含四种受控模型类别：MPNN、带化学/拓扑编码器的MPNN、MPNN与全局注意力混合的GPS风格模型，以及带编码器的完全融合局部-全局模型。使用七个不同的开源数据集在回归和分类任务上进行系统评估。

Result: 编码器增强的MPNN形成了稳健的基线，而融合局部-全局模型在由长程相互作用效应控制的属性上产生了最明显的优势。研究还量化了注意力的精度-计算权衡，报告了其内存开销。

Conclusion: 这项研究建立了原子图学习中全局注意力的首次受控评估，为未来模型开发提供了一个可复现的测试平台，明确了不同架构在不同任务场景下的适用性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动设备产生大量时间序列数据，需要在不违反数据保护法规的情况下，将预训练模型从充足源时间序列适应到稀疏目标时间序列。

Method: TimePD框架包含三个关键组件：双分支不变解耦特征学习、轻量级无参数代理去噪、以及双向知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimePD平均优于最先进基线方法9.3%。

Conclusion: TimePD是首个源自由时间序列预测框架，通过LLM泛化能力和代理去噪机制，在数据保护约束下实现了有效的领域适应。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

TL;DR: 深度学习存在可预测性的基本极限，源于其吸引盆的复杂分形几何结构，即使初始条件精度大幅提高，也只能获得边际的结果可预测性增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度学习可预测性的基本极限，理解其吸引盆的几何特性如何影响训练结果的再现性。

Method: 通过分析深度学习中的混沌学习动力学和对称性诱导不变子空间等特征，推导出产生复杂吸引盆的充分条件，并揭示其在现实深度网络中的一般路径。

Result: 发现深度学习吸引盆具有无限精细的分形结构，不确定性指数接近零，表明初始条件的微小变化可能导致完全不同的训练结果。

Conclusion: 复杂吸引盆结构对神经网络训练的可预测性和再现性施加了基本限制，这对优化和AI安全部署具有重要影响。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

*Salah Eddine Choutri,Prajwal Chauhan,Othmane Mazhar,Saif Eddin Jabari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种基于蒙特卡罗方法的神经算子框架，用于学习一维偏微分方程的解算子，通过直接学习核函数并使用蒙特卡罗方法近似积分算子，无需傅里叶神经算子的平移不变性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶神经算子依赖于谱表示和假设平移不变核，限制了其应用范围。MCNO旨在提供一种不依赖这些假设的替代方法，探索蒙特卡罗积分在神经算子框架中的应用。

Method: 将核函数表示为可学习张量，在离散网格上均匀随机采样一次，通过插值步骤在不同输入输出网格间映射，实现多分辨率泛化。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中，MCNO以高效计算成本实现了竞争性精度，理论分析证明蒙特卡罗估计器在温和正则性假设下具有有界偏差和方差。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE提供了一种理论支持的替代方法，可自然扩展到高维问题，是谱方法和基于图的蒙特卡罗方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEO是一种超参数免费、计算成本极低的测试时自适应方法，通过将目标数据嵌入重新居中到原点来改善源域和分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法通常计算成本高、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感，因此需要一种更高效、更稳健的TTA方法。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，通过将目标数据嵌入重新居中到原点来改善源域和分布偏移样本的对齐，无需额外计算成本。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上将ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升至59.2%，在多个数据集上优于7种对比方法，在边缘设备上减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于各种ViT架构和数据集，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

### [152] [Quantifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off in Concept-Based Sidechannel Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05670)
*David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS)和SIS正则化方法，用于在概念侧信道模型中平衡准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型(CBNMs)通过概念瓶颈层提供可解释性，但限制了信息流导致准确性下降；概念侧信道模型(CSMs)通过侧信道提高准确性，但牺牲了可解释性。目前缺乏控制这种权衡的原则性方法。

Method: 提出了统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入侧信道独立性评分(SIS)来量化模型对侧信道的依赖，并提出SIS正则化来明确惩罚侧信道依赖以改善可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，仅追求准确性的最先进CSMs具有较低的可解释性，而SIS正则化显著提高了其可解释性、可干预性和学习到的可解释任务预测器的质量。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具，揭示了不同CSM架构中固有的权衡关系。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈检测中，图方法因类别不平衡和图的异质动态特性而难以获得有意义的表示，而表格数据的梯度提升树方法仍占主导地位。

Method: 开发了归纳图梯度提升机(G-GBM)，结合图结构和梯度提升技术，适用于异质动态图的监督学习。

Result: 在模拟随机图实验中与流行图神经网络方法竞争，在开源和专有保险欺诈数据集上展示了强大检测能力。

Conclusion: G-GBM在保险欺诈检测中表现优异，且由于其梯度提升森林基础，能够应用现有可解释性方法获得更好的预测洞察。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

Conclusion: 建立了一个原则性、不确定性感知和结构敏感的量子图神经网络解释方法，为扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

TL;DR: vAttention是一种结合top-k和随机采样的稀疏注意力机制，提供用户指定的(ε,δ)近似精度保证，在保持高效解码的同时显著提升稀疏注意力质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法（top-k和采样）存在根本性限制：无法提供跨头和查询向量的一致近似，且缺乏近似质量保证，限制了实际部署。

Method: 结合top-k和随机采样的互补优势：top-k在注意力分数集中于少数token时表现好，随机采样在注意力分数相对均匀时提供更好估计，并利用采样的统计保证。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（Llama-3.1-8B-Inst和Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B在RULER-HARD上提升约4.5个百分点），在推理场景中实现快速解码而不影响模型质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是第一个具有用户指定精度保证的实用稀疏注意力机制，有效弥合了完整注意力和稀疏注意力之间的差距，支持大规模可靠部署。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了内存和计算成本，无需额外先验知识，并为输出策略的次优性和约束违反建立了严格的理论保证。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: DiffSDA为序列解缠提供了有效的扩散模型框架，并在多种数据模态上表现出优越性能

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Result: 在多个不同场景的数据集上进行对比评估，证明了该模型相比最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和灵活的模式挖掘机制，能够有效揭示数据内在相关性，在不同场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代传统的基于规则的调度方法，用于掩码扩散模型中的去噪过程，通过KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程优化解掩码顺序，在多个基准测试中显著优于启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中性能高度依赖于解掩码顺序的选择，传统基于规则的调度方法（如最大置信度、最大边界）只能提供临时改进，需要更智能的调度策略。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化马尔可夫决策过程，具有显式参考策略，优化一个允许策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标函数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习型策略始终优于最大置信度方法，特别是在SUDOKU任务中，相比随机调度提升20.1%，相比最大置信度提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，证明了在掩码扩散模型中优化解掩码顺序的重要性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

TL;DR: 在4人猎鹿游戏中，简单的单词通信将合作率从0%提升到48.3%；而课程学习在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中反而使收益降低27.4%，可能引发'习得性悲观'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体LLM系统中的合作激发方法，探索直接通信和课程学习两种途径对AI对齐的重要性。

Method: 在猎鹿游戏中测试单词通信机制，在迭代公共物品惩罚游戏中设计渐进复杂游戏的课程学习方案。

Result: 通信是稳健的协调机制，而课程学习对设计选择高度敏感，可能产生负面效果。

Conclusion: 对于协调问题，简单通信协议比基于经验的训练更可靠；社会困境的课程设计需要仔细考虑游戏序列中嵌入的战略教训。

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

*Xiao Yang,Xuejiao Zhao,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过因果效应估计框架系统评估了异构图神经网络(HGNNs)的有效性，发现模型架构对性能没有因果影响，而异构信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多假设HGNNs内在有效，但未系统验证其真正有效性，需要从模型架构和异构信息两个角度深入分析HGNNs的性能来源。

Method: 在21个数据集和20个基线模型上进行系统复现和超参数调优，开发因果效应估计框架，通过事实和反事实分析评估候选因素，并使用最小充分调整集、跨方法一致性检验和敏感性分析验证鲁棒性。

Result: 模型架构和复杂度对性能没有因果影响；异构信息通过增加同质性和局部-全局分布差异产生正向因果效应，使节点类别更易区分。

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要来自异构信息而非模型架构，异构信息通过改善图结构特性来增强节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/YXNTU/CausalHGNN.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了迁移学习场景下多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，发现攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低，且没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险。LiRA在大多数情况下表现最佳，但在高数据量场景下IHA对PatchCamelyon数据集更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模基础模型的出现，训练范式从零开始训练转向迁移学习，这使得在敏感应用中使用小规模领域特定数据集进行高效训练成为可能。需要评估迁移学习场景下的隐私泄露风险。

Method: 在迁移学习设置下比较多种成员推理攻击(MIA)的性能，包括基于分数的攻击和特定攻击方法如LiRA和IHA，使用不同数据集进行实验评估。

Result: 攻击效果随训练数据增加而降低；没有单一MIA能捕获所有隐私风险；LiRA在大多数实验场景中表现最优；在高数据量情况下，IHA对PatchCamelyon数据集更有效。

Conclusion: 迁移学习场景下的隐私风险评估需要多种攻击方法的组合，LiRA是大多数情况下的首选，但在特定高数据量场景下IHA可能更有效。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据的隐私保护框架，通过限制每个SNP序列在训练中的贡献来提供差分隐私保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集对遗传研究至关重要，但共享时存在严重的隐私风险，现有方法要么对统计摘要应用差分隐私，要么需要复杂的后处理和公开数据集。

Method: 使用时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型生成合成SNP序列数据，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献来确保差分隐私保护。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私预算ε∈[1,10]和δ=10^{-4}下有效，合成数据集能紧密复制非私有数据集的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护基因组数据隐私的同时，为研究人员提供了出色的灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

TL;DR: 提出了Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过Entropic Annealing和Look-ahead Modulation技术解决粒子滤波在推理时缩放中的粒子贫化问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波方法在复杂数学推理任务中容易受到过程奖励模型的误导，过早地放弃潜在正确假设，导致粒子贫化问题，特别是在计算预算受限时表现更差。

Method: ePF整合了两种新技术：Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性并在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布来保持探索；Look-ahead Modulation通过评估状态的后续潜力来提供预测性指导。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法将轨迹转换为固定长度表示时导致的信息丢失或特征冗余问题，以及异构数据源和复杂交通动态带来的挑战。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕捉空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态轨迹建模机制自适应调节不同长度轨迹的信息密度，结合对比对齐和掩码语言建模两种自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MDTI始终优于最先进的基线方法，证实了其鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI框架通过多模态轨迹表示学习有效提升了旅行时间估计的准确性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: ESS-Flow为条件生成提供了一种无需梯度的有效方法，特别适用于梯度不可靠或不可用的场景。

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Motivation: 传统网格模拟精确但计算昂贵，而数据驱动的图网络模拟器虽然推理快，但需要为每个物理参数变化重新训练，且数据收集成本高。不同参数的模拟通常共享潜在结构，因此需要一种能学习这种共享结构的方法。

Method: 使用元学习学习共享结构，提出新架构：通过条件神经过程(CNPs)编码图轨迹生成潜在表示，并结合新型神经算子架构来减轻时间上的误差累积。

Result: 在多个具有变化材料属性的动力学预测任务上验证，相比现有图网络方法表现更优，对未见材料属性的准确度接近oracle模型水平。

Conclusion: MaNGO方法成功解决了图网络模拟器对物理参数变化的适应性问题，实现了高效且准确的物理模拟。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Conclusion: 通过平衡组件使用策略，成功解决了现有混合线性注意力方法的缺陷，实现了计算效率和模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度生成模型面临质量与记忆化的基本权衡：高质量样本可能以记忆训练数据而非泛化到数据几何结构为代价。

Method: CDC-FM是流匹配的推广，使用空间变化、各向异性的高斯噪声来正则化概率路径，其协方差捕捉潜在数据流形的局部几何结构。

Result: 在多种数据集（合成流形、点云、单细胞基因组学、动物运动捕捉和图像）和神经网络架构上的实验表明，CDC-FM始终提供更好的质量-泛化权衡，在数据稀缺和高度非均匀采样场景中显著优于标准流匹配。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究生成模型中数据几何、泛化和记忆化之间的相互作用提供了数学框架，并提供可集成到现有流匹配流程中的鲁棒可扩展算法。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: JEPAs的防坍塌项不仅防止表示坍塌，还能估计数据密度，提出JEPA-SCORE方法可从训练好的JEPA模型中高效计算样本概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示JEPAs中防坍塌项的深层作用，证明其能够估计数据密度，为数据管理、异常检测等应用提供新工具。

Method: 通过理论分析证明JEPAs的防坍塌项可估计数据密度，提出JEPA-SCORE方法利用模型Jacobian矩阵高效计算样本概率。

Result: 在合成、控制和Imagenet数据集上验证了理论发现，适用于I-JEPA、DINOv2等JEPA家族方法和MetaCLIP等多模态模型。

Conclusion: JEPAs不仅能学习下游任务表示，还能提供数据密度估计，为数据管理和分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

TL;DR: 提出基于正确性而非置信度的解码策略，通过Greedy-Threshold、Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon等方法在保持多样性的同时提高推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂推理任务中存在矛盾：一方面需要随机性来探索多种推理路径，另一方面需要确保每条路径的质量。传统方法将置信度与答案质量混为一谈，导致探索与可靠性之间的冲突。

Method: 提出基于正确性校准的解码策略：1) Greedy-Threshold在低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样；2) Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon根据估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中显示出性能提升，挑战了关于不确定性下解码的现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，从估计正确性较高的token中采样，在预期正确性较低的地方减少采样，这种方法能更好地平衡探索与可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: 形式化的科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，在数据有限的科学领域实现鲁棒的自监督学习。

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性至关重要，但在实际应用中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能显式表示模型不确定性，在小样本场景下特别有价值

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分方法，比较了5种贝叶斯方法和4种确定性后验OOD评分方法

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，使用5000个或更少训练样本的实验表明，贝叶斯方法优于相应的确定性方法

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测任务中表现更优，验证了贝叶斯神经网络在表示模型不确定性方面的优势

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究过参数化插值机制下Gibbs算法的泛化性能，特别是在低训练误差但可能泛化性能差的情况下（如随机标签），提供理论保证。

Method: 使用数据依赖的边界分析Gibbs算法，通过Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行近似，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 边界在真实标记数据上产生非平凡预测，并能正确上界随机标签的测试误差，表明低温度插值机制下的泛化性能已在高温度机制下的小训练误差中体现。

Conclusion: 提出的数据依赖边界为过参数化插值机制提供了有效的泛化性能分析工具，揭示了不同温度机制下泛化性能的内在联系。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决分子表示学习中交叉验证时的特征泄漏问题，并降低留一法计算成本，开发一种既能保持高性能又能防止数据泄漏的分子表示方法。

Method: 提出molFTP表示方法，采用虚拟掩码程序移除验证集中分子的片段信息，并使用关键留一法近似真实分子级留一法，实现近全数据训练。

Result: 关键留一法与真实分子级留一法的偏差低于8%，在保持无偏交叉验证性能估计的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: molFTP提供了一种快速、抗泄漏的片段-靶标流行度向量化方法，通过虚拟掩码或关键留一法等实用保护措施，以较低成本近似留一法效果。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Conclusion: H-DSAC方法通过有效整合人类指导，为自动驾驶提供了安全高效的学习框架，证明了人机协同在强化学习中的价值。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖外部预训练模型，难以区分数据选择效果与外部模型影响，且忽视数据在模型收敛时的长期影响。

Method: 使用小型代理模型作为LLM替代，通过双层优化训练评分模型来估计训练样本的长期影响，优化样本重要性权重。

Result: 在410M/1B/2.8B模型上验证，1B模型达到同等性能的速度比现有方法快1.7倍，在多个下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BLISS提供了一种高效、无需外部模型的数据选择方法，显著提升LLM预训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Motivation: 传统的时间点过程建模方法依赖自回归参数化，受限于顺序采样。最近的非自回归扩散模型通过离散马尔可夫链中的事件插入和删除来缓解这些问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入编辑流过程，通过插入、删除和替换三种编辑操作在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习瞬时编辑率，实现从噪声到数据的传输。

Result: 无条件训练的模型在基准TPP的各种无条件和条件生成任务中表现出生成灵活性，有效减少了生成过程中必要的编辑操作数量。

Conclusion: 编辑流过程为时间点过程提供了一种灵活高效的建模方法，在减少编辑操作的同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

Motivation: 研究深度图神经网络中导致过平滑效应的因素，量化过平滑程度，并找到缓解该问题的方法。

Method: 提出MASED度量来量化过平滑，推导层间边界，分析权重矩阵奇异值和节点嵌入范数的影响，并引入G-Reg正则化方案。

Result: 实验表明G-Reg正则化能提高节点分类准确率，在深度网络中实现鲁棒性，在冷启动场景下表现优于浅层网络，并展示了感受野大小与性能之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过MASED度量可以量化过平滑，G-Reg正则化能有效缓解深度GNN中的过平滑问题，使深度网络在某些任务中表现优于浅层网络。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Motivation: 当前AI模型在数据分析和可视化中应用广泛，但缺乏针对散点图特定任务的基准测试，限制了对其性能的深入理解。

Method: 创建了来自6个数据生成器和17种图表设计的合成注释数据集，使用N-shot提示法评估OpenAI和Google的专有模型在5个基于聚类边界框、中心坐标和异常值坐标的任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在计数聚类任务上表现良好（准确率90%+），Flash在异常值识别上也表现不错。但定位相关任务的精确率和召回率接近或低于50%，只有Flash在异常值识别上达到65.01%。图表设计影响较小，但应避免宽高比16:9和21:9的散点图或随机着色的图表。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型在散点图分析中，计数任务表现可靠，但定位任务仍有待改进。图表设计选择对性能影响有限，但某些设计应避免使用。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合张量方法和EM算法的混合线性动态系统学习方法，在神经数据分析中实现了可靠的系统参数恢复和条件聚类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合线性动态系统(MoLDS)能建模具有不同时间动态的时间序列数据，但现有方法在复杂噪声环境下存在局限性：张量方法有可识别性保证但抗噪性差，EM方法灵活但对初始化敏感易陷入局部最优

Method: 提出Tensor-EM方法：先用输入输出数据构建矩张量来获得混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，然后用Kalman EM算法进行细化，对所有LDS参数提供闭式更新

Result: 在合成数据上比纯张量方法或随机初始化EM方法更可靠、更鲁棒；在灵长类体感皮层神经记录中成功建模并聚类不同条件；在顺序到达任务神经数据中也验证了有效性

Conclusion: MoLDS是建模复杂神经数据的有效框架，Tensor-EM是学习MoLDS的可靠方法

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

Motivation: RLHF虽然能对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，但其内部学习的奖励信号是隐藏的，这对可解释性和安全性构成挑战。现有IRL方法对所有偏好对同等对待，忽略了最有信息量的失败样本。

Method: 开发了失败感知IRL算法，重点关注被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分相近的样本，通过这些失败样本来学习更准确的奖励函数。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线，无需外部分类器或监督。提取的奖励函数能更好地反映RLHF学习的真实目标。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是一种鲁棒、可扩展的方法，可用于审计模型对齐效果并减少IRL过程中的模糊性，支持更有效的re-RLHF训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Rushiv Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEXPOL是一种基于语言条件混合策略架构的多任务强化学习方法，通过任务元数据（如自然语言描述）来选择和组合子策略，实现跨任务的端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务强化学习通常依赖任务元数据来指导不同目标的行为，但如何有效利用这些元数据来索引和组合可重用技能仍是一个挑战。

Method: 使用文本编码器编码任务元数据，通过学习的门控模块选择和混合多个子策略，支持端到端跨任务训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上达到或超过强大多任务基线，无需任务特定重训练。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据可以有效地索引和重新组合单个策略中的可重用技能，为多任务强化学习提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于贝叶斯逆强化学习的LLM目标审计框架，通过量化不确定性、提供可操作诊断和验证策略级效用来增强LLM对齐的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的隐式优化目标不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过于自信的奖励估计，要么无法解决任务的基本模糊性问题。

Method: 使用贝叶斯逆强化学习恢复目标分布，实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少非可识别性、提供不确定性感知诊断、验证策略级效用。

Result: 框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，产生了一个校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计人员、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM的真正目标，推动AI走向更可信和可问责的方向。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型作为策略不可知的人类代理，生成模拟人类决策的合成数据，以解决异构智能体团队中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友协作的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构智能体团队训练中与策略不可访问或非平稳队友（如人类）协作的挑战，传统方法依赖昂贵的人类参与数据，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用LLaMA 3.1和Mixtral 8x22B等大型语言模型作为策略不可知的人类代理，在受Stag Hunt启发的网格世界捕获游戏中进行了三个实验：比较人类参与者与LLM决策、通过提示诱导风险敏感策略、在动态网格世界中测试LLM生成移动动作。

Result: LLM决策与专家判断更一致，能通过提示诱导产生类似人类的风险敏感行为变化，在动态环境中生成的轨迹与人类参与者路径相似。

Conclusion: 虽然LLM尚不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略不可知队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络取得了显著成功，但我们对其学习机制的理解仍然有限。高维学习通常面临维度灾难的统计难题，但神经网络却能有效学习，这表明可学习数据必须具有潜在的底层结构。

Method: 通过研究数据、任务和深度学习表示中的局部性和组合性作用来探讨这些问题。

Result: 论文分析了数据的潜在结构特性，特别是局部性和组合性在神经网络学习过程中的作用。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络能够成功学习高维数据是因为数据具有特定的潜在结构，特别是局部性和组合性特征，这些结构特性使得统计学习在看似不可行的高维空间中变得可行。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将无监督技能发现算法扩展到高自由度智能体具有挑战性，因为随着维度增加，探索空间呈指数增长，而有意义的技能流形仍然有限。语义意义对于在高维空间中有效引导探索至关重要。

Method: RGSD首先通过对比预训练将运动嵌入到单位超球面上，将每个参考轨迹聚类为不同的方向。这种基础使技能发现能够同时涉及参考行为的模仿和语义相关多样化行为的发现。

Result: 在模拟的SMPL人形机器人（359维观测和69维动作）上，RGSD学习了包括行走、跑步、出拳和侧步的结构化技能，并发现了相关的新行为。在下游控制任务中，RGSD优于基于模仿的技能获取基线方法。

Conclusion: 轻量级的参考引导基础为在高自由度系统中发现语义丰富和结构化的技能提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Motivation: 现有推理方法依赖间接启发式标准（如问题难度或推理链长度），而指令调优虽探索了更广泛的自动选择策略，但很少在推理背景下应用。高质量推理数据的定义仍不明确

Method: 提出使用影响力函数来衡量单个CoT示例对下游准确率的因果影响，并引入基于影响力的剪枝方法

Result: 在模型家族内的数学推理任务中，基于影响力的剪枝方法持续优于困惑度和嵌入基线

Conclusion: 影响力函数为定义推理数据质量提供了有效方法，基于影响力的数据选择策略在推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Stratified GRPO方法来解决LLM搜索代理中轨迹结构异质性导致的跨层偏差问题，通过分层优势归一化在同类轨迹内计算优势值，显著提升了训练效果和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM搜索代理的轨迹存在结构异质性，标准策略梯度方法使用单一全局基线会导致跨层偏差，扭曲信用分配并阻碍复杂多步搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹结构特性将其划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹只与同类轨迹比较。

Result: 在多样单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO相比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，获得更高的训练奖励、更好的训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索代理中的结构异质性提供了原则性解决方案，证明了在RL训练中处理轨迹异质性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD)框架，通过二元分类器来评估图生成模型，解决了现有MMD指标在绝对性能测量和跨描述符可比性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图生成模型评估方法主要依赖基于图描述符的MMD指标，这些指标只能相对排序模型，无法提供绝对性能测量，且对核函数和描述符参数化高度敏感，导致不同描述符间的结果不可比。

Method: 通过训练二元分类器来区分真实图和生成图，使用图描述符作为特征。分类器的数据对数似然近似于两个分布之间JS距离的变分下界。

Result: PGD指标被约束在单位区间[0,1]内，可在不同图描述符间进行比较，并推导出一个理论上有依据的汇总指标来提供最紧的下界。

Conclusion: 实验表明PGD比MMD指标提供更稳健和深入的评估，PolyGraph框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中模型压缩技术虽然能减少模型尺寸和计算成本，但传统评估只关注精度与尺寸的权衡，忽视了模型忠实性这一关键维度。在高风险领域如医疗、金融和刑事司法中，压缩模型必须保持与原模型行为的一致性。

Method: 引入了一组忠实性评估指标，包括使用模型一致性评估预测一致性，应用卡方检验检测整体数据集和人口统计子组中预测模式的统计显著变化，从而揭示聚合公平性指标可能掩盖的偏移。

Result: 在三个多样化且具有社会意义的数据集上对人工神经网络应用量化和剪枝的实验表明，高精度并不保证忠实性，统计测试能检测到标准指标（如精度和均等几率）遗漏的细微但显著的变化。

Conclusion: 所提出的指标提供了一种实用且更直接的方法，确保通过压缩获得的效率增益不会损害可信AI所必需的公平性或忠实性。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 云部署LLM存在数据隐私和可持续性问题，设备端LLM可提供更好的隐私保护和可靠性，但面临内存计算需求大和性能效率权衡不清晰等挑战。

Method: 开发lm-Meter分析器，在商用移动平台上实现，无需辅助设备即可捕获阶段级和内核级的细粒度实时延迟。

Result: lm-Meter在Powersave模式下仅造成2.58%的预填充吞吐量下降和0.99%的解码吞吐量下降，具有高分析精度和最小系统开销。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为受限平台上的LLM运行时行为提供了前所未有的可见性，为优化和加速设备端LLM系统的普及奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了去中心化随机梯度下降(DSGD)算法在高概率(HP)意义下的收敛性，消除了对梯度一致有界等强假设，在轻尾噪声下实现了与均方误差(MSE)收敛相同的条件，同时获得了非凸和强凸成本函数的阶数最优收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化设置中的高概率收敛研究需要强假设条件，如梯度一致有界或渐近消失噪声，导致HP收敛与MSE收敛的假设条件存在显著差距。这与集中式设置形成对比，在集中式设置中SGD在相同的成本函数条件下即可实现HP收敛。

Method: 通过仔细分析感兴趣量(梯度范数平方或最优性间隙)的矩生成函数(MGF)以及用户模型间共识间隙的MGF，提供了去中心化方法在HP意义下方差缩减效应的新结果，并对强凸成本函数的MGF给出了更精细的边界。

Result: DSGD在HP意义下收敛，移除了梯度一致有界和其他限制性假设，同时实现了非凸和强凸成本函数的阶数最优收敛速率，并在用户数量上实现了线性加速，与现有MSE保证相匹配。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了去中心化设置中HP收敛理论的空白，证明了DSGD在HP意义上保持强性能，且在相同条件下同时实现HP和MSE收敛。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Abstract: This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive
next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural
specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and
limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and
learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed
beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to
rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and
empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond
natural language, such as coding and science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然后训练量化被广泛用于大语言模型的高效部署，但量化鲁棒性的底层机制仍不清楚，需要准确评估训练动态与量化性能之间的关系。

Method: 对开源语言模型训练轨迹进行综合分析（最大32B参数和15T训练token），并在控制实验中训练自己的模型（最多100B token），研究训练动态干预措施。

Conclusion: 挑战了增加数据集规模必然损害量化效果的假设，证明通过策略性训练超参数干预可以在大规模下提高量化质量。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.
