The approximation error is measured\nwith respect to the corresponding undirected Laplacian. This notion is\nequivalent to direct Eulerian spectral approximation when the input graph is\nEulerian. Our algorithm achieves an amortized update time of\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2} \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$ and produces a sparsifier of size\n$O(\\varepsilon^{-2} n \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$. Additionally, we present an\nalgorithm that maintains a constant-factor approximation sparsifier of size\n$O(n \\cdot \\text{polylog}(n))$ against an adaptive adversary for\n$O(\\text{polylog}(n))$-partially symmetrized graphs, a notion introduced in\n[Kyng-Meierhans-Probst Gutenberg '22].

Most existing graph-based\nindexes are designed for the static scenario, where there are no updates to the\ndata after the index is constructed. However, full dynamism (insertions,\ndeletions, and searches) is crucial to providing up-to-date responses in\napplications using vector databases. It is desirable that the index efficiently\nsupports updates and search queries concurrently. Existing dynamic graph-based\nindexes suffer from at least one of the following problems: (1) the query\nquality degrades as updates happen; and (2) the graph structure updates used to\nmaintain the index quality upon updates are global and thus expensive. To solve\nthese problems, we propose the CleANN system which consists of three main\ncomponents: (1) workload-aware linking of diverse search tree descendants to\ncombat distribution shift; (2)query-adaptive on-the-fly neighborhood\nconsolidation to efficiently handle deleted nodes; and (3) semi-lazy memory\ncleaning to clean up stale information in the data structure and reduce the\nwork spent by the first two components. We evaluate CleANN on 7 diverse\ndatasets on fully dynamic workloads and find that CleANN has query quality at\nleast as good as if the index had been built statically using the corresponding\ndata. In the in-memory setting using 56 hyper-threads, with all types of\nqueries running concurrently, at the same recall level, CleANN achieves 7-1200x\nthroughput improvement on million-scale real-world datasets.

This is an instance of the classic\nbudgeted maximization problem, which admits an approximation scheme (FPTAS).\nNow assume the agent is performing these tasks on behalf of a principal, who is\nthe one to reap the rewards if the project succeeds. The principal must design\na contract to incentivize the agent. Is there still an approximation scheme? In\nthis work, our ultimate goal is an algorithm-to-contract transformation, which\ntransforms algorithms for combinatorial problems (like budgeted maximization)\nto tackle incentive constraints that arise in contract design. Our approach\ndiverges from previous works on combinatorial contract design by avoiding an\nassumption of black-box access to a demand oracle.\n  We first show how to \"lift\" the FPTAS for budgeted maximization to obtain the\nbest-possible multiplicative and additive FPTAS for the contract design\nproblem. We establish this through our \"local-global\" framework, in which the\n\"local\" step is to (approximately) solve a two-sided strengthened variant of\nthe demand problem. The \"global\" step then utilizes the local one to find the\napproximately optimal contract.

Existing approaches are trained with single-target\nobjectives, which neglect the probabilistic correlations of entity labels,\nespecially in non-target entities. Moreover, previous studies incorporate all\nmodalities statically or adaptively, overlooking the negative impacts of\nirrelevant or misleading information in the incompetent modalities. To address\nthese issues, we introduce a novel Reinforced Multimodal Distillation\nframework, exploiting the Dark Side of Modalities (DSoM) from two perspectives:\n(1) Dark knowledge from non-target entities: We propose to train a unimodal KGR\nmodel through logit distillation to mimic the multimodal soft labels provided\nby pre-trained multimodal teacher models. The multimodal soft labels could\nprovide rich supervision signals with subtle correlations among both target and\nnon-target entities from multiple perspectives. We further decouple logits into\nneighbor entities and non-neighbor entities to divide into two types of\ncorrelations. (2) Dark side in unhelpful modalities: To exclude the adverse\neffects of unhelpful modalities, we introduce a reinforced teacher combination\nmechanism that dynamically selects the optimal set of multimodal teachers for\neach triple.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications.

Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that\n\\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\\mathbf{14\\%}$,\nreduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$\nprecision of $\\mathbf{86\\%}$, while processing videos $ \\mathbf{9.6\\times} $\nfaster than the most accurate baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edfLava\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6d77\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfSQL\u8303\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "Lava\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2) \u89c6\u9891\u4e13\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3) \u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLava\u5728F1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u63d0\u534714%\uff0cMPAE\u964d\u4f4e0.39\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5feb9.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Lava\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Compared to\nLLMs, the Decision Transformer (DT) is a lightweight generative model applied\nto sequential recommendation tasks. However, DT faces challenges in trajectory\nstitching, often producing suboptimal trajectories. Moreover, due to the high\ndimensionality of user states and the vast state space inherent in\nrecommendation scenarios, DT can incur significant computational costs and\nstruggle to learn effective state representations. To overcome these issues, we\npropose a novel Temporal Advantage Decision Transformer with Contrastive State\nAbstraction (TADT-CSA) model. Specifically, we combine the conventional\nReturn-To-Go (RTG) signal with a novel temporal advantage (TA) signal that\nencourages the model to capture both long-term returns and their sequential\ntrend. Furthermore, we integrate a contrastive state abstraction module into\nthe DT framework to learn more effective and expressive state representations.\nWithin this module, we introduce a TA-conditioned State Vector Quantization\n(TAC-SVQ) strategy, where the TA score guides the state codebooks to\nincorporate contextual token information. Additionally, a reward prediction\nnetwork and a contrastive transition prediction (CTP) network are employed to\nensure the state codebook preserves both the reward information of the current\nstate and the transition information between adjacent states.

The results indicate that the adaptive WBP achieves bit\nerror rates (BERs) up to an order of magnitude less than the BERs of the static\nWBP at about the same decoding complexity, depending on the code, its rate, and\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. The second application is a concatenated code\ndesigned for a long-haul nonlinear optical fiber channel where the inner code\nis a QC-LDPC code and the outer code is a spatially coupled LDPC code. In this\ncase, the inner code is decoded using an adaptive WBP, while the outer code is\ndecoded using the sliding window decoder and static belief propagation. The\nresults show that the adaptive WBP provides a coding gain of 0.8 dB compared to\nthe neural normalized min-sum decoder, with about the same computational\ncomplexity and decoding latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4f20\u64ad\uff08WBP\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9759\u6001WBP\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u7801\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94WBP\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff1a\u5e76\u884cWBP\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u6743\u91cd\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94WBP\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u7801\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9759\u6001WBP\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94WBP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Lower latency\nconstraints demand shorter channel coding lengths, which can severely degrade\ndecoding performance. The massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system\nis considered a crucial technology to address this challenge due to its\nabundant spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). While polar codes are theoretically\ncapacity-achieving in the limit of infinite code length, their practical\napplicability is limited by significant decoding latency. In this paper, we\nestablish a unified theoretical framework and propose a novel spatiotemporal\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) polar coding scheme for massive MIMO systems employing\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. The polar transform is jointly\napplied over both spatial and temporal dimensions to fully exploit the large\nspatial DoF. By leveraging the near-deterministic\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) property of MMSE detection, the\nspatial domain is modeled as a set of parallel Gaussian sub-channels. Within\nthis framework, we perform a theoretical analysis of the 2-D polarization\nbehavior using the Gaussian approximation method, and the capacity-achieving\nproperty of the proposed scheme is proved under finite blocklength constraints\nand large spatial DoF. Simulation results further demonstrate that, compared to\ntraditional time-domain polar codes, the proposed 2-D scheme can significantly\nreduce latency while guaranteeing reliability, or alternatively improve\nreliability under the same latency constraint -- offering a capacity-achieving\nand latency-efficient channel coding solution for massive MIMO systems in\nfuture 6G URLLC scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6781\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b35G\u54116G\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e2dURLLC\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77405G\u54116G\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0cURLLC\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6781\u5316\u7801\u56e0\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u800c\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6781\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MMSE\u63a5\u6536\u673a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6781\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7801\u957f\u548c\u5927\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u57df\u6781\u5316\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6216\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u672a\u67656G URLLC\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bb9\u91cf\u53ef\u8fbe\u4e14\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

An alternating\noptimization approach combines convex optimization for beamforming/phase shifts\nwith exhaustive search and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for orientation.\nMajorization-Minimization-based algorithms solve subproblems iteratively.\nSimulation results show the framework achieves 24.1% rate improvement via\nexhaustive search and 20.0% via PSO over the non-rotatable RIS baseline, with\nPSO performance close to the exhaustive search upper bound, highlighting the\nbenefits of physical-layer multicast and orientation optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cRIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u591a\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7ad9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u591a\u64ad\u901f\u7387\u603b\u548c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cRIS\u63d0\u5347\u5f31\u7528\u6237\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u901f\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62/\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u4e0e\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u6216\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\uff08PSO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u4e0d\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cRIS\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e8624.1%\uff08\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u548c20.0%\uff08PSO\uff09\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u65cb\u8f6cRIS\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u591a\u64ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cPSO\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002"}}

The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with\na supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the\nprimary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The\nMAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave\nconsistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with\ninvariance in the conditional distributions.

However,\nthis emerging paradigm introduces two critical challenges. First, the\nsubstantial commercial potential and resource-intensive development raise\nurgent concerns about intellectual property (IP) protection. Second, their\npowerful time series forecasting capabilities may be misused to produce\nmisleading or fabricated deepfake time series data. To address these concerns,\nwe explore watermarking the outputs of LLMTS models, that is, embedding\nimperceptible signals into the generated time series data that remain\ndetectable by specialized algorithms. We propose a novel post-hoc watermarking\nframework, Waltz, which is broadly compatible with existing LLMTS models. Waltz\nis inspired by the empirical observation that time series patch embeddings are\nrarely aligned with a specific set of LLM tokens, which we term ``cold\ntokens''. Leveraging this insight, Waltz embeds watermarks by rewiring the\nsimilarity statistics between patch embeddings and cold token embeddings, and\ndetects watermarks using similarity z-scores. To minimize potential side\neffects, we introduce a similarity-based embedding position identification\nstrategy and employ projected gradient descent to constrain the watermark noise\nwithin a defined boundary.

Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models\n(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign\nrisk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a\ntraining dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134\npatients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct\nfeatures. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper.

Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%).

Compared to traditional systems, inter-user\ninterference in SemCom severely degrades key semantic information, often\ncausing worse performance than Gaussian noise under the same power level. To\naddress this challenge, inspired by the recently proposed concept of Orthogonal\nModel Division Multiple Access (OMDMA) that leverages semantic orthogonality\nrooted in the personalized joint source and channel (JSCC) models to\ndistinguish users, we propose a novel, scalable framework that eliminates the\nneed for user-specific JSCC models as did in original OMDMA. Our key innovation\nlies in shuffle-based orthogonalization, where randomly permuting the positions\nof JSCC feature vectors transforms inter-user interference into Gaussian-like\nnoise. By assigning each user a unique shuffling pattern, the interference is\ntreated as channel noise, enabling effective mitigation using diffusion models\n(DMs). This approach not only simplifies system design by requiring a single\nuniversal JSCC model but also enhances privacy, as shuffling patterns act as\nimplicit private keys. Additionally, we extend the framework to scenarios\ninvolving semantically correlated data. By grouping users based on semantic\nsimilarity, a cooperative beamforming strategy is introduced to exploit\nredundancy in correlated data, further improving system performance.

FRR differs from traditional\nimage restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with\nvarious types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the\nlow-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nMoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert\nisolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts\nhandling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert\ndealing with universal retouching traces.

To mitigate\nthese challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator\n(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate\ncontext-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and\nadaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.\nOur experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG\noutperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in\nterms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the\ncalculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL\nnetwork.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFedDPG\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u987e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7f51\u7edc\uff08FedDPG\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aNLP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFedDPG\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDPG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Due to\nexcellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective\nstate space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud\nlearning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.\nDespite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect\npoint cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we\nexplore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to\naddress the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization\nstrategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of\nS6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality\nlearning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local\ngeometries and global context dependencies synergistically.

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting\nto the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how\nstability is governed by an \"effective reward\" aggregation mechanism.

Additionally, it demonstrated consistent\nimprovements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction\nimage parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.\nThis work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction\ninto structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical\nresearch.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662fAI\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528MLLM\u7684\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u56fe\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5316\u5b66\u53cd\u5e94\u56fe\u5f62\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe80.8%\uff0c\u8fdc\u8d85\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff0835.6%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5c06\u6781\u5927\u63a8\u52a8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, the roles of existing\ndecoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still\nunderexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number\n(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of\nthese fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between\ntwo attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention\n(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query\nparadigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.\nFurthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention\ndisentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many\nprocess), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),\naddressing \"query ambiguity\" and \"ROT\" issues directly, and enhancing decoder\nefficiency.

Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

The\nscale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in\nparameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize\nthat while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to\nemergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in\nthe activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,\nto circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear\nsubspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various\nmodel scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations\nuniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that\nprojecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace\ncan preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear\nstructures.

We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)\nfor dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important\nresearch challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility\nresource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility\nresource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across\nagents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);\nand (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale\nsetting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel\ndesigns within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we\nhave designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local\ninformation of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility\nresources).

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

Though\neffective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly\nprocess all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic\ndifferences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a\nstructure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology\nalong with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,\nSAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive\nState Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with\nleveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint\nfeature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than\nsequential state transitions.

The method incorporates a\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts\nto enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is\ncapable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these\nto extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired\nstructural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and\nevaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural\ndrawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly\nreducing the workload compared to current working process associated with\nmanual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of\nengineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u7eb8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u7eb8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8f6f\u4ef6\u80fd\u529b\u867d\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aAutoCAD\u56fe\u7eb8\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u56fe\u7eb8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u8fbe\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4fbf\u6377\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable\nknowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.\nMoreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct\npreference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection\nbetween forgetting and retained knowledge.

In this work, we propose Gradient Null\nSpace Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects\ntask-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.\nThis orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous\ntasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,\nto preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce\nknowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation\nloss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal\nembedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11\ntasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key\nmetrics.

To bridge this\ngap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose\na unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,\nmethodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the\nconnections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,\nreinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We\nfurther highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in\nreal-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future\nresearch directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements\nin this field.

Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are\nusually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have\nbeen widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their\nsuperior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the\nreal-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear\nself-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this\nissue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for\nits adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\nparticularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to\ncombine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate\ngeneration of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and\nMamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance\nsegmentation tasks.

Second-order methods, which use curvature\ninformation from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are\ncomputationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order\ntechnique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry\nof a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only\ngradient information.

DEO adapts the\nDimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating\nthe Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By\nperiodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the\nminimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points\nand flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.\nPreliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves\ncompetitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving\nnavigation of complex loss landscapes.

Existing methods typically demand substantial training\nsamples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios.

In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused\nCLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local\ndefects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes\nanomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both\nclass-level features for image classification and patch-level features for\nprecise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve\ndetection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial\naggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.\nComplementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts\nthat generically characterize normal and abnormal states.

We then propose a straightforward method\nto induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing\nthe effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.\nWe show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves\ngeneralization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting\nneural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u5982\u4f55\u514b\u670d\u65e9\u671f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u201c\u9996\u8981\u504f\u5dee\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u56e0\u65e9\u671f\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u201c\u9996\u8981\u504f\u5dee\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u66f4\u65b0\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6bd4\u7387\uff09\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982grokking\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e2d\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u514b\u670d\u9996\u8981\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Vision Mamba employs\none-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global\ndependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch\ntokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a\nlow-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information\nCapture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation\n(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD.

In this paper, we introduce Meta\nFusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing\nstrategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble\nlearning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various\ncombinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts\npredictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort.

It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain\nto a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label\ndistribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the\nlabel distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,\nthe simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and\nsufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on\nthe source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based\nshift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a\nbuilt sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as\nthe target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for\nIS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated\nby IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture\ndistribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be\nconnected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build\nIS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence\ncriterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the\ncomputation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios.

Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content.

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences.

A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

Existing Graph Active\nLearning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques\nlike \"clique expansion,\" which destroys the high-order structural information\ncrucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.\nTo address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a\nnative active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs.

Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited\ncontext lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies\ncomprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's\njudgment on \"precedents\", which are the reasoning processes of prior data\npoints similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed\npolicies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the\nguardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for\ncollecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents\nfor robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios\nand exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u5148\u4f8b\u201d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u62a4\u680f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u62a4\u680f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u653f\u7b56\u6216\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u653f\u7b56\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6574\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u201c\u5148\u4f8b\u201d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6279\u5224-\u4fee\u8ba2\u673a\u5236\u6536\u96c6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5148\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u65b0\u653f\u7b56\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u4f8b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u62a4\u680f\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,\nthough reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.\nMPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening\nstrategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the\nmerging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential\nstructural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive\nlearning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and\ncluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature\nmasking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during\nmulti-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL\ndivergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures\ncross-scale consistency of node representations.

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN).

The system's effectiveness is\nrigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1\nscore, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world\napplications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe\nfor precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of\ndynamic gestures.

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data.

We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration.

Although existing methods perform adequately\nduring certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)\nRepresentation learning from local or complete protein sequences often\noverlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are\nessential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)\nDependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands\nsignificant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and\nefficiency.

To address this\nissue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave\ninfrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion\ndetection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature\ninteraction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,\nachieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive\nfused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images\nand improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the\nMulti-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive\nfused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple\nmodalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.\nMoreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object\nEnhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object\nsemantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary\nfused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,\nthereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a\nNearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective\nSWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this\nfield.

Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a\ncontrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic\nalignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order\nsemantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete\ninference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level\nsemantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the\ninformation fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation\nand identification capability for anomalous events.

Unlike traditional\napproaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect\nSmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations.

Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a\npre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch\nexpert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding\nstorage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

To ensure smoothness and correct color\nordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap\nrepresentation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.\nWe evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset\nand a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --\ncolormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to\nvisualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color\npalettes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece2D\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8272\u5f69\u56fe\u4f8b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f202D\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u7eed\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u79bb\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u548c\u989c\u8272\u987a\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08VIS30K\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u56fe\u4f8b\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

It is hypothesized that as more data points\nare accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted\nwithin the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the\nprediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for\nsequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the\nmost recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the\ninfluence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions\nwith fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6700\u8fd1\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316FMA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFMA\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u505c\u6ede\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u8d21\u732e\u88ab\u7a00\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u8fd1\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u6307\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684FMA\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86FMA\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u505c\u6ede\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Project page:\n  https://jacky1128.github.io/RepMTL/", "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely\nvisual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable\nreasoning models without requiring explicit supervision.

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a\ndistilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more\nefficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with\nUnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase\nin the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and\nself-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks.

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes.

Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial\ndatasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.\nProject page is available at: https://humansensinglab.github.io/AGenDA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u5e03\u5c40\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\u7f29\u5c0f\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAP50\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53474-23%\u30016-10%\u30017-40%\u548c50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u548c\u72b9\u4ed6\u5dde\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the\nfocus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,\nwhich emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid\nadvances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has\nevolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,\nexisting surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical\nstructure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new\nperspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D\nspatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes\n(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene\ncomponents (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction\nof 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene\ncomponents; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.\nWe conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and\nhighlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D\nspatial intelligence.
