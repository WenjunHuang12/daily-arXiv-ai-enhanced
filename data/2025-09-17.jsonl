Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two\nlimitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals\nin the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)\nprevious instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while\nignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of\nmobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph\nTokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).\nSpecifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)\nformat, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous\ninformation. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into\nan individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,\nthus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB\nproposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific\nprediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit\nbehaviors.

In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel\nmetric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct\nanswer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference\nof LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.\nFurther, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to\ntrain a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from\nexact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can\neffectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones\nfor better answer generation.

Moreover, LSS is designed to\nfurther obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.\nFinally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed\nFIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models."}

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input.

In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

However,\napplying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential\nand structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,\na canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs\nacross key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this\nbenchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results\nfirst reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to\nmeet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,\nlike QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as\nLlama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated\nreasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to\nthe various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,\nIn-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently\noffering the best performance.

The primary\nissue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,\ncausing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon\nknown as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can\npartially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and\nover-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data\ndistributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,\nenable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face\nchallenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of\ntasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases\nthe potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical\nAdapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters\nfrom different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale\neffectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with\nimproved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that\nhierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank\nadapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on\nadapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,\nfacilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on\nthree vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases."}

However, whether large language models (LLMs) can\naccurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of\nfoods consumed remains unknown.

METHODS: We used\n24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM\nwas prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and\nfive macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their\nquantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate\nwhether predictive accuracy improved.

In the offline\nphase, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations\nfor each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model\non these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only\nthe ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore,\n\\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant\nefficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy\nmodel to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade\nmechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific\naccuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that\n\\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces\nexpensive LLM invocations by up to 85\\%, making large-scale semantic analysis\npractical and efficient."}

In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to\nforecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using\nhistorical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research\nemploys a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support\nVector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly\nweight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of\nmodels, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather\ndata (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better\nthan the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,\nRMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were\nincluded. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors\nsignificantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF\nmodel outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings\ndemonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight\ngain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic\nfactors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an\ninnovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB\nCWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist\nin preparing datasets for current and future analytical research.."}

While StarCraft II-related environments have driven\nsignificant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on\nmicromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic\nintelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL\nbenchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical\nstratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a\nspecific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic\nelements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,\nthereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making\ncapabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond\nconventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,\nto assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We\nintegrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our\nbenchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that\nHLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic\ndecision-making."}

Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as\nconventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment\nwith shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation\nstrategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by\napplying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language\nModel (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained\ntoken-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to\nusing coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can\nbe used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate\nrecommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our\nmechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over\nbenchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings\nshow that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit\nRate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same\ncapability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more\ninterpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The\npractical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,\nbut nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the\nzero-shot setting is indicated within this work."}
