While resolution of points-of-interest (POIs) has been widely\naddressed, resolution of entities with diverse geometries has been largely\noverlooked. This is partly due to the lack of a uniform technique for embedding\nheterogeneous geometries seamlessly into a neural network framework. Existing\nneural approaches simplify complex geometries to a single point, resulting in\nsignificant loss of spatial information. To address this limitation, we propose\nOmni, a geospatial ER model featuring an omni-geometry encoder. This encoder is\ncapable of embedding point, line, polyline, polygon, and multi-polygon\ngeometries, enabling the model to capture the complex geospatial intricacies of\nthe places being compared. Furthermore, Omni leverages transformer-based\npre-trained language models over individual textual attributes of place records\nin an Attribute Affinity mechanism. The model is rigorously tested on existing\npoint-only datasets and a new diverse-geometry geospatial ER dataset. Omni\nproduces up to 12% (F1) improvement over existing methods.\n  Furthermore, we test the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct\ngeospatial ER, experimenting with prompting strategies and learning scenarios,\ncomparing the results of pre-trained language model-based methods with LLMs.\nResults indicate that LLMs show competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOmni\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5730\u7406\u5b9e\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "Omni\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u3001\u7ebf\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u7b49\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "Omni\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534712%\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Omni\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6LLMs\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

These characteristics make its core vector\nembeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible\nto being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the\noriginal audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital\nwatermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical\nrepresentations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach\nto safeguarding the embeddings themselves.

This paper introduces a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS) designed to extract and analyze narrative arcs by implementing\nprinciples of computational memory architectures. The system conceptualizes\nnarrative understanding through analogues of human memory: Large Language\nModels (LLMs) provide a form of semantic memory for general narrative patterns,\nwhile a vector database stores specific arc progressions as episodic memories.\nA multi-agent workflow simulates working memory processes to integrate these\ninformation types. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-),\nthe MAS identifies three arc types: Anthology (self-contained), Soap\n(relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific. These arcs and their episodic\ndevelopments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis\nand semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a\ngraphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's\nnarrative memory. While demonstrating strong performance in identifying\nAnthology Arcs and character entities, the system's reliance on textual\nparatexts (episode summaries) revealed limitations in discerning overlapping\narcs and opaque dynamics, underscoring the challenges in computational memory\nconsolidation versus human holistic understanding.

In this paper, we aim to resolve\nthis issue. First, we present an exact time-domain signal model for OFDM-based\ngrant-free access under frequency-selective fading. Then, we present a maximum\na posteriori (MAP)-based device activity detection problem and two minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE)-based channel estimation problems. The MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and one of the MMSE-based channel estimation\nproblems are formulated for the first time. Next, we build a new factor graph\nthat captures the exact statistics of time-domain channels and device\nactivities. Based on it, we propose two approximate message passing (AMP)-based\nalgorithms, AMP-A-EC and AMP-A-AC, to approximately solve the MAP-based device\nactivity detection problem and two MMSE-based channel estimation problems.

This paper introduces a\nCUDA-accelerated computational framework for simulating Pasur, emphasizing\nefficient memory management. We use our framework to compute near-Nash\nequilibria via Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), a well-known algorithm\nfor solving large imperfect-information games.\n  Solving Pasur presents unique challenges due to its intricate rules and the\nlarge size of its game tree. We handle rule complexity using PyTorch CUDA\ntensors and to address the memory-intensive nature of the game, we decompose\nthe game tree into two key components: (1) actual game states, and (2)\ninherited scores from previous rounds. We construct the Full Game Tree by\npairing card states with accumulated scores in the Unfolding Process. This\ndesign reduces memory overhead by storing only essential strategy values and\nnode connections. To further manage computational complexity, we apply a\nround-by-round backward training strategy, starting from the final round and\nrecursively propagating average utilities to earlier stages. Our approach\nconstructs the complete game tree, which on average consists of over $10^9$\nnodes.

In\nspite of this, advancements in technology have resulted in breaches of privacy\nand data security. When it comes to protecting private information in today's\nInternet era, digital steganography is vital. Many academics are interested in\ndigital video because it has a great capability for concealing important data.\nThere have been a vast number of video steganography solutions developed lately\nto guard against the theft of confidential data. The visual imperceptibility,\nrobustness, and embedding capacity of these approaches are all challenges that\nmust be addressed. In this paper, a novel solution to reversible video\nsteganography based on DWT and QR codes is proposed to address these concerns.\nIn order to increase the security level of the suggested method, an enhanced\nElGamal cryptosystem has also been proposed. Prior to the embedding stage, the\nsuggested method uses the modified ElGamal algorithm to encrypt secret QR\ncodes. Concurrently, it applies two-dimensional DWT on the Y-component of each\nvideo frame resulting in LL, LH, HL, and HH sub-bands.

This extends the recent study of tail bounds\nfor ski rental by [Dinitz et al. SODA 2024] to the two-slope version defined by\n[Lotker et al. IPL 2008]. In this version, even after \"buying,\" we must still\npay a rental cost at each time step, though it is lower after buying. This\nmodels many real-world \"rent-or-buy\" scenarios where a one-time investment\ndecreases (but does not eliminate) the per-time cost.\n  Despite this being a simple extension of the classical problem, we find that\nadding tail risk bounds creates a fundamentally different solution structure.\nFor example, in our setting there is a possibility that we never buy in an\noptimal solution (which can also occur without tail bounds), but more strangely\n(and unlike the case without tail bounds or the classical case with tail\nbounds) we also show that the optimal solution might need to have nontrivial\nprobabilities of buying even at finite points beyond the time corresponding to\nthe buying cost. Moreover, in many regimes there does not exist a unique\noptimal solution. As our first contribution, we develop a series of structure\ntheorems to characterize some features of optimal solutions.\n  The complex structure of optimal solutions makes it more difficult to develop\nan algorithm to compute such a solution. As our second contribution, we utilize\nour structure theorems to design two algorithms: one based on a greedy\nalgorithm combined with binary search that is fast but yields arbitrarily close\nto optimal solutions, and a slower algorithm based on linear programming which\ncomputes exact optimal solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4e24\u659c\u7387\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u201c\u79df\u6216\u4e70\u201d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5bf9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\u5206\u6790\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4e8c\u5206\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u65e0\u9650\u671f\u4e0d\u8d2d\u4e70\u6216\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u8d2d\u4e70\u6982\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e14\u89e3\u4e0d\u552f\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u7406\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e24\u659c\u7387\u6ed1\u96ea\u79df\u8d41\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, existing research has predominantly\nfocused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from\nan interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where\nparticipation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game\nmodel to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and\ncooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In\nthe pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once\nin the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on\nthe formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation\nboosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead\nto widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare\ntwo institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that\nrewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible\none (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the\ngame. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better\nfor promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an\nopportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient\nalternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour\nresults in a high gain.

Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy and robustness\ncompared to traditional methods. Specifically, our framework achieved an\naverage accuracy of 74.06\\% across all tested sites, showcasing its\neffectiveness in handling subtype heterogeneity and enhancing model\ngeneralizability. Ablation studies further confirmed the importance of both the\ndynamic navigation and meta-integration modules in improving performance.

The block error rate performance of the GLDPC codes, combined\nwith a complementary outer code, has been shown to outperform a variety of\nstate-of-the-art code and decoder designs with suitable lengths and rates for\nthe 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) regime.

In this paper, we analyze\npractical constructions of quasi-cyclic GLDPC (QC-GLDPC) codes and show how to\nconstruct polynomial generator matrices in various forms using minors of the\npolynomial matrix. The approach can be applied to fully generalized matrices or\npartially generalized (with mixed constraint node types) to find better\nperformance/rate trade-offs. The resulting encoding matrices are presented in\nuseful forms that facilitate efficient implementation. The rich substructure\ndisplayed also provides us with new methods of determining low weight\ncodewords, providing lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance and often\ngiving those of weight equal to the minimum distance. Based on the minors of\nthe polynomial parity-check matrix, we also give a formula for the rank of any\nparity-check matrix representing a QC-LDPC or QC-GLDPC code, and hence, the\ndimension of the code.

In this\npaper, we investigate whether filtering text about dual-use topics from\ntraining data can prevent unwanted capabilities and serve as a more\ntamper-resistant safeguard. We introduce a multi-stage pipeline for scalable\ndata filtering and show that it offers a tractable and effective method for\nminimizing biothreat proxy knowledge in LLMs. We pretrain multiple\n6.9B-parameter models from scratch and find that they exhibit substantial\nresistance to adversarial fine-tuning attacks on up to 10,000 steps and 300M\ntokens of biothreat-related text -- outperforming existing post-training\nbaselines by over an order of magnitude -- with no observed degradation to\nunrelated capabilities.

In contrast to the abelian case, we show that for non-abelian valued\nequations, super-polynomially many linear equations must be preserved in order\nto approximately preserve the number of satisfied equations for any input.\nTogether with our Cayley graph sparsification result, this provides a formal\nseparation between Cayley graph sparsification and sparsifying linear\nequations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Cayley\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u8c31\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Cayley\u56fe\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u5c11\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc1\u660eCayley\u56fe\u8c31\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5668\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Cayley\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u8c31\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u7a0b\u624d\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Cayley\u56fe\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5728\u975e\u963f\u8d1d\u5c14\u7fa4\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\u3002"}}

A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities", "comment": null, "summary": "Multimodal recommendation (MMRec) has emerged as a mainstream paradigm,\ntypically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained\nmodels such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is\nfounded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings\ncan enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this\nassumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical\nresearch gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this\npaper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer\nthis question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of\ntext and visual embeddings in modern MMRec models, both as a whole and\nindividually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do\nmultimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is\neach individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate\nthe effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality\nknockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant\nvalues or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study,\nwe evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art MMRec models. Our findings reveal\nthat: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance -\nparticularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion\nmodels. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion\nschemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality\nalone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most\ncases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer\nfoundational insights and practical guidance for the MMRec community.

Real-life data, like images, is often\nspatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion\nmodels ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions,\nwhich are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new\nperspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into\nconstructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two\ndistributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be\nmutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.\nThen, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial\nphase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local\ndenoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an\ninformation-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on\nconditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a\nreal-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures\nof diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small\nlocal neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are\nonly necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions.

Traditionally, this\nprocess depends on manually designed nonlinear transformations (e.g.,\npolynomial or exponential functions) and hand-tuned fusion weights to balance\ncompeting goals -- an approach that is labor-intensive and frequently\nsuboptimal in achieving Pareto efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel\nUnified Monotonic Ranking Ensemble (UMRE) framework to address the limitations\nof traditional methods in ensemble sorting. UMRE replaces handcrafted\ntransformations with Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Networks (UMNN), which\nlearn expressive, strictly monotonic functions through the integration of\npositive neural integrals.

In\nreal-world applications, a user's historical interactions often serve as the\nfoundation for solving a wide range of predictive tasks, such as churn\nprediction, recommendations, or lifetime value estimation. Using a\ntask-independent user representation that is effective across all such tasks\ncan reduce the need for task-specific feature engineering and model retraining,\nleading to more scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines. The goal of\nthe RecSys Challenge 2025 by Synerise was to develop such Universal Behavioral\nProfiles from logs of past user behavior, which included various types of\nevents such as product purchases, page views, and search queries.

At each\ntime slot, a controller decides whether to sample the environment and if so\nwhether to transmit a raw or processed sample, to the controller. Processing\nimproves transmission reliability over an unreliable wireless channel, but\nincurs an additional cost. The objective is to minimize the long-term average\nage of information (AoI), subject to constraints on the costs incurred at the\nsource and the cost of actuation error (CAE), a semantic metric that assigns\ndifferent penalties to different actuation errors. Although reducing AoI can\npotentially help reduce CAE, optimizing AoI alone is insufficient, as it\noverlooks the evolution of the underlying process. For instance, faster source\ndynamics lead to higher CAE for the same average AoI, and different AoI\ntrajectories can result in markedly different CAE under identical average AoI.\nTo address this, we propose a stationary randomized policy that achieves an\naverage AoI within a bounded multiplicative factor of the optimal among all\nfeasible policies.

However,\ncurrent joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with\nthe existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the\nsources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is\nsuboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we\npropose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over\nparallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic\nsource coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed\nand adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and\nchannel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as\nfunctions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic\nregression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E\ndistortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power\nallocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex\napproximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC\nscheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and\nparallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical\ndigital systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff08ASCC\uff09\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff08SemComs\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u5408\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff08JSCC\uff09\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6e90\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dSemComs\u4e2d\u7684JSCC\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u6e90\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u79bb\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff08SSCC\uff09\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5757\u957f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faASCC\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DNN\u8bed\u4e49\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u5b57\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5efa\u6a21\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u5408\u6e90\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u548c\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cASCC\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5355\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6JSCC\u548cSSCC\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u517c\u5bb9\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "ASCC\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce a multi-level advantage formulation that\nperforms explicit counterfactual reasoning to infer credits across distinct\nlevels. Our method, Multi-level Advantage Credit Assignment (MACA), captures\nagent contributions at multiple levels by integrating advantage functions that\nreason about individual, joint, and correlated actions. Utilizing an\nattention-based framework, MACA identifies correlated agent relationships and\nconstructs multi-level advantages to guide policy learning. Comprehensive\nexperiments on challenging Starcraft v1\\&v2 tasks demonstrate MACA's superior\nperformance, underscoring its efficacy in complex credit assignment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MACA\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MARL\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u7ea7\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMACA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u516c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u8054\u5408\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u8bc6\u522b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728Starcraft v1\u548cv2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMACA\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MACA\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u4f18\u52bf\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ea7\u534f\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution.

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment.

In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions.

While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape\npremature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued\nproblems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three\nfactors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e.,\nover-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty\naccumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we\npropose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs\nthat incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize\nconstraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the\nmagnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty\nupdates.

This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath. These results provide a mechanistic explanation of how trained\ntransformers can implement sequential algorithmic procedures.

We propose a theoretical\nHeteRo-Select framework designed to maintain high performance and ensure\nlong-term training stability. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that\nwhen client data is very different (high heterogeneity), choosing a smart\nsubset of client participation can reduce communication more effectively\ncompared to full participation. Our HeteRo-Select method uses a clear,\nstep-by-step scoring system that considers client usefulness, fairness, update\nspeed, and data variety. It also shows convergence guarantees under strong\nregularization. Our experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset under\nsignificant label skew ($\\alpha=0.1$) support the theoretical findings. The\nHeteRo-Select method performs better than existing approaches in terms of peak\naccuracy, final accuracy, and training stability.

Recent single-stage\nmethods attempt to unify SFT and RL using heuristics, but lack a principled\nmechanism for dynamically balancing the two paradigms. In this paper, we\nreframe this challenge through the theoretical lens of \\textbf{implicit\nrewards}, viewing SFT and RL not as distinct methods but as complementary\nreward signals. We introduce \\textbf{Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT)}, a novel\nsingle-stage algorithm that learns the optimal balance between SFT's implicit,\npath-level reward and RL's explicit, outcome-based reward. The core of AMFT is\na \\textbf{meta-gradient adaptive weight controller} that treats the SFT-RL\nbalance as a learnable parameter, dynamically optimizing it to maximize\nlong-term task performance.

Specifically, BoRA treats the product $BA$ as a block\nmatrix multiplication, where $A$ and $B$ are partitioned into $b$ blocks along\nthe columns and rows, respectively (i.e., $A=[A_1,\\dots,A_b]$ and\n$B=[B_1,\\dots,B_b]^\\top$). Consequently, the product $BA$ becomes the\nconcatenation of the block products $B_iA_j$ for $i,j\\in[b]$. To enhance the\ndiversity of different block products, BoRA introduces a unique diagonal matrix\n$\\Sigma_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$ for each block multiplication,\nresulting in $B_i \\Sigma_{i,j} A_j$. By leveraging these block-wise diagonal\nmatrices, BoRA increases the rank of LoRA weights by a factor of $b$ while only\nrequiring $b^2r$ additional parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple\ndatasets and models demonstrate the superiority of BoRA, and ablation studies\nfurther validate its scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "BoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c11\u91cf\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u5347LoRA\u6743\u91cd\u79e9\u3002", "motivation": "LoRA\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u79e9\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002BoRA\u65e8\u5728\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u79e9\u3002", "method": "BoRA\u5c06LoRA\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5757\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u4e58\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u79e9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eBoRA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5757\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer.

While Behavioral Cloning (BC) offers a straightforward\napproach to imitation learning, policies trained with BC are notoriously\nbrittle and suffer from compounding errors in closed-loop execution. This work\npresents a comprehensive pipeline and a comparative study to address this\nlimitation. We first develop a series of increasingly sophisticated BC\nbaselines, culminating in a Transformer-based model that operates on a\nstructured, entity-centric state representation. While this model achieves low\nimitation loss, we show that it still fails in long-horizon simulations. We\nthen demonstrate that by applying a state-of-the-art Offline Reinforcement\nLearning algorithm, Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), to the same data and\narchitecture, we can learn a significantly more robust policy. Using a\ncarefully engineered reward function, the CQL agent learns a conservative value\nfunction that enables it to recover from minor errors and avoid\nout-of-distribution states. In a large-scale evaluation on 1,000 unseen\nscenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, our final CQL agent achieves a\n3.2x higher success rate and a 7.4x lower collision rate than the strongest BC\nbaseline, proving that an offline RL approach is critical for learning robust,\nlong-horizon driving policies from static expert data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u800c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08BC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684BC\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5CQL\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCQL\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863.2\u500d\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e867.4\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

While RL\ndrives this self-improvement paradigm, a recent study (Gandhi et al., 2025)\nshows that RL alone does not truly instill these new reasoning abilities - it\nmerely draws out behaviors already present in the base models. This raises a\nquestion: How can we train the models that don't exhibit such thinking behavior\nto develop it in the first place? To this end, we propose ThinkTuning, a\nGRPO-based interactive training approach where we augment the rollouts of a\nstudent model with the guidance from a teacher model.

Each piece of feedback\nreshapes the student's thoughts, leading them to arrive at the correct\nsolution. Similarly, we find that this type of implicit supervision through\nfeedback from a teacher model of the same size improves the reasoning\ncapabilities of the student model.

However, most existing works model spatial and\ntemporal transitions separately, leading to misaligned representations of the\nsame spatial-temporal key nodes. This misalignment introduces redundant\ninformation during fusion, increasing model uncertainty and reducing\ninterpretability. To address this issue, we propose DiMuST, a socially enhanced\nPOI recommendation model based on disentangled representation learning over\nmultiplex spatial-temporal transition graphs. The model employs a novel\nDisentangled variational multiplex graph Auto-Encoder (DAE), which first\ndisentangles shared and private distributions using a multiplex\nspatial-temporal graph strategy.

The method abstracts system states at different time slices into a\nsequence of graph structures. It integrates the runtime features of service\nnodes with the invocation relationships among services to construct a unified\nspatiotemporal modeling framework. The model first applies a graph\nconvolutional network to extract high-order dependency information from the\nservice topology. Then it uses a gated recurrent network to capture the dynamic\nevolution of performance metrics over time. A time encoding mechanism is also\nintroduced to enhance the model's ability to represent non-stationary temporal\nsequences. The architecture is trained in an end-to-end manner, optimizing the\nmulti-layer nested structure to achieve high-precision regression of future\nservice performance metrics. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, a large-scale public cluster dataset is used. A series of\nmulti-dimensional experiments are designed, including variations in time\nwindows and concurrent load levels. These experiments comprehensively evaluate\nthe model's predictive performance and stability.

Most existing research focuses on\ncombining evidence within the same frame of discernment. However, in real-world\nscenarios, trained algorithms or data often originate from different regions or\norganizations, where data silos are prevalent. As a result, using different\ndata sources or models to generate basic probability assignments may lead to\nheterogeneous frames, for which traditional fusion methods often yield\nunsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, this study proposes an\nopen-world information fusion method, termed Full Negation Belief\nTransformation (FNBT), based on the Dempster-Shafer theory. More specially, a\ncriterion is introduced to determine whether a given fusion task belongs to the\nopen-world setting. Then, by extending the frames, the method can accommodate\nelements from heterogeneous frames. Finally, a full negation mechanism is\nemployed to transform the mass functions, so that existing combination rules\ncan be applied to the transformed mass functions for such information fusion.\nTheoretically, the proposed method satisfies three desirable properties, which\nare formally proven: mass function invariance, heritability, and essential\nconflict elimination.

Prior work has shown that ICL emerges in transformers due to\nthe presence of special circuits called induction heads. Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training.

The Mixture\nof Experts (MoE) architecture enhances model capacity through sparse\nactivation, but faces two major difficulties in practical deployment: (1) The\npresence of numerous outliers in activation distributions leads to severe\ndegradation in quantization accuracy for both activations and weights,\nsignificantly impairing inference performance; (2) Under limited memory,\nefficient offloading and collaborative inference of expert modules struggle to\nbalance latency and throughput. To address these issues, this paper proposes an\nefficient MoE edge deployment scheme based on Hessian-Aware Quantization (HAQ)\nand CPU-GPU collaborative inference. First, by introducing smoothed Hessian\nmatrix quantization, we achieve joint 8-bit quantization of activations and\nweights, which significantly alleviates the accuracy loss caused by outliers\nwhile ensuring efficient implementation on mainstream hardware. Second, we\ndesign an expert-level collaborative offloading and inference mechanism, which,\ncombined with expert activation path statistics, enables efficient deployment\nand scheduling of expert modules between CPU and GPU, greatly reducing memory\nfootprint and inference latency.

As a stepping stone, we study when a gradient flow on a\nhigh-dimensional variable $\\theta$ implies an intrinsic gradient flow on a\nlower-dimensional variable $z = \\phi(\\theta)$, for an architecture-related\nfunction $\\phi$. We express a so-called intrinsic dynamic property and show how\nit is related to the study of conservation laws associated with the\nfactorization $\\phi$. This leads to a simple criterion based on the inclusion\nof kernels of linear maps which yields a necessary condition for this property\nto hold. We then apply our theory to general ReLU networks of arbitrary depth\nand show that, for any initialization, it is possible to rewrite the flow as an\nintrinsic dynamic in a lower dimension that depends only on $z$ and the\ninitialization, when $\\phi$ is the so-called path-lifting. In the case of\nlinear networks with $\\phi$ the product of weight matrices, so-called balanced\ninitializations are also known to enable such a dimensionality reduction; we\ngeneralize this result to a broader class of {\\em relaxed balanced}\ninitializations, showing that, in certain configurations, these are the\n\\emph{only} initializations that ensure the intrinsic dynamic property.\nFinally, for the linear neural ODE associated with the limit of infinitely deep\nlinear networks, with relaxed balanced initialization, we explicitly express\nthe corresponding intrinsic dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u80fd\u5426\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5305\u542b\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7f29\u51cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u5373\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53d8\u91cf\u03b8\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u662f\u5426\u9690\u542b\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53d8\u91cfz=\u03c6(\u03b8)\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u5305\u542b\u7684\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eReLU\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684ReLU\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8ez\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u653e\u5bbd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u79cd\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

This thesis investigates how\nuncertainty estimation can enhance the safety and trustworthiness of ML,\nfocusing on selective prediction -- where models abstain when confidence is\nlow.\n  We first show that a model's training trajectory contains rich uncertainty\nsignals that can be exploited without altering its architecture or loss. By\nensembling predictions from intermediate checkpoints, we propose a lightweight,\npost-hoc abstention method that works across tasks, avoids the cost of deep\nensembles, and achieves state-of-the-art selective prediction performance.\nCrucially, this approach is fully compatible with differential privacy (DP),\nallowing us to study how privacy noise affects uncertainty quality. We find\nthat while many methods degrade under DP, our trajectory-based approach remains\nrobust, and we introduce a framework for isolating the privacy-uncertainty\ntrade-off. Next, we then develop a finite-sample decomposition of the selective\nclassification gap -- the deviation from the oracle accuracy-coverage curve --\nidentifying five interpretable error sources and clarifying which interventions\ncan close the gap. This explains why calibration alone cannot fix ranking\nerrors, motivating methods that improve uncertainty ordering. Finally, we show\nthat uncertainty signals can be adversarially manipulated to hide errors or\ndeny service while maintaining high accuracy, and we design defenses combining\ncalibration audits with verifiable inference.\n  Together, these contributions advance reliable ML by improving, evaluating,\nand safeguarding uncertainty estimation, enabling models that not only make\naccurate predictions -- but also know when to say \"I do not know\".", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u540e\u9a8c\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5f03\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b3. \u5206\u89e3\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u573a\u666f\uff1b2. \u660e\u786e\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e94\u79cd\u6765\u6e90\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f03\u6743\u3002"}}

Although there are already many\nexcellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are\nstill many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to\nincomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth\nanalysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow\nfrom data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long\nCoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies\nfor each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a\nsmall number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large\nnumber of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better\nresults without accuracy filtering.

The\nfaithfulness issue undermines the reliability and practical utility of\nattribution explanations. We argue that these concerns stem from three core\nchallenges. First, difficulties arise in comparing attribution methods due to\ntheir unstructured heterogeneity, differences in heuristics, formulations, and\nimplementations that lack a unified organization. Second, most methods lack\nsolid theoretical underpinnings, with their rationales remaining absent,\nambiguous, or unverified. Third, empirically evaluating faithfulness is\nchallenging without ground truth. Recent theoretical advances provide a\npromising way to tackle these challenges, attracting increasing attention.

MFA replaces discrete data with continuous\npiecewise smooth functions.

While\ncollecting fine-grained, aspect-specific preference data is more reliable and\nscalable, existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) struggle\nwith the severe noise and conflicts inherent in such aggregated datasets. In\nthis paper, we tackle this challenge from a data-centric perspective. We first\nderive the Direct Multi-Preference Optimization (DMPO) objective, and uncover a\nkey Preference Divergence (PD) term that quantifies inter-aspect preference\nconflicts. Instead of using this term for direct optimization, we leverage it\nto formulate a novel, theoretically-grounded data selection principle. Our\nprinciple advocates for selecting a subset of high-consensus data-identified by\nthe most negative PD values-for efficient DPO training. We prove the optimality\nof this strategy by analyzing the loss bounds of the DMPO objective in the\nselection problem. To operationalize our approach, we introduce practical\nmethods of PD term estimation and length bias mitigation, thereby proposing our\nPD selection method.

AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series\nEncoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a\nCross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data\nand textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture\nenables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,\nanomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single\nend-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms\nexisting methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.\nFurthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation\nsummaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent\nand efficient maritime traffic management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAIS-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217AIS\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8239\u8236\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u4e8b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8003\u8651\u590d\u6742\u6d77\u4e8b\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "AIS-LLM\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001LLM\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAIS-LLM\u5728\u5404\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7efc\u5408\u6d77\u4e8b\u60c5\u51b5\u7b80\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "AIS-LLM\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6d77\u4e8b\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Caching inference responses, allowing them to be\nretrieved without another forward pass through the LLM, has emerged as one\npossible solution. Traditional exact-match caching, however, overlooks the\nsemantic similarity between queries, leading to unnecessary recomputation.\nSemantic caching addresses this by retrieving responses based on semantic\nsimilarity, but introduces a fundamentally different cache eviction problem:\none must account for mismatch costs between incoming queries and cached\nresponses. Moreover, key system parameters, such as query arrival probabilities\nand serving costs, are often unknown and must be learned over time. Existing\nsemantic caching methods are largely ad-hoc, lacking theoretical foundations\nand unable to adapt to real-world uncertainty. In this paper, we present a\nprincipled, learning-based framework for semantic cache eviction under unknown\nquery and cost distributions.

To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative\nAlignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective\nstrengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample\ngeneration strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward\nfeedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging\nintra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates\nguided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes\nGRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over\nconventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human\nalignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving\n57.70\\%,17.65\\% 7.95\\% and 5.18\\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and\nGRPO baselines respectively.

However, current alignment methods, primarily based on RLHF,\noptimize LLMs toward a single reward function, resulting in rigid behavior that\nfails to capture the complexity and diversity of human preferences. This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages.

However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard\nproblems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing\nexploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for\ndistillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or\nrestricts reasoning improvement through exploration.\n  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on\ntwo-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the\nexploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then\ngradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way.

The novelty lies in leveraging channel\ninformation in the learning algorithms, eliminating hence the need for\nadditional resources to acquire channel state information (CSI) and to remove\nits impact, as well as in considering asynchronous devices. We provide a\nrigorous analytical framework for the two methods, deriving convergence\nguarantees and establishing appropriate performance bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u901a\u4fe1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u8d1f\u62c5\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4e24\u70b9\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u989d\u5916\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08CSI\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86FL\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6b65\u8bbe\u5907\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Simulating students' memory states is a\npromising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of\nknowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:\nencoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests\nduring the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,\nundifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as\nwell as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes\nmemoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational\nautoencoder.

We implement privacy-preserving global\nnormalization and propose a Random Subset Aggregation strategy, where each\nclient trains on a fixed-size random subset of its data per round, ensuring\nequal contribution during aggregation. Our results show that locally trained\nmodels fail to generalize across sites, and standard weighted FedAvg yields\nhighly skewed performance (e.g., 89.0% accuracy on CHB-MIT but only 50.8% on\nHelsinki and 50.6% on NCH). In contrast, Random Subset Aggregation\nsignificantly improves performance on under-represented clients (accuracy\nincreases to 81.7% on Helsinki and 68.7% on NCH) and achieves a superior\nmacro-average accuracy of 77.1% and pooled accuracy of 80.0% across all sites,\ndemonstrating a more robust and fair global model. This work highlights the\npotential of balanced FL approaches for building effective and generalizable\nseizure prediction systems in realistic, heterogeneous multi-hospital\nenvironments while respecting data privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u96c6\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff08\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8de8\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ad9\u70b9\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u96c6\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fa\u5b9a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u5e73\u7b49\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u96c6\u805a\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u8d6b\u5c14\u8f9b\u57fa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f381.7%\uff0cNCH\u63d0\u5347\u81f368.7%\uff09\uff0c\u5168\u5c40\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe77.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u591a\u533b\u9662\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u766b\u75eb\u53d1\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}
