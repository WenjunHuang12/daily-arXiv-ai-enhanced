In effect, such architectures state how the database records and\nlinks (e.g., foreign-key references) translate into a large, complex numerical\nexpression, involving numerous learnable parameters. This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on. We investigate the realization of the framework in the case\nof hetero-GNNs. We develop heuristic algorithms that avoid the exhaustive\nsearch over the space of all databases. We propose techniques that are\nmodel-agnostic, and others that are tailored to hetero-GNNs via the notion of\nlearnable masking. Our approach is evaluated through an extensive empirical\nstudy on the RelBench collection, covering a variety of domains and different\nrecord-level tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed\nexplanations, as well as the efficiency of their generation."}

This setting is\nparticularly relevant when some agents exhibit extreme or atypical preferences.\nAs a natural case study, we consider facility location on the line: $n$\nstrategic agents report their preferred locations, and a mechanism places a\nfacility to minimize a social cost function. In our setting, the $z$ agents\nfarthest from the chosen facility are excluded from the social cost. While it\nmay seem intuitive that discarding outliers improves efficiency, our results\nreveal that the opposite can hold.\n  We derive tight bounds for deterministic strategyproof mechanisms under the\ntwo most-studied objectives: utilitarian and egalitarian social cost. Our\nresults offer a comprehensive view of the impact of outliers. We first show\nthat when $z \\ge n/2$, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve a bounded\napproximation for either objective. For egalitarian cost, selecting the $(z +\n1)$-th order statistic is strategyproof and 2-approximate. In fact, we show\nthat this is best possible by providing a matching lower bound. Notably, this\nlower bound of 2 persists even when the mechanism has access to a prediction of\nthe optimal location, in stark contrast to the setting without outliers. For\nutilitarian cost, we show that strategyproof mechanisms cannot effectively\nexploit outliers, leading to the counterintuitive outcome that approximation\nguarantees worsen as the number of outliers increases. However, in this case,\naccess to a prediction allows us to design a strategyproof mechanism achieving\nthe best possible trade-off between consistency and robustness. Finally, we\nalso establish lower bounds for randomized mechanisms that are truthful in\nexpectation."}

This shift\nto a mainly synthetic content presents a critical challenge: repeated training\nin synthetic data leads to a phenomenon known as model collapse, where model\nperformance degrades over generations of training, eventually rendering the\nmodels ineffective. Although prior studies have explored the causes and\ndetection of model collapse, existing mitigation strategies remain limited.\n  In this paper, we identify model overconfidence in their self-generated data\nas a key driver of collapse.

However, adapting LLMs from general-purpose models to\nspecialized tasks remains challenging, particularly in resource-constrained\nenvironments. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a prominent method within\nParameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), has emerged as a promising approach to\nLLMs by approximating model weight updates using low-rank decomposition.\nHowever, LoRA is limited by its uniform rank ( r ) allocation to each\nincremental matrix, and existing rank allocation techniques aimed at addressing\nthis issue remain computationally inefficient, complex, and unstable, hindering\npractical applications. To address these limitations, we propose\nSensitivity-LoRA, an efficient fine-tuning method that dynamically allocates\nranks to weight matrices based on both their global and local sensitivities. It\nleverages the second-order derivatives (Hessian Matrix) of the loss function to\neffectively capture weight sensitivity, enabling optimal rank allocation with\nminimal computational overhead. Our experimental results have demonstrated\nrobust effectiveness, efficiency and stability of Sensitivity-LoRA across\ndiverse tasks and benchmarks."}

Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered\nin the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located,\nsynchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily\non coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal\ndynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over\ntime. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in\nrole-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive\nstrategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support\nsystems."}

To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa.

This complexity makes it\nhard to explain, in human-understandable terms, how a model uses the available\ndata to arrive at a given prediction. We present a novel framework for\nexplaining machine-learning models over relational databases, where\nexplanations are view definitions that highlight focused parts of the database\nthat mostly contribute to the model's prediction. We establish such global\nabductive explanations by adapting the classic notion of determinacy by Nash,\nSegoufin, and Vianu (2010). In addition to tuning the tradeoff between\ndeterminacy and conciseness, the framework allows controlling the level of\ngranularity by adopting different fragments of view definitions, such as ones\nhighlighting whole columns, foreign keys between tables, relevant groups of\ntuples, and so on.
