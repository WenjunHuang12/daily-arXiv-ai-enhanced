This paper is the first to introduce a sublinear-time\nalgorithm for counting squares in the packed setting. The packed representation\nof a string of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\\sigma$ is given as a\nsequence of $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ machine words in the word-RAM model (a machine\nword consists of $\\omega \\ge \\log_2 n$ bits). Previously, it was known how to\ncount distinct squares in $O(n)$ time [Gusfield and Stoye, JCSS 2004], even for\na string over an integer alphabet [Crochemore et al., TCS 2014; Bannai et al.,\nCPM 2017; Charalampopoulos et al., SPIRE 2020]. We use the techniques for\nextracting squares from runs described by Crochemore et al. [TCS 2014].\nHowever, the packed model requires novel approaches.\n  We need an $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$-sized representation of all long-period runs\n(runs with period $\\Omega(\\log_\\sigma n)$) which allows for a sublinear-time\ncounting of the -- potentially linearly-many -- implied squares. The\nlong-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer\nruns) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\\Omega(n)$. The number of all\nother long-period runs is $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ and we can construct an implicit\nrepresentation of all long-period runs in $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$ time by\nleveraging the insights of Amir et al. [ESA 2019]. We count squares in layer\nruns by exploiting combinatorial properties of pyramidally-shaped groups of\nlayer runs. Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots\nof runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate\nequal squares. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce sparse-Lyndon roots\nwhich are based on string synchronizers [Kempa and Kociumaka, STOC 2019]."}

To achieve robust performance in\nmissing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i)\ncross-modal preference invariance, which ensures consistent user preference\nmodeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective\nmodality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information\nwhile maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By\ntreating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs\ninvariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item\nrepresentations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module grounded in the\nInformation Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item\nembeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference\nsignals. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nMRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its\neffectiveness and robustness in practical applications.

We address three\nresearch questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader\ndisagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it\nsensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on\nthe ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater\ndisagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks\nrequiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an\ninterpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy\nAI-assisted grading workflows."}

Accurate classification of\nsoil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts\nagricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate\nresilience. In this work, we propose $\\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal\nmultitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized\npipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first\npredict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.\nEach segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological\nfeatures.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict\nhierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for\neach recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE\nincorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space\noverlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but\nalso promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive\nutilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled\nIDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models.

To bridge this evaluation chasm,\nwe introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,\nbut to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the\nfull sensory spectrum.

This leads to\nexcessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical\ndeployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory\nmechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their\nreasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To\naddress this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),\nwhich explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and\ncontrol components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control\nstrategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction\nmechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and\ndelegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling\nthe construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a\nstructured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial\nmeta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment\nPolicy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control\nbehavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.\nExperiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained\nwith MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy."}

Existing methods\nfocus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized\npolicies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric\ndivergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur\nnumerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of\n$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained\nwith a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be\ndecomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding\nthe latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric\n$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric\ndivergences.

Recently, the\nintroduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging\nrule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions\nand guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across\nmany replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses\nunder a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or\nincorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to\nvanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for\nlearning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.\nTo address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization\nframework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome\nconsistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs\nshow high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives\nmeaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and\nself-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective.

Recently, generative recommendation\nhas emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional\nretrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic\ngeneration. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained\nby their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from\ntwo critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking\na coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement\n(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that\nlearns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core\ninnovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization\nprocess that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more\nuniform and disentangled IDs.

Unfortunately, such\napproaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting\ntransmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume\nof traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,\nmaking the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for\nfederated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).\nUnlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client\ncommunication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate\npredictions using only local information.
