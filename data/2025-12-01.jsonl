We present a minimal repeated auction model that yields a simple incentive compatibility condition and a closed form threshold for sustainable collusion for subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. In controlled simulations with multiple language models, we observe systematic supra-competitive prices in small auction settings and a return to competitive behavior as the number of bidders in the market increases, consistent with the theoretical model. We also find LLMs use various mechanisms to facilitate tacit coordination, such as focal point acceptance timing versus patient strategies that track the theoretical incentives. The results provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence of bidder side tacit collusion by LLMs and show that market structure levers can be more effective than capability limits for mitigation."}

Plotkin"], "title": "The Evolution of Trust under Institutional Moral Hazard", "comment": "26 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We study the behavior of for-profit institutions that broadcast reputations to foster trust among market participants. We develop a theoretical model in which buyers and sellers are matched on a platform to engage in transactions involving a moral hazard: sellers can either faithfully deliver goods after receiving payment, or not. Although the buyer does not know a seller's true type, the platform maintains a reputation system that probabilistically assigns binary reputation signals. Buyers make purchase decisions based on reputation signals, which influence the payoffs to sellers who then adapt their type over time. These market dynamics ultimately shape the platform's profit from commissions on sales. Our analysis reveals that platforms inherently have an incentive for rating inflation, driven by the desire to increase commission. This introduces a second layer of moral hazard: the platform's incentive to distort reputations for its own profit. Such distortion is self-limited by the platform's need to maintain enough accuracy that trustworthy sellers remain in the market, without which rational buyers would refrain from purchases altogether. Nonetheless, the optimal strategy for the platform can be to invest in order to reduce signal accuracy. When the platform can freely set commission fees, however, maximum profit may be achieved by costly investment in an accurate reputation system. These findings highlight the intricate tensions between platform incentives and resulting social utility for marketplace participants."}

While existing research emphasizes the adherence of AI to honest ethical principles, it overlooks the potential benefits of benevolent deception, which maximize overall payoffs. This study proposes a game-theoretic model for lane-changing scenarios, incorporating Bayesian inference to capture dynamic changes in human trust during interactions under external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) disclosed information. Case studies reveal that benevolent deception can enhance the efficiency of interaction in up to 59.4% of scenarios and improve safety in up to 52.7%. However, in the most pronounced cases, deception also led to trust collapse in up to 36.9% of drivers, exposing a critical vulnerability in the ethical design of ADS. The findings suggest that aligning ADS with comprehensive human ethical values, including the conditional use of benevolent deception, can enhance human-machine interaction. Additionally, the risk of trust collapse remains a major ethical loophole that must be addressed in future ADS development."}

These strengths present new opportunities to enhance traditional recommendation systems (RS), especially in the cold-start item scenario where newly introduced items lack interactions. Existing works have used LLMs to address cold-start issues in traditional RS through data augmentation, but they have limitations. One recent work directly addresses this issue by prompting LLMs to generate augmented interaction data between randomly sampled users and cold-start items. Then, they train the traditional RS with augmented data, incorporating collaborative signals for cold-start items. Although they use LLMs to provide cold-start items with feedback, they use partial user histories, which does not allow the LLM to fully emulate the user. Furthermore, randomly selecting users is not optimal for augmentation. To address these challenges, we leverage the LLM as a user and develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains a policy to select users for augmentation, optimizing for cold-start item performance after augmented training. The policy model learns to select users for cold-start item data augmentation based on their behavioral features and histories. To optimize user selection for cold-start item performance, we employ a policy gradient method that updates the policy in the direction of actions that lead to high rewards. Experiments on Amazon Product Review datasets show substantial gains in cold-start item recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method as a scalable, serving-efficient augmentation strategy for modern RS."}

Their exact computation, however, is intractable because it requires aggregating marginal contributions over exponentially many permutations or subsets. While sampling-based estimators have been studied in cooperative game theory, their direct use for relational query answering remains underexplored and often ignores the structure of schemas and joins.\n  We study tuple-level attribution for relational queries through sampling and introduce Relation-Stratified Sampling (RSS). Instead of stratifying coalitions only by size, RSS partitions the sample space by a relation-wise count vector that records how many tuples are drawn from each relation. This join-aware stratification concentrates samples on structurally valid and informative coalitions and avoids strata that cannot satisfy query conditions. We further develop an adaptive variant, ARSS, that reallocates budget across strata using variance estimates obtained during sampling, improving estimator efficiency without increasing the total number of samples. We analyze these estimators, describe a practical implementation that reuses compiled views to reduce per-sample query cost, and evaluate them on TPCH workloads.\n  Across diverse queries with multi-relation joins and aggregates, RSS and ARSS consistently outperform classical Monte Carlo (MCS) and size-based Stratified Sampling (SS), yielding lower error and variance with fewer samples. An ablation shows that relation-aware stratification and adaptive allocation contribute complementary gains, making ARSS a simple, effective, and anytime estimator for database-centric Shapley attribution."}

However, despite its popularity, DP imposes strict requirements which guard against strong worst-case scenarios. For example, it guards against seemingly unrealistic scenarios where an attacker has full information about all but one point in the data set, and still nothing can be learned about the remaining point. While preventing such a strong attack is desirable, many works have explored whether average-case relaxations of DP are easier to satisfy [HWR13,WLF16,BF16,LWX23].\n  In this work, we are motivated by the question of whether alternate, weaker notions of privacy are possible: can a weakened privacy notion still guarantee some basic level of privacy, and on the other hand, achieve privacy more efficiently and/or for a substantially broader set of tasks? Our main result shows the answer is no: even in the statistical setting, any reasonable measure of privacy satisfying nontrivial composition is equivalent to DP. To prove this, we identify a core set of four axioms or desiderata: pre-processing invariance, prohibition of blatant non-privacy, strong composition, and linear scalability. Our main theorem shows that any privacy measure satisfying our axioms is equivalent to DP, up to polynomial factors in sample complexity. We complement this result by showing our axioms are minimal: removing any one of our axioms enables ill-behaved measures of privacy."}

Recent studies indicate that distributed databases exhibit significantly higher latency than single-node databases, primarily due to consensus protocols maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes. We argue that synchronization cost constitutes the primary bottleneck for distributed databases, which is particularly pronounced in wide-area networks (WAN). Fortunately, we identify opportunities to optimize synchronization costs in real production environments: (1) network clustering phenomena, (2) triangle inequality violations in transmission, and (3) redundant data transfers. Based on these observations, we propose GeoCoCo, a synchronization acceleration framework for cross-region distributed databases. First, GeoCoCo presents a group rescheduling strategy that adapts to real-time network conditions to maximize WAN transmission efficiency. Second, GeoCoCo introduces a task-preserving data filtering method that reduces data volume transmitted over the WAN. Finally, GeoCoCo develops a consistency-guaranteed transmission framework integrating grouping and pruning. Extensive evaluations in both trace-driven simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GeoCoCo reduces synchronization cost-primarily by lowering WAN bandwidth usage-by up to 40.3%, and increases system throughput by up to 14.1% in GeoGauss."}

These bubble-like structures underpin key tasks in computational pangenomics, including structural-variant genotyping, distance indexing, haplotype sampling, and variant annotation. Snarls can be quadratically-many in the size of the graph, and since their introduction in 2018 with the vg toolkit, there has been no work on identifying all snarls in linear time. Moreover, while it is known how to find superbubbles in linear time, this result is a highly specialized solution only achieved after a long series of papers.\n  We present the first algorithm identifying all snarls in linear time. This is based on a new representation of all snarls, of size linear in the input graph size, and which can be computed in linear time. Our algorithm is based on a unified framework that also provides a new linear-time algorithm for finding superbubbles. An observation behind our results is that all such structures are separated from the rest of the graph by two vertices (except for cases which are trivially computable), i.e. their endpoints are a 2-separator of the underlying undirected graph. Based on this, we employ the well-known SPQR tree decomposition, which encodes all 2-separators, to guide a traversal that finds the bubble-like structures efficiently.\n  We implemented our algorithms in C++ (available at https://github.com/algbio/BubbleFinder) and evaluated them on various pangenomic datasets. Our algorithms outcompete or they are on the same level of existing methods. For snarls, we are up to two times faster than vg, while identifying all snarls.

Our contribution lies in establishing a rigorous methodology for characterizing system reliability under diverse propagation environments. Closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER) are derived by employing a tractable eigenvalue-based approximation of the spatially correlated UAV-to-user link, whose underlying independent diversity components are modeled as Nakagami-$m$ fading. This approach addresses both line-of-sight (LoS) dominant rural and probabilistic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban scenarios. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is developed, revealing the fundamental diversity order of the UAV-to-user link. Based on this, we further address the practical issue of energy efficiency. A realistic energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, which explicitly accounts for the time and energy overhead inherent in the FAS port selection process, a factor often omitted in idealized models. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the key system parameters. Extensive numerical results validate the analysis and illustrate that while FASs can yield substantial power gains, the operational overhead introduces a non-trivial trade-off. This trade-off leads to an optimal number of ports and fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies in rural versus urban environments.

There is an elegant generalization of this theorem by Monderer and Samet, later refined by Neeman: if a group of agents share a common prior, update their beliefs using Bayesian conditioning on private information, and have common p-belief of their posteriors, these posteriors must be close (i.e., they cannot differ by more than 1 - p). Here, common p-belief generalizes the concept of common knowledge to probabilistic beliefs: agents commonly p-believe an event E if everyone believes E to at least degree p, everyone believes to at least degree p that everyone believes E to at least degree p, and so on.\n  This paper further extends the Monderer-Samet-Neeman Agreement Theorem from classical probability measures to plausibility measures -- a very general framework introduced by Halpern that unifies many formal models of belief. To facilitate this extension, we provide a new proof of the Monderer-Samet-Neeman theorem in the classical setting. Building upon both the original proof and our new proof, we offer two different generalizations of the theorem to plausibility-based structures.\n  We then apply these generalized results to several non-classical belief models, including conditional probability structures and lexicographic probability structures.

In this work, we investigate how to enhance LLM-based entity matching by decomposing the matching process into multiple explicit reasoning stages. We propose a three-step framework that first identifies matched and unmatched tokens between two records, then determines the attributes most influential to the matching decision, and finally predicts whether the records refer to the same real-world entity.

With only 5,000 training samples - from LlavaSCo for CIR and Training-Sketchy for SBIR - our method achieves competitive results across benchmarks, including CIRCO mAP@50 of 38.5 and Sketchy mAP@200 of 82.7, surpassing many heavily supervised baselines. This demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of UNION in bridging vision and language across diverse query types."}

Existing audio-video generation pipelines typically decompose the task into cascaded stages, which accumulate errors across modalities and are trained under separate objectives. Recent joint audio-video generators alleviate this issue but often rely on dual-tower architectures with ad-hoc cross-modal bridges and static, single-shot text conditioning, making it difficult to both reuse T2V backbones and to reason about how audio, video and language interact over time. To address these challenges, we propose 3MDiT, a unified tri-modal diffusion transformer for text-driven synchronized audio-video generation. Our framework models video, audio and text as jointly evolving streams: an isomorphic audio branch mirrors a T2V backbone, tri-modal omni-blocks perform feature-level fusion across the three modalities, and an optional dynamic text conditioning mechanism updates the text representation as audio and video evidence co-evolve. The design supports two regimes: training from scratch on audio-video data, and orthogonally adapting a pretrained T2V model without modifying its backbone. Experiments show that our approach generates high-quality videos and realistic audio while consistently improving audio-video synchronization and tri-modal alignment across a range of quantitative metrics."}

However, existing algorithms are not specially designed for per-key estimation centered at one point. They cannot achieve high accuracy in our problem setting, and their throughput are not satisfactory to handle high-speed items in data streams. To solve this problem, we propose MagnifierSketch for point-quantile estimation. MagnifierSketch supports both single-key and per-key quantile estimation, and its key techniques are named Value Focus, Distribution Calibration and Double Filtration. We provide strict mathematical derivations to prove the unbiasedness of MagnifierSketch and show its space and time complexity. Our experimental results show that the Average Error (AE) of MagnifierSketch is significantly lower than the state-of-the-art in both single-key and per-key situations.

The current state-of-the-art shows the difficulty of implementing practical IRS designs able to redirect large signal bandwidths, prone to the so-called beam split (BS) dispersion effect. In this work, we propose two highly efficient configuration techniques, adapted to ultrawideband downlink scenarios, based on localized optimization over the IRS surface. Such techniques exploit the BS effect while taking into account for the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum. Simulations considering different geometrical setups and different signal spectra show how the proposed techniques are able to guarantee an increased signal power at the receiver with respect to classical narrowband-based solutions or techniques that perform a global optimization over the entire IRS surface."}

Through an analysis of the axiomatic properties of SkS and of its vulnerability to manipulative and electoral control attacks, we compare SkS with Bucklin voting and provide insights into its potential strengths and weaknesses. In particular, we show that SkS satisfies nondictatorship as well as the majority criterion, positive responsiveness, monotonicity, and citizens' sovereignty but violates the Condorcet criterion, strong monotonicity, independence of clones, consistency, participation, resoluteness, and strategy-proofness. Further, we study manipulation, i.e., where (groups of) voters vote strategically to improve the outcome of an election in their favor, showing that the constructive coalitional weighted manipulation problem for SkS is NP-complete, while the destructive variant can be solved in polynomial time. Lastly, we initiate the study of electoral control, where an external agent attempts to change the election outcome by interfering with the structure of the election.

Serial Safety Net (SSN) offers a lightweight commit-time test but is conservative and effectively anchored on commit time as the sole point. We present ESSN, a principled generalization of SSN that relaxes the exclusion condition to allow more transactions to commit safely, and we prove that this preserves multiversion serializability (MVSR) and that it strictly subsumes SSN. ESSN states an MVSG (Multiversion Serialization Graph)-based criterion and introduces a known total order over transactions (KTO; e.g., begin-ordered or commit-ordered) for reasoning about the graph's serializability. With a single commit-time check under invariant-based semantics, ESSN's exclusion condition preserves monotonicity along per-item version chains, and eliminates chain traversal. The protocol is Direct Serialization Graph (DSG)-based with commit-time work linear in the number of reads and writes, matching SSN's per-version footprint. We also make mixed workloads explicit by defining a Long transaction via strict interval containment of Short transactions, and we evaluate ESSN on reproducible workloads. Under a commit-ordered KTO, using begin-snapshot reads reduces the long-transaction abort rate by up to approximately 0.25 absolute (about 50% relative) compared with SSN."}

Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics."}

Increasingly, we also see the emergence of algorithmic Pareto frontiers, where getting better asymptotic time complexity for a problem requires getting worse asymptotic space complexity, and vice-versa.

The key novelty is the notion of c-strong belief, a non-standard, \"cautious\" version of strong belief (Battigalli and Siniscalchi 2002, JET). Our formulation of prudent rationalizability embodies a \"best rationalization principle\" similar to the one that underlies the solution concept of strong rationalizability.

However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation.

Existing MERC approaches predominantly focus on cross-modal shared features, often overlooking modality-specific features that capture subtle yet critical emotional cues such as micro-expressions, prosodic variations, and sarcasm. Although related work in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has explored disentangling shared and modality-specific features, these methods typically employ rigid orthogonal constraints to achieve full disentanglement, which neglects the inherent complementarity between feature types and may limit recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose Angle-Optimized Feature Learning (AO-FL), a framework tailored for MERC that achieves partial disentanglement of shared and specific features within each modality through adaptive angular optimization. Specifically, AO-FL aligns shared features across modalities to ensure semantic consistency, and within each modality it adaptively models the angular relationship between its shared and modality-specific features to preserve both distinctiveness and complementarity. An orthogonal projection refinement further removes redundancy in specific features and enriches shared features with contextual information, yielding more discriminative multimodal representations. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AO-FL for MERC, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, AO-FL can be seamlessly integrated with various unimodal feature extractors and extended to other multimodal fusion tasks, such as MER, thereby highlighting its strong generalization beyond MERC."}

Since both narrow-beam and broad-beam patterns are essential in practical communication networks, enabling flexible beamforming through fluid antennas becomes an important and interesting research direction. We establish a unified and flexible framework that connects arbitrary beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection.

Given a graph $G$ and a vertex set $X \\subseteq V(G)$, consider the collection of subsets of the form $N(u) \\cap X$ where $u$ ranges over all vertices outside $X$. These intersections, which we call the traces of $X$, capture all ways vertices in $G$ connect to $X$, and in this paper we consider the problem of listing these traces efficiently, and the related problem of recording the multiplicity (frequency) of each trace. For a given query set $X$, both problems have obvious algorithms with running time $O(|N(X)| \\cdot |X|)$ and conditional lower bounds suggest that, on general graphs, one cannot expect better. However, in certain sparse graph classes, more efficient algorithms are possible: Drange \\etal (IPEC 2023) used a data structure that answers trace queries in $d$-degenerate graphs with linear initialisation time and query time that only depends on the query set $X$ and $d$. However, the query time is exponential in $|X|$, which makes this approach impractical. By using a stronger parameter than degeneracy, namely the strong $2$-colouring number $s_2$, we construct a data structure in $O(d \\cdot \\|G\\|)$ time, which answers subsequent trace frequency queries in time $O\\big((d^2 + s_2^{d+2})|X|\\big)$, where $\\|G\\|$ is the number of edges of $G$, $s_2$ is the strong $2$-colouring number and $d$ the degeneracy of a suitable ordering of $G$. We demonstrate that this data structure is indeed practical and that it beats the simple, obvious alternative in almost all tested settings, using a collection of 217 real-world networks with up to 1.1M edges. As part of this effort, we demonstrate that computing an ordering with a small strong $2$-colouring number is feasible with a simple heuristic."}

Additionally, we present the Moore determinant formula for CM$(t)$s and a sufficient condition to avoid $4$-cycles in CM\\((t)\\)-QC LDPC codes' Tanner graphs for $t> 1$. We also point out the non-existence of binary block MDS CPM-QC LDPC codes. Compared to the codes constructed in [Li {\\it et al. }IEEE TIT, 2023] and [Xiao {\\it et al. }IEEE TCOM, 2021], our block MDS LDPC codes show enhanced random-error-correction at a similar code length and rate. Meanwhile, these codes can effectively combat burst errors when considered as array codes. Both of our two types of constructions for block MDS LDPC codes are applicable to the scenario of the binary field."}

Ad items are determined through an advertising auction system, while organic items are selected by a recommendation system. These systems have distinct optimization objectives, creating the challenge of effectively merging these two components. Recent research has explored merging mechanisms for e-commerce platforms, but none have simultaneously achieved all desirable properties: incentive compatibility, individual rationality, adaptability to multiple slots, integration of inseparable candidates, and avoidance of repeated exposure for ads and organic items. This paper addresses the design of a merging mechanism that satisfies all these properties. We first provide the necessary conditions for the optimal merging mechanisms. Next, we introduce two simple and effective mechanisms, termed the generalized fix mechanism and the generalized change mechanism. Finally, we theoretically prove that both mechanisms offer guaranteed approximation ratios compared to the optimal mechanism in both simplest and general settings."}

In this paper, we focus on user-level FedRecs, which is a more practical yet challenging setting compared to group-level FedRecs. Adversarial training emerges as the most feasible approach within this context. We identify two key challenges in implementing adversarial training-based attribute unlearning for user-level FedRecs: i) mitigating training instability caused by user data heterogeneity, and ii) preventing attribute information leakage through gradients. To address these challenges, we propose FedAU2, an attribute unlearning method for user-level FedRecs. For CH1, we propose an adaptive adversarial training strategy, where the training dynamics are adjusted in response to local optimization behavior. For CH2, we propose a dual-stochastic variational autoencoder to perturb the adversarial model, effectively preventing gradient-based information leakage. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FedAU2 achieves superior performance in unlearning effectiveness and recommendation performance compared to existing baselines."}

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive multicultural analysis of story visualization using current text-to-image models across multilingual settings on two datasets: FlintstonesSV and VIST. To assess cultural dimensions rigorously, we propose a Progressive Multicultural Evaluation Framework and introduce five story visualization metrics, Cultural Appropriateness, Visual Aesthetics, Cohesion, Semantic Consistency, and Object Presence, that are not addressed by existing metrics. We further automate assessment through an MLLM-as-Jury framework that approximates human judgment. Human evaluations show that models generate more coherent, visually appealing, and culturally appropriate stories for real-world datasets than for animated ones. The generated stories exhibit a stronger alignment with English-speaking cultures across all metrics except Cohesion, where Chinese performs better. In contrast, Hindi ranks lowest on all metrics except Visual Aesthetics, reflecting real-world cultural biases embedded in current models. This multicultural analysis provides a foundation for future research aimed at generating culturally appropriate and inclusive visual stories across diverse linguistic and cultural settings."}

The \\emph{temporal exploration problem} asks for the length of the shortest sequence of vertices that starts at a given vertex, visits every vertex, and at each time step $t$ either stays at the current vertex or moves to an adjacent vertex in $G_t$. Bounds on the length of a shortest temporal exploration have been investigated extensively. Perhaps the most fundamental case is when each graph $G_t$ is connected and has bounded maximum degree. In this setting, Erlebach, Kammer, Luo, Sajenko, and Spooner [ICALP 2019] showed that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{7/4})$ time steps. We significantly improve this bound by showing that $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\log n})$ time steps suffice.\n  In fact, we deduce this result from a much more general statement. Let the \\emph{average temporal maximum degree} $D$ of $G$ be the average of $\\max_{t \\in I} d_{G_t}(v)$ over all vertices $v \\in V(G)$, where $d_{G_t}(v)$ denotes the degree of $v$ in $G_t$. If each graph $G_t$ is connected, we show that there exists an exploration of $G$ in $\\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2} \\sqrt{D \\log n})$ time steps. In particular, this gives the first subquadratic upper bound when the underlying graph has bounded average degree. As a special case, this also improves the previous best bounds when the underlying graph is planar or has bounded treewidth and provides a unified approach for all of these settings. Our bound is subquadratic already when $D=o(n/\\log n)$."}

To facilitate Bayesian conditioning in such cases, one must therefore extend the probability space so that the new information becomes an event in this expanded space. Skyrms (1985) argues that Bayesian conditioning in an extended probability space on a product space of outcomes aligns precisely with the solution from Maximum Entropy. In contrast, Seidenfeld (1986) uses Friedman and Shimony's (1971) result to criticize Skyrms' approach as trivial, suggesting that alignment holds only under a degenerate probability model. Here, I argue that Friedman and Shimony's result must either (1) be a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach, or (2) pose a universal challenge to any method of extending spaces. Accepting (2) would imply that Bayesian conditioning is incapable of accommodating information beyond the probability space defined on the original outcome space."}

In contrast, textual document retrieval benefits from robust, standardized evaluation via Cranfield-style test collections, which combine pooled relevance judgments with controlled setups. While recent work shows that adapting this methodology to recommender systems is feasible, constructing such collections remains costly due to the need for manual relevance judgments, thus limiting scalability. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as reliable automatic judges to address these scalability challenges. Using the ML-32M-ext Cranfield-style movie recommendation collection, we first examine the limitations of existing evaluation methodologies. Then we explore the alignment and the recommender systems ranking agreement between the LLM-judge and human provided relevance labels. We find that incorporating richer item metadata and longer user histories improves alignment, and that LLM-judge yields high agreement with human-based rankings (Kendall's tau = 0.87). Finally, an industrial case study in the podcast recommendation domain demonstrates the practical value of LLM-judge for model selection. Overall, our results show that LLM-judge is a viable and scalable approach for evaluating recommender systems."}

A fault-tolerant (FT) spanner preserves approximate distances under network failures, often used in applications like network design and distributed systems. While classic (fault-free) spanners are believed to be easily extended to hypergraphs such as by the method of associated graphs, we reveal that this is not the case in the fault-tolerant setting: simple methods can only get a linear size in the maximum number of faults $f$. In contrast, all known optimal size of FT spanners are sublinear in $f$. Inspired by the FT clustering technique, we propose a clustering based algorithm that achieves an improved sublinear size bound. For an $n$-node $m$-edge hypergraph with rank $r$ and a sketch parameter $k$, our algorithm constructs edge FT (EFT) hyperspanners of stretch $2k-1$ and size $O(k^2f^{1-1/(rk)}n^{1+1/k}\\log n)$ with high probability in time $\\widetilde{O}(mr^3+fn)$. We also establish a lower bound of $Ω(f^{1-1/r-1/rk}n^{1+1/k-o(1)})$ edges for EFT hyperspanners, which leaves a gap of poly$(k)f^{1/r}$.

Specifically, we adopt a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization (PASCAL) system, in which multiple drones actively transmit signals towards the base station (BS). Upon receiving the signal, the BS estimates the drones' location parameters to reconstruct the channel matrix, which is then utilized for ZF and MMSE equalization. As the channel matrix is characterized by the estimated parameters associated with the target's location and the matrix inversion involved in ZF and MMSE further complicates the analysis, obtaining a closed-form SER expression becomes intractable. Thus, a tightly approximated SER expression is respectively derived for ZF and MMSE by using a hybrid approximation method incorporating Neumann approximation and Taylor approximation. Our analysis reveals several important design insights: first, the average SER of drone $k$ for both ZF and MMSE can be affected by the localization errors from all drones including drone $k$; second, the average SER of ZF is unaffected by the estimation inaccuracy of range, whereas the average SER of MMSE is influenced by it; third, ZF and MMSE is the most susceptible to the influence of angle estimation errors compared to the other localization errors; fourth, ZF is highly sensitive to localization errors and may be even worse than maximal ratio combining (MRC) under some conditions of significant estimation errors.

Recently, neural network-based decoders have emerged as promising tools for enhancing ECC reliability, yet their high computational complexity prevents their potential practical deployment. In this paper, we take a different approach and design a neural transmission scheme that employs the transformer architecture in order to improve the reliability of existing ECCs. We call this approach TransCoder, alluding both to its function and architecture. TransCoder operates as a code-adaptive neural module aimed at performance enhancement that can be implemented flexibly at either the transmitter, receiver, or both. The framework employs an iterative decoding procedure, where both noisy information from the channel and updates from the conventional ECC decoder are processed by a neural decoder block, utilizing a block attention mechanism for efficiency. Through extensive simulations with various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, and Turbo) and across a wide range of channel conditions, we demonstrate that TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Notably, our approach is particularly effective for longer codes (block length >64) and at lower code rates, scenarios in which existing neural decoders often struggle (despite their formidable computational complexity). The results establish TransCoder as a promising practical solution for reliable communication among resource-constrained wireless devices."}

RCSP has attracted growing interest in theoretical computer science, and when the variable domain is Boolean, the computational complexity of RCSP exhibits a dichotomy depending on the allowed constraint types. A notable special case is the reconfiguration of graph homomorphisms -- also known as graph recoloring -- which has been studied using topological methods. We propose a novel algebraic approach to RCSP, inspired by techniques used in classical CSP complexity analysis. Unlike traditional methods based on total operations, our framework employs partial operations to capture a reduction involving equality constraints. This perspective facilitates the extension of complexity results from Boolean domains to more general settings, demonstrating the versatility of partial operations in identifying tractable RCSP instances."}

More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$.

In contrast to our previous work, here we use the point-wise measure instead of a bounded mutual information, and we assume that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. In this work, we design $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression rate constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \\leq r$.

When $ε$ is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the KL-divergence and mutual information.

For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we obtain lower bounds with low computational complexity.

The cost of serving a request equals the cost of a path from the root to the vertex where the request resides. Instead of serving each request individually, requests can be aggregated and served by transmitting a subtree from the root that spans the vertices on which the requests reside, to potentially be more cost-effective. The aggregated cost is the weight of the transmission subtree. The goal of MLAP-D is to find an aggregation solution that minimizes the total cost while serving all requests.\n  We present improved and parameterized algorithms for MLAP-D. Our result is twofold.

Despite its potential, the practical application of CKM in beam training faces several challenges. On one hand, the user's precise location is typically unavailable prior to beam training, which limits the utility of CKM since its effectiveness relies heavily on accurate input of position data. On the other hand, the intricate interplay among CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies has not been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance and difficulties in practical implementation. In this paper, we present a framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses these limitations. For single-user scenario, we propose a reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy which integrates partial position information and CKM. This strategy models the user equipment (UE) position uncertainty and formulates the hierarchical searching process as a pruned binary search tree. An optimal hierarchical searching strategy with minimal overhead is derived by evaluating the weights and rewards of potential codewords. Furthermore, a low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme is designed to balance overhead and computational demands. For multi-user scenario, we develop a correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme, where sidelobe gains from inter-user interference are exploited to provide additional side information for overhead reduction, allowing all users to be simultaneously assigned their respective supportive beams.

For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes. Accordingly, we present an $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-parity-check matrix for Trombetti-Zhou codes as evaluation codes over an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-basis of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. This relies on the choice of a particular basis called \\emph{trace almost dual basis}. Subsequently, denoting by $d$ the minimum distance of the code, we show that if the rank weight $t$ of the error vector is strictly smaller than $\\frac{d-1}{2}$, the syndrome-based decoding of Trombetti-Zhou codes can be converted to the decoding of Gabidulin codes of dimension one larger. On the other hand, when $t=\\frac{d-1}{2}$, we reduce the decoding to determining the rank of a certain matrix. The complexity of the proposed decoding for Trombetti-Zhou codes is also discussed."}

Traditional approaches that estimate individual component parameters face significant difficulties when the number of components is large, including permutation ambiguity, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. We introduce a novel framework based on low-dimensional sum-parameters that capture essential global characteristics of the signal ensemble. These parameters include the sum of amplitudes, the power-weighted frequency, and the phase-related sum. These quantities possess clear physical interpretations representing total signal strength, power-weighted average frequency, and composite phase information, while completely avoiding permutation ambiguities. We derive exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for these sum-parameters under both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Our analysis reveals that the frequency sumparameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while automatically benefiting from power pooling across all signal components. The proposed Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, significantly outperforming established techniques such as Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Extensive numerical simulations involving 2000 Monte-Carlo trials confirm that EGEM closely approaches the theoretical performance bounds even with relatively small sample sizes of 250 observations."}

In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.\n  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.\n  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied."}

To account for multi-timescale uncertainties arising from user mobility, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and hardware impairments, our approach decouples the long-term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement from the per-slot beamforming design. By employing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a distribution-free risk metric, a low-complexity algorithm is developed, which combines a surrogate model for efficient deployment with an alternating optimization (AO) scheme for robust real-time beamforming. Simulation results validate that the proposed DRO-CVaR framework significantly enhances the tail-end secrecy spectral efficiency and maintains a lower outage probability compared to benchmark schemes, especially under severe uncertainty conditions."}
