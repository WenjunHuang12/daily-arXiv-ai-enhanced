This paper addresses this challenge by deploying\na multilevel diversity coding (MDC) scheme that controls the received\ninformation, offers distinct reliability guarantees based on the priority of\ndata streams, and maintains low design and operational complexity as the number\nof network paths increases. For two priority levels over three edge-disjoint\npaths, the complete capacity region is characterized, showing that\nsuperposition coding achieves the region in general, whereas network coding is\nrequired only in a specific corner case. Moreover, sufficient conditions under\nwhich a simple superposition coding scheme achieves the capacity for an\narbitrary number of paths are identified.

Our core idea lies in\nthe fact that the vector nature of an electromagnetic wave is uniquely\ndetermined by its orthogonal electric and magnetic field components, both of\nwhich can be retrieved by a single Rydberg atomic receiver via\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)-based spectroscopy. To be\nspecific, in the presence of a static magnetic bias field that defines a stable\nquantization axis, a pair of sequential EIT measurements is carried out in the\nsame vapor cell. Firstly, the electric-field polarization angle is extracted\nfrom the Zeeman-resolved EIT spectrum associated with an electric-dipole\ntransition driven by the radio frequency (RF) field. Within the same\nexperimental cycle, the RF field is then retuned to a magnetic-dipole\nresonance, producing Zeeman-resolved EIT peaks for decoding the RF\nmagnetic-field orientation. This scheme exhibits a dual yet independent\nsensitivity on both angles, allowing for precise DoA reconstruction without the\nneed for spatial diversity or phase referencing. Building on this foundation,\nwe derive the quantum Fisher-information matrix (QFIM) and obtain a closed-form\nquantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) for the joint estimation of polarization\nand orientation angles.

One challenge in defining incentive\ncompatibility is the multiplicity of equilibria. After advertisers submit\nreports, it is unclear what the result will be and one only has knowledge of a\nrange of possible results. Nevertheless, Alimohammadi et al. proposed a notion\nof Auto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (AIC) which serves to highlight that\nauctions may not incentivize truthful reporting of constraints. However, their\ndefinition of AIC is very stringent as it requires that the worst-case outcome\nof an advertiser's truthful report is at least as good as the best-case outcome\nof any of the advertiser's possible deviations. Indeed, they show both\nFirst-Price Auction and Second-Price Auction are not AIC. Moreover, the AIC\ndefinition precludes having ordinal preferences on the possible constraints\nthat the advertiser can report.\n  In this paper, we introduce two refined and relaxed concepts: Risk-Averse\nAuto-bidding Incentive Compatibility (RAIC) and Optimistic Auto-bidding\nIncentive Compatibility (OAIC). RAIC (OAIC) stipulates that truthful reporting\nis preferred if its least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome is no worse than\nthe least (most) favorable equilibrium outcome from any misreport. This\ndistinction allows for a clearer modeling of ordinal preferences for\nadvertisers with differing attitudes towards equilibrium uncertainty. We\ndemonstrate that SPA satisfies both RAIC and OAIC. Furthermore, we show that\nSPA also meets these conditions for two advertisers when they are assumed to\nemploy uniform bidding.

First, we introduce the\nHierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures\ncomplex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for\nconstructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to\nguide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor\ndecomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree\noperation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate\npipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism:\nforward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward\nvalidation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from\npredicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of\n764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that\nST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code\nis available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor."}

However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy.

Model compression techniques\nare essential for making these models practical for resource-constrained\nenvironments. A prominent compression strategy is low-rank factorization via\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce model parameters by approximating\nweight matrices. However, standard SVD focuses on minimizing matrix\nreconstruction error, often leading to a substantial loss of the model's\nfunctional performance. This performance degradation occurs because existing\nmethods do not adequately correct for the functional information lost during\ncompression. To address this gap, we introduce Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank\nDecomposition (CALR), a two-component compression approach. CALR combines a\nprimary path of SVD-compressed layers with a parallel, learnable, low-rank\ncorrective module that is explicitly trained to recover the functional residual\nerror. Our experimental evaluation on SmolLM2-135M, Qwen3-0.6B, and\nLlama-3.2-1B, demonstrates that CALR can reduce parameter counts by 26.93% to\n51.77% while retaining 59.45% to 90.42% of the original model's performance,\nconsistently outperforming LaCo, ShortGPT, and LoSparse.

The model is trained via\na curriculum of Motion Structure Induction (MSI), using supervised fine-tuning\nto interpret kinematic phase portraits and to construct hypotheses guided by a\nCausal Chain of Thought (C-CoT), followed by Reward-Guided Symbolic Calibration\n(RGSC) to refine the formula structure with reinforcement learning. During\ninference, the trained VIPER-R1 acts as an agent: it first posits a\nhigh-confidence symbolic ansatz, then proactively invokes an external symbolic\nregression tool to perform Symbolic Residual Realignment (SR^2). This final\nstep, analogous to a physicist's perturbation analysis, reconciles the\ntheoretical model with empirical data.

Guided by the scientific tenet of the hypothesis, this Agent\nuncovers explanatory patterns in data, evaluates their statistical\nsignificance, and uses them to inform predictive modeling. It then translates\nthese results into recommendations that are both rigorous and accessible. At\nthe core of the AI Data Scientist is a team of specialized LLM Subagents, each\nresponsible for a distinct task such as data cleaning, statistical testing,\nvalidation, and plain-language communication. These Subagents write their own\ncode, reason about causality, and identify when additional data is needed to\nsupport sound conclusions. Together, they achieve in minutes what might\notherwise take days or weeks, enabling a new kind of interaction that makes\ndeep data science both accessible and actionable."}

Key technical contributions\ninclude (i) a highly efficient approximation solver for constructing node\nfeature vectors, and (ii) a theoretically-grounded problem transformation with\ncarefully-crafted techniques that enable linear-time clustering without\nexplicitly materializing the NxN dense affinity matrix. Further, we extend\nDEMM+ to handle attribute-less MRGs through non-trivial adaptations.

Given an incomplete\nprocess instance, predictions about the outcome, next activity, or remaining\ntime are created. This is done by powerful machine learning models, which have\nshown impressive predictive performance. However, the data-driven nature of\nthese models makes them susceptible to finding unfair, biased, or unethical\npatterns in the data. Such patterns lead to biased predictions based on\nso-called sensitive attributes, such as the gender or age of process\nparticipants. Previous work has identified this problem and offered solutions\nthat mitigate biases by removing sensitive attributes entirely from the process\ninstance. However, sensitive attributes can be used both fairly and unfairly in\nthe same process instance. For example, during a medical process, treatment\ndecisions could be based on gender, while the decision to accept a patient\nshould not be based on gender. This paper proposes a novel, model-agnostic\napproach for identifying and rectifying biased decisions in predictive business\nprocess monitoring models, even when the same sensitive attribute is used both\nfairly and unfairly.

However, its performance is often\nconstrained by limited communication resources, particularly in systems\nsupporting a large number of clients. To address this challenge, integrating\nover-the-air computations into the training process has emerged as a promising\nsolution to alleviate communication bottlenecks. The system significantly\nincreases the number of clients it can support in each communication round by\ntransmitting intermediate parameters via analog signals rather than digital\nones.

To elucidate these effects, this paper develops a theoretical\nframework to analyze the performance of over-the-air federated learning in\nlarge-scale client scenarios.

Proper scores are loss\nfunctions minimized by predicting the target distribution. Due to their very\ngeneral definition, proper scores apply to regression, classification, or even\ngenerative modeling tasks. We contribute several theoretical results, that\nconnect epistemic uncertainty, aleatoric uncertainty, and model calibration\nwith proper scores, resulting in a general and widely applicable framework. We\nachieve this by introducing a general bias-variance decomposition for strictly\nproper scores via functional Bregman divergences. Specifically, we use the\nkernel score, a kernel-based proper score, for evaluating sample-based\ngenerative models in various domains, like image, audio, and natural language\ngeneration.

It does not need a complete model of the system, but it typically\nrequires the construction of a deterministic automaton doubly exponential in\nthe size of the formula (in the worst case), which limits its practicality. In\nthis paper, we show that, when considering finite, discrete traces, monitoring\nof pure past (co)safety fragments of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) can be reduced\nto trace checking, that is, evaluation of a formula over a trace, that can be\nperformed in time polynomial in the size of the formula and the length of the\ntrace. By exploiting such a result, we develop a GPU-accelerated framework for\ninterpretable early failure detection based on vectorized trace checking, that\nemploys genetic programming to learn temporal properties from historical trace\ndata. The framework shows a 2-10% net improvement in key performance metrics\ncompared to the state-of-the-art methods."}

However, this standard design is neither\nincentive-compatible nor very statistically efficient. The main culprit is\nnoise in outcomes/labels that experts are scored against; it allows weaker\ncompetitors to often win by chance, and the winner-take-all nature incentivizes\nmisreporting that improves win probability even if it decreases expected score.\nAttempts to achieve incentive-compatibility rely on randomized mechanisms that\nadd even more noise in winner selection, but come at the cost of determinism\nand practical adoption. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel\ndeterministic mechanism: WOMAC (Wisdom of the Most Accurate Crowd). Instead of\nscoring experts against noisy outcomes, as is standard, WOMAC scores experts\nagainst the best ex-post aggregate of peer experts' predictions given the noisy\noutcomes. WOMAC is also more efficient than the standard competition design in\ntypical settings. While the increased complexity of WOMAC makes it challenging\nto analyze incentives directly, we provide a clear theoretical foundation to\njustify the mechanism. We also provide an efficient vectorized implementation\nand demonstrate empirically on real-world forecasting datasets that WOMAC is a\nmore reliable predictor of experts' out-of-sample performance relative to the\nstandard mechanism. WOMAC is useful in any competition where there is\nsubstantial noise in the outcomes/labels."}

However, most existing methods are tailored to single-turn scenarios\nand struggle to model the evolving intent and iterative nature of multi-turn\ndialogues when applied naively. Concurrently, test-time scaling has emerged as\na powerful paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) performance\nthrough iterative inference-time refinement. Yet, its effectiveness typically\nrelies on two conditions: (1) a well-defined problem space (e.g., mathematical\nreasoning), and (2) the model's ability to self-correct -- conditions that are\nrarely met in conversational product search. In this setting, user queries are\noften ambiguous and evolving, and MLLMs alone have difficulty grounding\nresponses in a fixed product corpus. Motivated by these challenges, we propose\na novel framework that introduces test-time scaling into conversational\nmultimodal product retrieval. Our approach builds on a generative retriever,\nfurther augmented with a test-time reranking (TTR) mechanism that improves\nretrieval accuracy and better aligns results with evolving user intent\nthroughout the dialogue.

We propose PCR-CA (Parallel Codebook\nRepresentations with Contrastive Alignment), an end-to-end framework for\nimproved CTR prediction. PCR-CA first extracts compact multimodal embeddings\nfrom app text, then introduces a Parallel Codebook VQ-AE module that learns\ndiscrete semantic representations across multiple codebooks in parallel --\nunlike hierarchical residual quantization (RQ-VAE). This design enables\nindependent encoding of diverse aspects (e.g., gameplay, art style), better\nmodeling multiple-category semantics. To bridge semantic and collaborative\nsignals, we employ a contrastive alignment loss at both the user and item\nlevels, enhancing representation learning for long-tail items. Additionally, a\ndual-attention fusion mechanism combines ID-based and semantic features to\ncapture user interests, especially for long-tail apps. Experiments on a\nlarge-scale dataset show PCR-CA achieves a +0.76% AUC improvement over strong\nbaselines, with +2.15% AUC gains for long-tail apps. Online A/B testing further\nvalidates our approach, showing a +10.52% lift in CTR and a +16.30% improvement\nin CVR, demonstrating PCR-CA's effectiveness in real-world deployment.

Despite their\nubiquity and utility, the underlying mechanisms of LLM remain concealed within\nbillions of parameters and complex structures, making their inner architecture\nand cognitive processes challenging to comprehend. We address this gap by\nadopting approaches to understanding emerging cognition in biology and\ndeveloping a network-based framework that links cognitive skills, LLM\narchitectures, and datasets, ushering in a paradigm shift in foundation model\nanalysis. The skill distribution in the module communities demonstrates that\nwhile LLMs do not strictly parallel the focalized specialization observed in\nspecific biological systems, they exhibit unique communities of modules whose\nemergent skill patterns partially mirror the distributed yet interconnected\ncognitive organization seen in avian and small mammalian brains. Our numerical\nresults highlight a key divergence from biological systems to LLMs, where skill\nacquisition benefits substantially from dynamic, cross-regional interactions\nand neural plasticity. By integrating cognitive science principles with machine\nlearning, our framework provides new insights into LLM interpretability and\nsuggests that effective fine-tuning strategies should leverage distributed\nlearning dynamics rather than rigid modular interventions."}
