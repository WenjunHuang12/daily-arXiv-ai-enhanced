### [1] [Fundamental bounds on efficiency-confidence trade-off for transductive conformal prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04631)
*Arash Behboodi,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Fabio Valerio Massoli,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了转导性共形预测中置信度与效率之间的基本权衡关系，当置信度非平凡时，预测集大小会随样本数量呈指数级增长，且指数与数据条件熵成正比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究转导性共形预测方法中同时预测多个数据点时，置信度与预测集效率之间的根本性权衡关系，为理解该方法的理论局限性提供依据。

Method: 推导严格的有限样本边界，分析预测集大小与置信水平的关系，引入条件熵和离散度（对数条件概率分布的方差）作为关键参数，并在理想化设置中证明边界的可达性。

Result: 发现任何非平凡置信水平都会导致预测集大小呈指数增长，指数与样本数量线性相关且与条件熵成正比；针对所有测试点共享同一标签的特殊情况，提供了渐近最优置信预测器。

Conclusion: 转导性共形预测存在置信度与效率的根本权衡，高置信度要求必然导致预测集规模膨胀，这一理论边界在实际应用中具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

### [2] [Q-SafeML: Safety Assessment of Quantum Machine Learning via Quantum Distance Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04536)
*Oliver Dunn,Koorosh Aslansefat,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-SafeML是一种针对量子机器学习的安全监控方法，通过量子特定的距离度量来检测概念漂移，提高系统透明度和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在安全关键系统中应用增长，但现有经典ML安全监控方法无法直接适用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子中心距离度量，在分类后评估模型准确性，检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够实现知情的人工监督

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了有效的安全监控解决方案，适应了量子系统的独特表示约束

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

### [3] [Finance-Grounded Optimization For Algorithmic Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04541)
*Kasymkhan Khubiev,Mikhail Semenov,Irina Podlipnova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于金融指标的损失函数（夏普比率、PnL、最大回撤）和换手率正则化方法，在算法交易指标上优于传统的均方误差损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在金融领域的应用面临可解释性挑战，传统方法虽然在其他领域表现良好，但不完全适合金融领域，因为金融专家使用不同的指标来评估模型性能。

Method: 引入基于关键量化金融指标的损失函数（夏普比率、利润损失、最大回撤），并提出换手率正则化方法来限制生成头寸的换手率在预定范围内。

Result: 研究表明，提出的损失函数结合换手率正则化，在算法交易指标评估中优于传统的均方误差损失函数。

Conclusion: 基于金融指标的度量方法能够提高交易策略和投资组合优化中的预测性能。

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

### [5] [Bootstrapping Task Spaces for Self-Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04575)
*Minqi Jiang,Andrei Lupu,Yoram Bachrach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Exploratory Iteration (ExIt)方法，通过自课程强化学习训练LLMs进行多步自我改进，仅需训练单步迭代即可实现推理时的多步自我提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RL方法需要固定最大迭代深度的问题，利用自我改进任务的循环结构来更高效地训练自我改进策略

Method: 通过选择性采样信息量最大的中间部分历史作为新的自我迭代任务实例，扩展任务空间并训练自我改进策略，可结合显式探索机制维持任务多样性

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt方法能够产生在推理时对未见任务实例进行有效自我改进的策略，迭代步数超出训练时的平均迭代深度

Conclusion: ExIt方法成功展示了如何通过自课程RL训练LLMs实现推理时的多步自我改进，突破了传统固定迭代深度的限制

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

### [6] [Instance-Wise Adaptive Sampling for Dataset Construction in Approximating Inverse Problem Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04583)
*Jiequn Han,Kui Ren,Nathan Soedjak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于实例的自适应采样框架，用于构建紧凑且信息丰富的训练数据集，通过动态分配采样资源来显著提高样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法需要从先验分布中抽取大量训练样本，当先验分布维度高或需要高精度时，数据收集成本巨大。需要针对特定测试实例优化采样策略

Method: 迭代式自适应采样框架，根据最新预测结果动态调整训练数据集，使数据集适应每个测试实例周围逆映射的几何结构

Result: 在逆散射问题中验证了方法的有效性，在复杂先验分布或高精度要求下优势更加明显

Conclusion: 自适应采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展的实用替代方案

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出量子增强加权多任务学习框架(QW-MTL)，用于ADMET分类任务，在13个TDC基准测试中12个任务上显著优于单任务基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单任务学习方法无法充分利用任务间的互补性，且计算资源消耗大，需要开发更高效的多任务学习框架

Method: 基于Chemprop-RDKit骨干网络，采用量子化学描述符丰富分子表征，引入指数任务加权方案实现动态损失平衡

Result: 在13个TDC分类基准测试中，12个任务上显著优于单任务基线，具有最小模型复杂度和快速推理能力

Conclusion: 量子信息特征和自适应任务加权增强的多任务分子学习具有有效性和高效性，为ADMET预测提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

### [9] [Measuring the Measures: Discriminative Capacity of Representational Similarity Metrics Across Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04622)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个定量框架来评估表征相似性度量方法区分不同模型家族的能力，发现对齐约束越严格的度量方法分离性越好，其中软匹配方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表征相似性度量是神经科学和AI的基础工具，但缺乏对不同度量方法区分模型家族能力的系统比较。

Method: 使用三种互补的分离性度量指标（dprime、轮廓系数和ROC-AUC），系统评估了RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配等常用度量方法在不同架构和训练机制模型上的区分能力。

Result: 分离性随着度量方法施加更严格的对齐约束而系统性增加。在基于映射的方法中，软匹配获得最高分离性，其次是Procrustes对齐和线性预测性。非拟合方法如RSA也能产生良好的家族间分离性。

Conclusion: 研究首次通过分离性视角系统比较了相似性度量方法，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和大脑比较中的度量选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

### [10] [Split Conformal Prediction in the Function Space with Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04623)
*David Millard,Lars Lindemann,Ali Baheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将分形共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供有限样本覆盖保证，解决了无限维设置中的不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子在无限维设置中的不确定性量化缺乏对函数输出的有限样本覆盖保证，现有方法需要强分布假设或产生保守覆盖。

Method: 采用两步法：首先在有限维空间建立覆盖保证，然后通过离散化细化将保证提升到函数空间；提出回归校正来跨分辨率传递校准，并设计两个诊断指标。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖且变化较小，在超分辨率任务中实现更好的覆盖。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

### [11] [Interpreting Transformer Architectures as Implicit Multinomial Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04653)
*Jonas A. Actor,Anthony Gruber,Eric C. Cyr*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文建立了注意力机制与多项式回归之间的新联系，证明在固定多项式回归设置中，优化潜在特征会产生与注意力块动态一致的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管注意力机制在Transformer模型中扮演核心角色，但其数学基础以及与特征多义性、叠加和模型性能等概念的关系仍然理解不足。机制可解释性旨在理解现代机器学习模型内部组件如何产生整体行为。

Method: 在固定多项式回归设置中优化潜在特征，分析最优解与注意力块诱导动态的一致性，将Transformer中的表示演化解释为恢复分类最优特征的轨迹。

Result: 研究发现注意力机制的最优解与多项式回归中的特征优化解相一致，为理解注意力机制提供了新的数学框架。

Conclusion: 注意力机制可以理解为在多项式回归框架下恢复最优分类特征的过程，这一发现为机制可解释性研究提供了重要的理论洞见。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

### [12] [Flexible inference of learning rules from de novo learning data using neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04661)
*Yuhan Helena Liu,Victor Geadah,Jonathan Pillow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过深度神经网络框架从动物初始学习行为数据中推断学习规则，发现了错误与正确试验的不对称更新和历史依赖性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物学习机制研究对神经科学和AI发展重要，但现有方法偏向参数化假设或简化场景，无法模拟动物初始学习新行为的复杂性

Method: 提出非参数化框架，用DNN定义每试验改策更新，RNN版本包含历史依赖性，并在模拟中验证了真实规则恢复能力

Conclusion: 该灵活框架能够从行为数据中推断生物学习规则，为实验训练协议和行为数字双胞开发提供了新视角

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

### [13] [Beyond Ordinary Lipschitz Constraints: Differentially Private Stochastic Optimization with Tsybakov Noise Condition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04668)
*Difei Xu,Meng Ding,Zihang Xiang,Jinhui Xu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究差分隐私下的随机凸优化问题，针对满足Tsybakov噪声条件且梯度具有有界矩的损失函数，提出了新的隐私保护算法并建立了上下界理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私凸优化研究通常假设损失函数是Lipschitz连续的，但在实际应用中这一假设可能过于严格。本文旨在放宽这一假设，研究梯度具有有界矩但可能非Lipschitz的损失函数在差分隐私下的优化问题。

Method: 提出了(ε,δ)-差分隐私算法，利用梯度有界矩的特性，通过精心设计的隐私机制来处理可能无界的Lipschitz常数问题。对于θ≥2的情况，算法能够实现与Lipschitz常数无关的效用上界。

Result: 获得了高概率下的效用上界：Õ((ṽ₂ₖ(1/√n + √d/nε))^(k-1)/k)^(θ/(θ-1)))，该上界独立于Lipschitz常数。当隐私预算ε足够小时，即使损失函数非Lipschitz也能获得类似上界。同时建立了ρ-zero集中差分隐私的下界。

Conclusion: 本文成功放宽了差分隐私凸优化中对Lipschitz连续性的严格要求，证明了在梯度有界矩条件下仍能获得良好的隐私-效用权衡，为处理更广泛的现实问题提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习可以准确检测复杂系统中的闪烁现象（噪声驱动的状态切换），这是系统韧性降低的早期预警信号，在气候、生态、金融等多个领域具有重要意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是复杂系统（如气候系统、生态系统、金融市场）韧性降低的重要标志，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面表现出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁现象方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，然后推广到各种随机系统和真实数据集进行测试。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，尽管在简化动态上训练，但能很好地泛化到不同的随机系统，并在实证数据（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据）中可靠地检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从嘈杂的非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别各种动力系统的不稳定性提供了一个灵活的框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Result: 实验评估表明，KRATF不仅在地图融合任务中相比最先进方法和基线方法表现出色，其各个模块（如地图匹配和地图合并）也分别优于传统的匹配和合并方法。

Conclusion: KRATF通过基于学习的方法成功解决了地图融合中的关键挑战，为地理空间数据库的更新和增强提供了有效解决方案，在性能和模块化方面都表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

TL;DR: 提出CPEP框架，通过对比学习对齐EMG和姿态表示，提升弱模态数据的表征质量，实现零样本手势分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低成本生物信号（如表面肌电信号sEMG）实现连续手势识别，但弱模态数据质量较差。通过将其与高质量结构化数据（如姿态数据）对齐，可以提升表征质量并实现零样本分类

Method: 提出对比姿态-EMG预训练（CPEP）框架，学习一个能产生高质量且包含姿态信息的EMG编码器，通过对比学习对齐EMG和姿态表示

Result: 在线性探测和零样本设置下评估手势分类性能，相比emg2pose基准模型，在分布内手势分类上提升21%，在未见（分布外）手势分类上提升72%

Conclusion: 通过学习弱模态数据与高质量结构化数据的对齐表示，可以显著提升EMG手势分类性能，特别是在零样本场景下表现突出

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于共形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对理想轨迹的高覆盖概率，解决了传统解码方法缺乏可证明覆盖保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search虽然能生成合理的候选集，但缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，且在搜索效率和多样化轨迹需求（特别是长尾序列）之间难以有效平衡。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，基于共形预测框架构建无模型解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为复杂推理任务提供了一种具有可证明覆盖保证的解码方案，特别适用于需要长尾序列的真实应用场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架发现23种表示学习方法隐式最小化数据和学习分布间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题，且可能与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，探索替代统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核（如距离核替代角度核），系统性地发现新的损失函数。

Result: 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类中达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中超越标准方法；在降维任务中获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 统计散度和相似性核的选择对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

Motivation: 解决简化的跨注意力模型忽视了经典统计模型所能捐捕的细粒度局部时间依赖关系的问题。

Method: 提出VARMA受启发的特征提取器(VFE)模拟自回归和滑动平均模式，以及使用时间门控制的VARMA增强注意力机制(VE-atten)来提升查询的上下文感知能力。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行的实验表明，该模型在性能上一贯超过现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将经典统计见解集成到现代深度学习框架中，对于时间序列预测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Conclusion: ACED-DQN框架成功实现了RL代理的持续学习能力，为受大脑启发的强化学习系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

Result: 该方法能够有效分离误差来源，支持更有针对性的模型改进，并在模型内部类别表示空间中提供几何解释

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种理解分类器行为的深层视角，揭示了归一化对分类器内部表示的几何意义

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA是一种基于谱方法的物理信息神经网络，通过谱基投影和神经ODE集成来解决PINNs在复杂初值问题中的收敛困难、因果性违反和频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并存在低频频谱偏差，需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适应的神经ODE进行集成，利用谱表示的高频分量克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构强制因果性，并通过基于经典方法的初始化方案在目标解附近开始训练。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和优越的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE的优势，成功解决了PINNs在复杂PDE问题中的关键挑战，为物理信息神经网络提供了新的有效架构。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Motivation: 解决动态拓扑环境下路由策略优化面临的决策不稳定和结构感知不足的挑战

Method: 结合SASE模块（多层图卷积和结构位置嵌入）和PAGU模块（基于策略行为变化和奖励反馈调整图结构），构建统一的状态表示和结构演化框架

Result: 在GEANT拓扑数据集上实验表明，该方法在吞吐量、延迟控制和链路平衡等多个性能指标上优于现有图强化学习模型

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究测试时适配(TTA)在实际部署中的不稳定性问题，提出了SAR和SAR²方法来稳定TTA性能，通过移除噪声样本、促进平坦最小值和防止表征崩溃来提高适配稳定性。


<details>

Motivation: 实际部署中，TTA方法在混合分布偏移、小批次大小和在线不平衡标签分布偏移情况下容易失效或造成模型性能下降，这是阻碍TTA在真实世界应用的关键障碍。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的方法在各种野外测试场景下都能更稳定地运行，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 该研究通过分析TTA失效的根本原因和提出相应解决方案，有效提高了测试时适配在实际应用中的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在生物医学信号处理中显示出潜力，但具有计算资源需求大的挑战，特别是在需要实时检测或资源有限的环境中。需要开发更高效、更可靠的模型来支持狂狂检测。

Method: 设计了轻量化一维CNN模型，采用结构化剪削技术，根据卷积内核对模型预测的重要性移除50%的内核。同时使用轻度早停正则化来防止过拟合。

Result: 基线模型达到了92.78%的准确率和0.8686的宏观F1分数。剪削后模型在减少了50%的权重和内存的情况下，准确率提升到92.87%，宏观F1分数提升到0.8707，保持了预测能力。

Conclusion: 结构化剪削能够有效移除模型冗余部分，提高模型的普遍化能力。结合轻度早停技术，为提高狂狂检测的效率和可靠性提供了有前景的方向，尤其适用于资源有限的设置。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based

3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Motivation: 为了解决传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)需要针对每个PDE问题进行单独训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到各类参数化PDE的通用神经算子。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础潜力，显著提高精度并降低计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Motivation: 许多数据集中的类别标签具有层次结构，虽然分类任务通常在特定层级定义，但训练时可以使用更细粒度的标签。现有经验证据表明细粒度训练可能提升性能，但需要系统研究其普适性和内在机制

Method: 使用真实和合成数据集，分析细粒度标签训练对分类准确性的影响，重点考察数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量等因素的作用

Result: 细粒度标签训练并不总是能提高分类准确性，其有效性关键取决于数据的几何结构及其与标签层次的关系。数据集大小和模型容量也显著影响细粒度标签是否带来性能提升

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练的效果是有条件的，需要根据具体的数据特征和任务要求来评估是否采用这种策略，不能一概而论

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

*Dmitry Akulov,Mohamed Sana,Antonio De Domenico,Tareq Si Salem,Nicola Piovesan,Fadhel Ayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力引导、层自适应复合令牌的KV缓存压缩框架，通过聚合注意力分数估计令牌重要性，选择头特定令牌并对齐到复合令牌中，保持标准推理引擎所需的统一缓存结构。

Result: 实现了显著的内存减少同时保持准确性，持续优于先前的结构化和半结构化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法与标准推理管道完全兼容，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 移位操作能有效揭示后继度量的低秩结构，为强化学习算法提供了更准确的理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Motivation: 优化胺基烷烷碳投放系统的运行效率，减少胺排放，提高碳投放技术的稳定性和可持续性。

Method: 使用CESAR1溶剂运行数据，开发四种LSTM深度学习模型（基础LSTM、堆叠LSTM、双向LSTM、卷积LSTM），预测AMP和Piperazine排放以及四个关键性能参数，并进行因果影响分析。

Result: 模型预测准确度超过99%，能有效跟踪稳态趋势和突变波动。因果分析显示，调整过温溶剂温度和水洗条件等参数可显著降低胺排放并提升系统性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明机器学习不仅是预测工具，还可作为决策支持系统，为碳投放操作提供实时监控、场景测试和运行优化的实用方案，推动智能化数据驱动的控制策略。

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力系统自动发电控制(AGC)对电网稳定性至关重要，但容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击，如虚假数据注入攻击(FDIAs)，传统检测方法难以发现这些攻击。

Method: 使用KAN模型离线学习AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，并能够提取符号方程来增强模型的可解释性。

Result: 提出的KAN模型在FDIA检测方面达到95.97%的检测率，符号公式达到95.9%的检测率，且误报率低。

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC网络安全提供了可靠且可解释的方法，能够有效检测隐蔽的网络攻击。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Motivation: 深度强化学习的计算需求日益增长，但其能耗、温室气体排放和经济成本尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性评估以促进可持续发展。

Method: 使用Stable Baselines实现7种DRL算法（DQN、TRPO、A2C、ARS、PPO、RecurrentPPO、QR-DQN），在10个Atari 2600游戏上各训练100万步，实时测量功耗并计算能耗、CO2排放和电力成本。

Conclusion: 研究为开发节能高效的DRL实践提供了可行见解，建立了将可持续性考量纳入未来算法设计和评估的基础。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and

benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统手动调优方法在广告推荐系统中存在调优目标不明确、参数组合过多、缺乏个性化和季节性适应性等问题

Method: 提出DRL-PUT框架，将问题形式化为强化学习任务，直接从在线服务日志中学习最优策略模型，避免估计价值函数

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架能够有效解决广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，实现个性化调优和效果显著提升

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity
and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation
learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent
representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts
multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral
ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution
modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple
latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention
mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user
preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and
covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This
reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a
learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term
behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both
recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard
public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing
representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater
stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance
scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional
methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in
real-world recommendation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized
recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing
user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest
modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text
labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a
complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest
modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual
descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using
cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user
interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature
embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences
to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and
accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive
evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing
our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling
techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction
accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation
click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using
attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision
basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the
transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.

Motivation: 基础RAG在处理法律监管领域众多政府文档的复杂QA任务时存在困难，top-k策略经常错过关键信息块，导致答案不完整或不准确。

Method: 1. One-SHOT检索方法：基于token预算自适应选择信息块，在模型上下文窗口内包含尽可能多的相关内容，并设计模块进行进一步过滤和精炼。2. 迭代检索策略：基于推理代理RAG框架，推理LLM动态发布搜索查询、评估检索结果，并在多轮中逐步精炼上下文。

Result: 通过在政府文档数据集上的广泛实验，为法律监管领域的实际应用提供了实用见解和指导。

Conclusion: 提出的两种检索策略有效解决了RAG系统在法律监管文档处理中的证据覆盖和答案质量问题，为复杂QA任务提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a powerful solution to understand and query the industry's closed-source
documents. However, basic RAG often struggles with complex QA tasks in legal
and regulatory domains, particularly when dealing with numerous government
documents. The top-$k$ strategy frequently misses golden chunks, leading to
incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these retrieval bottlenecks, we
explore two strategies to improve evidence coverage and answer quality. The
first is a One-SHOT retrieval method that adaptively selects chunks based on a
token budget, allowing as much relevant content as possible to be included
within the model's context window. Additionally, we design modules to further
filter and refine the chunks. The second is an iterative retrieval strategy
built on a Reasoning Agentic RAG framework, where a reasoning LLM dynamically
issues search queries, evaluates retrieved results, and progressively refines
the context over multiple turns. We identify query drift and retrieval laziness
issues and further design two modules to tackle them. Through extensive
experiments on a dataset of government documents, we aim to offer practical
insights and guidance for real-world applications in legal and regulatory
domains.

Abstract: In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural
networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems,
demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this
domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by
employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem
and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved
favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based
on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the
graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second
applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information
obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid
Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two
distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and
singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global
collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental
results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.

Result: 在两个数据集（Web表格和开放数据）上的广泛评估显示，SI-LLM取得了有前景的端到端结果，在每一步都达到或优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: SI-LLM为元数据有限的表格数据提供了一种有效的模式推断方法，所有源代码、完整提示和数据集均已开源。

Abstract: Minimally curated tabular data often contain representational inconsistencies
across heterogeneous sources, and are accompanied by sparse metadata. Working
with such data is intimidating. While prior work has advanced dataset discovery
and exploration, schema inference remains difficult when metadata are limited.
We present SI-LLM (Schema Inference using Large Language Models), which infers
a concise conceptual schema for tabular data using only column headers and cell
values. The inferred schema comprises hierarchical entity types, attributes,
and inter-type relationships. In extensive evaluation on two datasets from web
tables and open data, SI-LLM achieves promising end-to-end results, as well as
better or comparable results to state-of-the-art methods at each step. All
source code, full prompts, and datasets of SI-LLM are available at

### [57] [Efficient Exact Resistance Distance Computation on Small-Treewidth Graphs: a Labelling Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05129)
*Meihao Liao,Yueyang Pan,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TreeIndex算法，通过树分解和标签化技术，在小树宽图上高效计算准确的阻弹距离，解决了以前随机游走方法效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机游走基于阻弹距离计算方法在小树宽图（如道路网络）上效率较低且只能近似计算，而最短路径距离计算在这类图上表现出艰，因此需要开发一种新的准确高效算法。

Method: 分析阻弹距离的切分性质，结合树分解技术，发现阻弹距离只依赖于路径上的标签。基于此提出TreeIndex标签化方法，构建紧凑的标签结构，支持准确查询。

Result: 在USA道路网络上，TreeIndex构建了405GB标签化（单线程7小时），单对查询耗10^-3秒，单源查询耗190秒，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: TreeIndex是首个可扩展到大规模小树宽图的准确阻弹距离计算方法，为图分析领域提供了重要技术进展。

Abstract: Resistance distance computation is a fundamental problem in graph analysis,
yet existing random walk-based methods are limited to approximate solutions and
suffer from poor efficiency on small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). In
contrast, shortest-path distance computation achieves remarkable efficiency on
such graphs by leveraging cut properties and tree decompositions. Motivated by
this disparity, we first analyze the cut property of resistance distance. While
a direct generalization proves impractical due to costly matrix operations, we
overcome this limitation by integrating tree decompositions, revealing that the
resistance distance $r(s,t)$ depends only on labels along the paths from $s$
and $t$ to the root of the decomposition. This insight enables compact
labelling structures. Based on this, we propose \treeindex, a novel index
method that constructs a resistance distance labelling of size $O(n \cdot
h_{\mathcal{G}})$ in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}}^2 \cdot d_{\max})$ time, where
$h_{\mathcal{G}}$ (tree height) and $d_{\max}$ (maximum degree) behave as small
constants in many real-world small-treewidth graphs (e.g., road networks). Our
labelling supports exact single-pair queries in $O(h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time and
single-source queries in $O(n \cdot h_{\mathcal{G}})$ time. Extensive
experiments show that TreeIndex substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches. For instance, on the full USA road network, it constructs a $405$
GB labelling in $7$ hours (single-threaded) and answers exact single-pair
queries in $10^{-3}$ seconds and single-source queries in $190$ seconds--the
first exact method scalable to such large graphs.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的传递性保持投影(TPP)方法，用于解决有向超图可视化中的计算复杂性问题，相比传统的Basu和 Blanning投影(BBP)方法，TPP在保持传递关系完整性的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有向超图在多个领域中用于建模复杂的多元关系，但其固有的复杂性阻碍了有效的可视化和分析，特别是对于大型图。现有的BBP方法计算强度大且可能增加复杂性。

Method: 开发了传递性保持投影(TPP)方法，利用set-trie数据结构，通过捕获不可约主导元路径来最小化边集，同时保持所有必要的传递和直接连接。算法将计算复杂度从指数级降低到线性级。

Result: 实验结果表明TPP性能优越，在BBP无法在24小时内完成的图上，TPP能在几秒钟内完成投影。

Conclusion: TPP提供了一种最小但完整的关系视图，支持网络安全和供应链等应用，显著提高了有向超图的可视化和分析效率。

Abstract: Directed hypergraphs are vital for modeling complex polyadic relationships in
domains such as discrete mathematics, computer science, network security, and
systems modeling. However, their inherent complexity often impedes effective
visualization and analysis, particularly for large graphs. This paper
introduces a novel Transitivity Preserving Projection (TPP) to address the
limitations of the computationally intensive Basu and Blanning projection
(BBP), which can paradoxically increase complexity by flattening transitive
relationships. TPP offers a minimal and complete representation of
relationships within a chosen subset of elements, capturing only irreducible
dominant metapaths to ensure the smallest set of edges while preserving all
essential transitive and direct connections. This approach significantly
enhances visualization by reducing edge proliferation and maintains the
integrity of the original hypergraph's structure. We develop an efficient
algorithm leveraging the set-trie data structure, reducing the computational
complexity from an exponential number of metapath searches in BBP to a linear
number of metapath searches with polynomial-time filtering, enabling
scalability for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate TPP's
superior performance, completing projections in seconds on graphs where BBP
fails to terminate within 24 hours. By providing a minimal yet complete view of
relationships, TPP supports applications in network security and supply

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了多个近似最短路径算法，包括稠密加权图的+2∑W_i-APASP算法、近乎加性APASP算法和改进的乘法APASP框架，突破了现有的条件下限限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稠密加权图中近似最短路径问题，改进现有算法的运行时间和近似精度，突破Dor等人提出的条件下限限制。

Method: 开发了新的算法框架，包括：稠密加权图的+2∑W_i-APASP算法、近乎加性(1+ε,min{2W1,4W2})-APASP算法、以及改进的乘法APASP框架。

Result: 获得了多项改进：稠密加权图算法运行时间为Õ(n^(2+1/(3k+2)))，近乎加性算法运行时间为Õ((1/ε)^O(1)·n^2.15135313·logW)，乘法APASP框架达到(3ℓ+4)/(ℓ+2)+ε近似比。

Conclusion: 本文在近似最短路径算法领域取得了显著进展，特别是在稠密加权图处理、近乎加性近似和乘法近似方面，成功突破了现有的条件下限限制。

Abstract: We present a $+2\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{W_i}$-APASP algorithm for dense weighted
graphs with runtime $\tilde O\left(n^{2+\frac{1}{3k+2}}\right)$, where $W_{i}$
is the weight of an $i^\textnormal{th}$ heaviest edge on a shortest path. Dor,
Halperin and Zwick [FOCS'96, SICOMP'00] had two algorithms for the commensurate
unweighted $+2\cdot\left( k+1\right)$-APASP: $\tilde
O\left(n^{2-\frac{1}{k+2}}m^{\frac{1}{k+2}}\right)$ runtime for sparse graphs
and $\tilde O\left(n^{2+\frac{1}{3k+2}}\right)$ runtime for dense graphs. Cohen
and Zwick [SODA'97, JALG'01] adapted the sparse variant to weighted graphs:
$+2\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{W_i}$-APASP algorithm in the same runtime. We show an
algorithm for dense weighted graphs.
  For \emph{nearly additive} APASP, we present a
$\left(1+\varepsilon,\min{\left\{2W_1,4W_{2}\right\}}\right)$-APASP algorithm
with $\tilde O\left(\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{O\left(1\right)}\cdot
n^{2.15135313}\cdot\log W\right)$ runtime. This improves the
$\left(1+\varepsilon,2W_1\right)$-APASP of Saha and Ye [SODA'24].
  For multiplicative APASP, we show a framework of $\left(\frac{3\ell +4}{\ell
+ 2}+\varepsilon\right)$-APASP algorithms, reducing the runtime of Akav and
Roditty [ESA'21] for dense graphs and generalizing the
$\left(2+\varepsilon\right)$-APASP algorithm of Dory et al [SODA'24]. Our base
case is a $\left(\frac{7}{3}+\varepsilon\right)$-APASP in $\tilde
O\left(\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)^{O\left(1\right)}\cdot
n^{2.15135313}\cdot \log W\right)$ runtime, improving the $\frac{7}{3}$-APASP
algorithm of Baswana and Kavitha [FOCS'06, SICOMP'10] for dense graphs.
  Finally, we "bypass" an $\tilde \Omega \left(n^\omega\right)$ conditional
lower bound by Dor, Halperin, and Zwick for $\alpha$-APASP with $\alpha < 2$,
by allowing an additive term (e.g.
$\paren{\frac{6k+3}{3k+2},\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}{W_{i}}}$-APASP in $\tilde
O\left(n^{2+\frac{1}{3k+2}}\right)$ runtime.).

### [60] [List Decoding Expander-Based Codes via Fast Approximation of Expanding CSPs: I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05203)
*Fernando Granha Jeronimo,Aman Singh*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于扩展码的线性时间列表解码算法，针对三种不同类型的编码结构提供了高效的解码方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码解码算法在处理大规模数据时效率较低，需要开发近线性时间的列表解码算法来提高解码效率，特别是在扩展码构造中实现高效解码。

Method: 将解码任务表述为扩展图上的协议约束满足问题，利用[Jer23]中基于弱正则分解的快速近似算法，通过枚举分解各部分中的常量赋值来恢复所有码字。

Result: 成功设计了三种编码家族：(1)具有固定字母大小的Tanner LDPC码，(2)字母大小指数级的AEL码，(3)使用最新列表大小界限的双指数字母大小AEL码，所有方案都实现了近线性时间解码。

Conclusion: 通过将解码问题转化为扩展图上的CSP问题并应用快速近似算法，实现了扩展码构造的高效近线性时间列表解码，为编码理论提供了重要的算法突破。

Abstract: We present near-linear time list decoding algorithms (in the block-length
$n$) for expander-based code constructions. More precisely, we show that
  (i) For every $\delta \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an explicit
family of good Tanner LDPC codes of (design) distance $\delta$ that is $(\delta
- \epsilon, O_\varepsilon(1))$ list decodable in time
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $O_\delta(1)$,
  (ii) For every $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an explicit family
of AEL codes of rate $R$, distance $1-R -\varepsilon$ that is $(1-R-\epsilon,
O_\varepsilon(1))$ list decodable in time
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size
$\text{exp}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$, and
  (iii) For every $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an explicit family
of AEL codes of rate $R$, distance $1-R-\varepsilon$ that is $(1-R-\epsilon,
O(1/\epsilon))$ list decodable in time
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size
$\text{exp}(\text{exp}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)))$ using recent near-optimal
list size bounds from [JMST25].
  Our results are obtained by phrasing the decoding task as an agreement CSP
[RWZ20,DHKNT19] on expander graphs and using the fast approximation algorithm
for $q$-ary expanding CSPs from [Jer23], which is based on weak regularity
decomposition [JST21,FK96]. Similarly to list decoding $q$-ary Ta-Shma's codes
in [Jer23], we show that it suffices to enumerate over assignments that are
constant in each part (of the constantly many) of the decomposition in order to
recover all codewords in the list.

### [61] [A 13/6-Approximation for Strip Packing via the Bottom-Left Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04654)
*Stefan Hougardy,Bart Zondervan*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了新的矩形排序方法，使Bottom-Left算法在条带装箱问题中的近似比从3改进到13/6


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bottom-Left算法作为条带装箱问题的经典启发式算法，45年来其近似比一直停留在3，需要寻找更好的排序策略来改进性能

Method: 引入新的矩形排序方法，配合Bottom-Left算法（将矩形按固定顺序放置，每次选择最低且最左的可行位置）

Result: 使用新排序方法后，Bottom-Left算法的近似比从3提升到13/6（约2.167）

Conclusion: 通过创新的排序策略，显著改进了经典Bottom-Left算法在条带装箱问题中的性能表现，打破了45年来的性能瓶颈

Abstract: In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width
and unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is
to place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing
the height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left
Algorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a
fixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the
lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one.
Baker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has
approximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the
past 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound.
We introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the
Bottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing
problem.

### [62] [Parameterized Approximability for Modular Linear Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04976)
*Konrad K. Dabrowski,Peter Jonsson,Sebastian Ordyniak,George Osipov,Magnus Wahlström*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了Min-r-Lin(Z_m)问题的参数化近似算法，针对模m的线性方程组系统，提出了在素数幂模数下的2倍近似FPT算法，并给出了相关下界结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Min-r-Lin(Z_m)问题是NP难且UGC难近似的问题，即使在r=m=2时也难以在多项式时间内获得常数因子近似。Dabrowski等人的工作表明该问题在模数为素数时属于FPT，但模数非素数幂时是W[1]-难的。本文旨在研究参数化近似算法，以解的大小作为参数。

Method: 通过逐步求解更紧的松弛问题来减少变量的可能取值集合。在模p^n下，将值视为p进制表示，松弛问题固定变量值的尾随零个数和最低有效非零数字。通过构造特定图，将解识别为特定的割集。使用基于影子移除的策略来计算近似解。

Result: 证明了对于任意素数p和整数n≥2，Min-2-Lin(Z_{p^n})可以在因子2内FPT近似。这意味着对于任意正整数m，Min-2-Lin(Z_m)可以在2ω(m)因子内FPT近似，其中ω(m)是m的不同素因子的个数。

Conclusion: 本文为Min-2-Lin(Z_m)问题提供了有效的参数化近似算法，同时给出了下界结果，排除了在某些环上获得常数因子FPT近似的可能性，为该问题的近似算法研究提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We consider the Min-$r$-Lin$(Z_m)$ problem: given a system $S$ of length-$r$
linear equations modulo $m$, find $Z \subseteq S$ of minimum cardinality such
that $S-Z$ is satisfiable. The problem is NP-hard and UGC-hard to approximate
in polynomial time within any constant factor even when $r = m = 2$. We focus
on parameterized approximation with solution size as the parameter. Dabrowski
et al. showed that Min-$2$-Lin$(Z_m)$ is in FPT if $m$ is prime (i.e. $Z_m$ is
a field), and it is W[1]-hard if $m$ is not a prime power. We show that
Min-$2$-Lin$(Z_{p^n})$ is FPT-approximable within a factor of $2$ for every
prime $p$ and integer $n \geq 2$. This implies that Min-$2$-Lin$(Z_m)$, $m \in
Z^+$, is FPT-approximable within a factor of $2\omega(m)$ where $\omega(m)$
counts the number of distinct prime divisors of $m$. The idea behind the
algorithm is to solve ever tighter relaxations of the problem, decreasing the
set of possible values for the variables at each step. Working over $Z_{p^n}$
and viewing the values in base-$p$, one can roughly think of a relaxation as
fixing the number of trailing zeros and the least significant nonzero digits of
the values assigned to the variables. To solve the relaxed problem, we
construct a certain graph where solutions can be identified with a particular
collection of cuts. The relaxation may hide obstructions that will only become
visible in the next iteration of the algorithm, which makes it difficult to
find optimal solutions. To deal with this, we use a strategy based on shadow
removal to compute solutions that (1) cost at most twice as much as the optimum
and (2) allow us to reduce the set of values for all variables simultaneously.
We complement the algorithmic result with two lower bounds, ruling out
constant-factor FPT-approximation for Min-$3$-Lin$(R)$ over any nontrivial ring
$R$ and for Min-$2$-Lin$(R)$ over some finite commutative rings $R$.

Motivation: 研究图重构问题中不同oracle的能力，特别关注返回连通分量信息的新型oracle，旨在表征该oracle在查询复杂度方面的强弱

Method: 使用自适应随机算法，通过分析图的顶点数n、边数m、最大度Δ和树宽k等参数，设计高效的查询策略来重构隐藏图

Result: 提出了在O(min{m, Δ², k²}·log n)次CC查询内解决图重构问题的算法，并证明了Ω(min{m, Δ², k²})的查询复杂度下界，表明算法在渐进意义下是最优的

Conclusion: 新型连通分量oracle在图重构问题中具有强大的能力，所提算法在查询复杂度上达到渐进最优，为图重构问题的oracle设计提供了新的理论保证

Abstract: In the Graph Reconstruction (GR) problem, the goal is to recover a hidden
graph by utilizing some oracle that provides limited access to the structure of
the graph. The interest is in characterizing how strong different oracles are
when the complexity of an algorithm is measured in the number of performed
queries. We study a novel oracle that returns the set of connected components
(CC) on the subgraph induced by the queried subset of vertices. Our main
contributions are as follows:
  1. For a hidden graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, maximum degree $\Delta$,
and treewidth $k$, GR can be solved in $O(\min\{m, \Delta^2, k^2\} \cdot \log
n)$ CC queries by an adaptive randomized algorithm.
  2. For a hidden graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, maximum degree $\Delta$,
and treewidth $k$, no algorithm can solve GR in $o(\min\{m, \Delta^2, k^2\})$
CC queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: f-散度是衡量两个分布差异的基本概念，本文旨在解决Ising模型之间f-散度的近似计算问题，这是对最近TV距离近似工作的推广。

Method: 给定两个由交互矩阵和外场指定的Ising模型，研究如何在任意相对误差e^(±ε)内近似f-散度D_f(ν‖μ)。针对常数整数α的χ^α-散度，建立了算法和硬度结果。

Result: 算法在匹配硬度结果的参数范围内有效工作，并且可以扩展到其他f-散度，包括α-散度、KL散度、Rényi散度、Jensen-Shannon散度和平方Hellinger距离。

Conclusion: 本文为Ising模型之间的f-散度近似提供了完整的计算复杂度刻画，算法与硬度结果在参数范围内匹配，且方法具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: The $f$-divergence is a fundamental notion that measures the difference
between two distributions. In this paper, we study the problem of approximating
the $f$-divergence between two Ising models, which is a generalization of
recent work on approximating the TV-distance. Given two Ising models $\nu$ and
$\mu$, which are specified by their interaction matrices and external fields,
the problem is to approximate the $f$-divergence $D_f(\nu\,\|\,\mu)$ within an
arbitrary relative error $\mathrm{e}^{\pm \varepsilon}$. For
$\chi^\alpha$-divergence with a constant integer $\alpha$, we establish both
algorithmic and hardness results. The algorithm works in a parameter regime
that matches the hardness result. Our algorithm can be extended to other
$f$-divergences such as $\alpha$-divergence, Kullback-Leibler divergence,
R\'enyi divergence, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and squared Hellinger distance.

Motivation: 研究在顶点带有唯一标签的有界度图模型中，哪些编号方案可以在亚线性时间内进行测试，特别是DFS遍历等图处理过程产生的编号。

Method: 扩展标准有界度图模型，允许算法查询顶点标签（但不能按标签查询顶点），开发了针对DFS遍历发现时间的属性测试算法。

Result: 提出了查询复杂度为O(n^{1/3}/ε)的DFS遍历发现时间测试算法，并对常数ε>0给出了匹配的下界。

Conclusion: 新模型为研究带标签图的属性测试提供了框架，DFS遍历发现时间测试算法展示了该模型的可行性，并建立了紧致的查询复杂度界限。

Abstract: Property Testing is a formal framework to study the computational power and
complexity of sampling from combinatorial objects. A central goal in standard
graph property testing is to understand which graph properties are testable
with sublinear query complexity. Here, a graph property P is testable with a
sublinear query complexity if there is an algorithm that makes a sublinear
number of queries to the input graph and accepts with probability at least 2/3,
if the graph has property P, and rejects with probability at least 2/3 if it is
$\varepsilon$-far from every graph that has property P.
  In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the bounded degree graph model.
In this variant, in addition to the standard representation of a bounded degree
graph, we assume that every vertex $v$ has a unique label num$(v)$ from $\{1,
\dots, |V|\}$, and in addition to the standard queries in the bounded degree
graph model, we also allow a property testing algorithm to query for the label
of a vertex (but not for a vertex with a given label).
  Our new model is motivated by certain graph processes such as a DFS
traversal, which assign consecutive numbers (labels) to the vertices of the
graph. We want to study which of these numberings can be tested in sublinear
time. As a first step in understanding such a model, we develop a
\emph{property testing algorithm for discovery times of a DFS traversal} with
query complexity $O(n^{1/3}/\varepsilon)$ and for constant $\varepsilon>0$ we
give a matching lower bound.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于全动态图的数据结构，能够高效地按需生成非平凡最小割稀疏化器，支持快速边更新操作，并应用于最小割仙人掌表示和最大k边连通子图计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全动态图环境中，需要高效地维护和查询非平凡最小割信息，传统方法难以在动态更新时快速提供最小割稀疏化器，因此需要开发新的数据结构来支持高效的更新和查询操作。

Method: 使用简单的动态森林数据结构，在查询时从头开始快速构建稀疏化器。根据对手强度和所需时间界限类型，提供不同的保证机制，包括最坏情况时间和摊销时间保证。

Result: 数据结构支持在n^o(1)最坏情况时间内完成边的插入/删除操作，能够以高概率返回具有O(n/δ)顶点和O(n)边的NMC稀疏化器，查询时间为Õ(n)。对于摊销时间保证或非自适应对手，更新和查询时间可进一步优化。

Conclusion: 该数据结构为全动态图提供了高效的NMC稀疏化器生成能力，成功应用于最小割仙人掌表示和最大k边连通子图计算，在k=Ω(n^{1/8})时实现了性能改进。

Abstract: A non-trivial minimum cut (NMC) sparsifier is a multigraph $\hat{G}$ that
preserves all non-trivial minimum cuts of a given undirected graph $G$. We
introduce a flexible data structure for fully dynamic graphs that can
efficiently provide an NMC sparsifier upon request at any point during the
sequence of updates. We employ simple dynamic forest data structures to achieve
a fast from-scratch construction of the sparsifier at query time. Based on the
strength of the adversary and desired type of time bounds, the data structure
comes with different guarantees. Specifically, let $G$ be a fully dynamic
simple graph with $n$ vertices and minimum degree $\delta$. Then our data
structure supports an insertion/deletion of an edge to/from $G$ in $n^{o(1)}$
worst-case time. Furthermore, upon request, it can return w.h.p. an NMC
sparsifier of $G$ that has $O(n/\delta)$ vertices and $O(n)$ edges, in
$\hat{O}(n)$ time. The probabilistic guarantees hold against an adaptive
adversary. Alternatively, the update and query times can be improved to
$\tilde{O}(1)$ and $\tilde{O}(n)$ respectively, if amortized-time guarantees
are sufficient, or if the adversary is oblivious.
  We discuss two applications of our data structure. First, it can be used to
efficiently report a cactus representation of all minimum cuts of a fully
dynamic simple graph. Using the NMC sparsifier we can w.h.p. build this cactus
in worst-case time $\hat{O}(n)$ against an adaptive adversary. Second, our data
structure allows us to efficiently compute the maximal $k$-edge-connected
subgraphs of undirected simple graphs, by repeatedly applying a minimum cut
algorithm on the NMC sparsifier. Specifically, we can compute w.h.p. the
maximal $k$-edge-connected subgraphs of a simple graph with $n$ vertices and
$m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m+n^2/k)$ time which is an improvement for $k =
\Omega(n^{1/8})$ and works for fully dynamic graphs.

TL;DR: REMOTE是一个统一的多模态关系抽取框架，通过多级最优传输和专家混合机制，能够同时提取文本实体和视觉对象之间的模态内和模态间关系，解决了现有方法只能提取单一类型关系三元组的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态关系抽取方法通常只能提取单一类型的关系三元组，无法处理超出指定类型的三元组。直接组合这些方法无法捕捉动态的跨模态交互，并引入显著的计算冗余。

Method: 提出REMOTE框架：1）使用专家混合机制动态选择不同关系三元组类型的最优交互特征；2）采用多级最优传输融合模块保留低级特征同时维持多层编码；3）创建统一多模态关系抽取数据集(UMRE)进行评估。

Result: 实验表明REMOTE能够有效提取各种类型的关系三元组，在两个公共MRE数据集上几乎所有指标都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: REMOTE框架通过统一的架构解决了多模态关系抽取中的类型限制问题，通过动态特征选择和特征保留机制实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of
Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge
graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to
extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability
to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these
methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces
significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel
Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can
simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual
entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features
for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts
mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.
Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential
encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,
we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level
features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive
representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation
Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from
either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively
extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art
performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We
release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大语言模型在建筑项目管理中的伦理判断存在显著缺陷，需人类监督，仅适合作为辅助决策工具


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在建筑项目管理这种高风险、伦理敏感领域的可靠性和伦理可行性

Method: 混合研究方法：量化测试两个领先LLMs在12个真实伦理场景中的表现，使用EDSAC评估检查单；质性分析12位专家访谈

Result: LLMs在法律遵循等结构化领域表现迅速，但在处理上下文细节、确保负责任和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷

Conclusion: LLMs目前仅适合作为决策支持工具，而非自主伦理判断者，必须强调人类在环中的监督作用

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和配置的holistic方法。

Method: Maestro框架联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示、工具等），利用反射性文本反馈来优先处理编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均领先MIPROv2 12%、GEPA 4.9%、GEPA+Merge 4.86%；即使仅限于提示优化，仍领先9.65%、2.37%、2.41%，且使用比GEPA更少的rollouts。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示调优无法解决的结构性故障模式，在多个实际应用中显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架来解决健康模拟模型解释的个性化需求问题，通过混合方法识别不同利益相关者的需求，并指导LLM生成定制化的解释输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的健康模拟模型虽然对决策支持有巨大潜力，但由于模型复杂性和通用化解释的局限性，无法满足不同利益相关者（临床医生、政策制定者、患者等）的个性化信息需求和风格偏好。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先收集不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后通过可控属性调优等方法优化LLM生成定制化输出的能力，最后通过综合指标评估来进一步改进定制化摘要生成。

Result: 论文提出了一个系统化的分步框架，但没有提供具体的实验结果数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为解决健康模拟模型解释的个性化需求提供了系统化的方法，有助于提高模型对不同利益相关者的可访问性和实用性。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型的发展是人工智能的关键瓶颈，特别是在复杂长期多满任务中。标准强化学习在高保真但结构平坦的模拟器中常常失败，因为探索空间过大且奖励稀疏。

Method: 提出使用大语言模型动态生成层次架构，将复杂目标分解为结构化的子目标。通过语言驱动的世界模型提供内在课程、密集有意义的学习信号和组合学习框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一种新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，使大语言模型具备主动思考能力，能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是反应当前条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型擅长被动处理信息，但缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，无法在行动前预测潜在后果，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景中的实用性。

Method: 整合假设分析方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态。在《王者荣耀》复杂游戏环境中进行验证。

Result: WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提高两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为显著。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了向主动推理的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XRL方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪些工具来理解RL策略。

Method: 采用五代理架构（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四罐过程控制问题上验证，成功高精度映射用户查询到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认有效解释代理行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架有效提升了RL策略的可解释性，通过多代理LLM协作提供自然语言解释，解决了XRL工具使用的复杂性问题。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 这是首次系统性地描述语言模型在长期合作行为中的特征，为未来研究混合人工智能社会环境中的模型角色奠定了基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，作为选择和聚合之间的关键中间层发挥了重要作用

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在GUI感知中存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低和推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出基于预训练MLLM的连续坐标建模方法，添加token路由器和坐标解码器；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准来系统评估GUI模型的结构感知能力。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续建模和拒绝机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在精度和速度方面都有显著提升，为GUI解析提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法，用于在缺乏全局透明网络的Web of Agents环境中实现基于性能的智能体排名，通过隐私保护的方式收集使用和性能数据，实现可信的智能体网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体的发展，互联网正在向'智能体网络'转型，但缺乏像PageRank那样的全局排名机制。使用信号分散且私有，需要协调机制来实现基于实际性能的智能体排名。

Method: 提出五层DOVIS协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集最小化隐私保护的使用和性能聚合数据，并开发AgentRank-UC算法，结合使用频率和性能指标（结果质量、成本、安全性、延迟）进行动态排名。

Result: 通过仿真实验和理论分析证明了该方法的收敛性、鲁棒性和抗Sybil攻击能力，展示了协调协议和性能感知排名在构建可扩展可信智能体网络中的可行性。

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为解决智能体网络中的排名问题提供了可行的技术方案，为构建机器原生的智能体生态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS是一个新颖的测试时扩展框架，通过协调三个协作的大型推理模型，利用历史经验进行迭代探索和优化解决方案，显著提高了计算效率和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽略了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试信息的方法来提高推理效率。

Method: 提出了Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的LRM模型，通过提取、精炼和重用关键信息（称为sticker）进行多轮推理。采用两阶段优化策略结合模仿学习和自我改进。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25和OlymMATH）上，Sticker-TTS在可比推理预算下 consistently超越了包括自一致性和先进强化学习方法在内的强基线。

Conclusion: Sticker-TTS通过sticker引导的历史经验利用，有效提高了大型推理模型的性能和计算效率，为测试时扩展提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS.

TL;DR: 提出功能性概念图（FCG）方法来解决创新者的认知固化问题，通过构建大规模、高质量的功能元素互连表示来支持抽象化、问题重构和类比启发


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创新者往往对现有解决方案或初步想法存在认知固化，这会阻碍对新替代方案的探索，需要一种方法来促进创新思维

Method: 构建功能性概念图（FCG）作为功能元素的互连表示，并提出MUSE算法利用FCG为给定问题生成创造性启发

Abstract: Innovators often exhibit cognitive fixation on existing solutions or nascent
ideas, hindering the exploration of novel alternatives. This paper introduces a
methodology for constructing Functional Concept Graphs (FCGs), interconnected
representations of functional elements that support abstraction, problem
reframing, and analogical inspiration. Our approach yields large-scale,
high-quality FCGs with explicit abstraction relations, overcoming limitations
of prior work. We further present MUSE, an algorithm leveraging FCGs to
generate creative inspirations for a given problem. We demonstrate our method
by computing an FCG on 500K patents, which we release for further research.

*Matteo Bortoletto,Yichao Zhou,Lance Ying,Tianmin Shu,Andreas Bulling*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标并提供针对性反馈，在多智能体环境中有效促进亲社会行为，相比现有大型语言模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中独立目标追求时如何适时有效协助他人的挑战，促进亲社会行为（即使与自身目标不完全一致但能惠及他人的行动）。

Method: ProToM系统：1）使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标；2）基于推断的目标分布，通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的针对性反馈。在两个多智能体环境（Doors, Keys, and Gems 以及 Overcooked）中进行评估。

Result: 现有大型语言和推理模型在提供上下文接地且时机恰当的反馈方面表现不足，导致更高的通信开销和任务加速效果差。ProToM提供有针对性的有用反馈，获得更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并持续受到人类用户偏好。

Conclusion: ProToM系统通过心理理论引导的针对性反馈，在多智能体协作中有效促进了亲社会行为，相比现有先进模型在反馈质量和时机把握方面表现更优。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为ODRL语言提供基于查询答处的正式语义学，并研究政策比较问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODRL已成为数字资源访问和使用管理的实际标准，但缺乏全面的正式语义学定义

Method: 提出基于查询答处的简单直观的正式语义学，精炼之前的形式化方法

Result: 形式语义与ODRL 2.2版本规范保持一致，并支持政策比较分析

Conclusion: 该方法为ODRL政策评估和比较提供了可靠的基础，特别适用于数据共享场景

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo
