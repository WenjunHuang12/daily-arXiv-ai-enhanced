To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer\nType-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates\nconsumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type\ntheory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and\nexpert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.\nsatisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction\nhistories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user\ntypes in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate\nuser types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that\ndynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query\ncomplexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like\nstrategies conditioned on consumer type.

We initiate the study of the sparsification of random CSPs. In\nparticular, we consider two natural random models: the $r$-partite model and\nthe uniform model. In the $r$-partite model, CSPs are formed by partitioning\nthe variables into $r$ parts, with constraints selected by randomly picking one\nvertex out of each part. In the uniform model, $r$ distinct vertices are chosen\nat random from the pool of variables to form each constraint.\n  In the $r$-partite model, we exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon.

Here, $k$ corresponds\nto the largest copy of the AND which can be found within $P$.

Moreover, current key-value (KV)\nseparated LSM-trees overlook the space amplification caused by the index\nLSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space\namplification in KV-separated LSM-trees and propose Scavenger+, which achieves\na better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an\nI/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a\nspace-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate\nindex-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts\nto system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Scavenger+ significantly improves write\nperformance and reduces space amplification compared to state-of-the-art\nKV-separated LSM-trees, including BlobDB, Titan, and TerarkDB."}

However, standard CP\ntreats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as\nsemantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper\npresents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that\nincorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of\nprediction sets.

Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes.

In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself.

To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round).

Prior work has used Subjective Logic\nto assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate\ntrustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a\nwhole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the\ntrustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations\nof global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach\nsupports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where\nevidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this\nframework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally\nevaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results\ndemonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable\nand robust in both centralized and federated contexts."}

This process is typically approached in two ways:\none-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and\niterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for\npotentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has\nhistorically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather\nthan rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and\ncomprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,\nbenchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying\ndifferent pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has\nspecific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning\nratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios.

Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions.

LEOPARD can learn from a\nbroad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn\nreward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited\namount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD\noutperforms existing baselines by a significant margin.

Although various algorithmic\napproaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large\nlanguage models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,\nsystematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics\npredominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting\nis computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific\nstrategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only\npredictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal\nstability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the\nclosed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders\nreproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we\npropose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation\nframework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall\nquality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive\npower, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and\ndiversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms\ndemonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to\ncomprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and\nhigher efficiency.

We identify an analogous issue, search-time\ncontamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to\ngather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs\nwhen the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a\nnear-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than\ngenuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that\nHuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among\nretrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often\nexplicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace\nwithin their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:\nHumanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for\napproximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets\nwith ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries\ntarget the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the\nbenchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace\nis blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of\napproximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly\naccessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of\nSTC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design\nand result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure\ntrustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents.

To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous\nknowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase\noptimization strategy.

The\ncalibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's\nprofile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the\nrecommendation list.
