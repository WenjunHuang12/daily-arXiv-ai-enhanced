Unlike traditional advertising, which allocates advertising slots exclusively to a single advertiser, joint advertising displays advertisements from brands and stores that have established a joint selling relationship within the same advertising slot. However, existing approaches often struggle to accommodate both joint and traditional advertising frameworks, thereby limiting the revenue potential and generalizability of joint advertising. Furthermore, these methods are constrained by two critical limitations: they generally neglect the influence of global externalities, and they fail to address the bidding variability stemming from multi-party advertiser participation. Collectively, these limitations present substantial challenges to the design of joint auction mechanisms. To address these challenges, we propose a Joint Auction Framework incorporating Externalities and Adaptation, and leverage the automated mechanism design (AMD) method through our proposed JEANet to compute joint auction mechanisms that satisfy the conditions of individual rationality (IR) and approximate dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). As the first AMD method to integrate global externalities into joint auctions, JEANet dynamically adapts to the bidding characteristics of multi-party advertiser and enables unified auctions that integrate both joint and traditional advertising. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that JEANet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in multi-slot joint auctions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faJEANet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u878d\u5165\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u62cd\u5356\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u7ade\u4ef7\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6536\u5165\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u6846\u67b6(JEANet)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5360\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6fc0\u52b1\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u673a\u5236", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eJEANet\u5728\u591a\u69fd\u4f4d\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u65b9\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u7ade\u4ef7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u62cd\u5356", "conclusion": "JEANet\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5916\u90e8\u6027\u878d\u5165\u8054\u5408\u62cd\u5356\u7684AMD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u62cd\u5356\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6536\u5165\u6f5c\u529b"}}

Applying this approach across many iterations, ensures that the solution evolves gradually and smoothly.\n  In this paper, we study the above problem in the context of clustering, specifically focusing on the $k$-center problem. More precisely, we study the following problem: Given a set of points $X$, parameters $k$ and $b$, and a prior clustering solution $H$ for $X$, our goal is to compute a new solution $C$ for $X$, consisting of $k$ centers, which minimizes the clustering cost while introducing at most $b$ changes from $H$.

We seek a path $P$ starting at $s$ and visiting all the clients so as to minimize the sum of client waiting times (also known as latency) before being visited on the path.\n  In contrast to the symmetric version of this problem (also known as the Deliveryperson problem and the Repairperson problem in the literature), there are significant gaps in our understanding of Directed Latency. The best approximation factor has remained at $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of clients, for more than a decade [Friggstad, Salavatipour, and Svitkina, '13]. Only recently, [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] presented a constant-factor approximation but in quasi-polynomial time. Both results follow similar ideas: they consider buckets with geometrically-increasing distances, build paths in each bucket, and then stitch together all these paths to get a feasible solution. [Friggstad and Swamy, '22] showed if we guess a vertex from each bucket and augment a standard LP relaxation with these guesses, then one can reduce the stitching cost. Unfortunately, there are logarithmically many buckets so the running time of their algorithm is quasi-polynomial.\n  In this paper, we present the first constant-factor approximation for Directed Latency in polynomial time by introducing a completely new way of bucketing which helps us strengthen a standard LP relaxation with less aggressive guessing. Although the resulting LP is no longer a relaxation of Directed Latency, it still admits a good solution. We present a rounding algorithm for fractional solutions of our LP, crucially exploiting the way we restricted the feasibility region of the LP formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6876\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684LP\u677e\u5f1b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6709\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff08Directed Latency\uff09\u4e0e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7248\u672c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u6700\u4f73\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u505c\u7559\u5728O(log n)\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u867d\u6709\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u62df\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6876\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236LP\u53ef\u884c\u57df\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u6807\u51c6LP\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7ed3\u679cLP\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u539f\u59cb\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u89e3\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u8be5LP\u5206\u6570\u89e3\u7684\u820d\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e38\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4e4b\u524dO(log n)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u62df\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e38\u6570\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6876\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53d7\u9650LP\u677e\u5f1b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6709\u5411\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e38\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

This paper introduces an approach for delivering content-level exploration safely and efficiently by optimizing its placement based on reach and opportunity cost. Deployed on a large-scale streaming platform with over 100 million monthly active users, our approach identifies scroll-depth regions with lower engagement and strategically introduces a dedicated container, the \"Something Completely Different\" row containing randomized content. Rather than enforcing exploration uniformly across the user interface (UI), we condition its appearance on empirically low-cost, high-reach positions to ensure minimal tradeoff against platform-level watch time goals. Extensive A/B testing shows that this strategy preserves business metrics while collecting unbiased interaction data. Our method complements existing intra-row diversification and bandit-based exploration techniques by introducing a deployable, behaviorally informed mechanism for surfacing exploratory content at scale.

However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u7684AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316SBL\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u6f14\u5316SBL\u4e24\u79cd\u79bb\u7f51\u683c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "AFDM\uff08\u4eff\u5c04\u9891\u5206\u590d\u7528\uff09\u662f\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u6ce2\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53cc\u5f25\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u79bb\u7f51\u683c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316SBL\uff08GR-SBL\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7f51\u683c\uff1b\u7f51\u683c\u6f14\u5316SBL\uff08GE-SBL\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u903c\u8fd1\u79bb\u7f51\u683c\u5206\u91cf\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u7f51\u683c\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u7ef4\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5c0f\u7ef4\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6848\u3002GR-SBL\u4ee5\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0cGE-SBL\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fD-GR-SBL\u548cD-GE-SBL\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eGR-SBL\u548cGE-SBL\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SBL\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\u4e3aAFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53cc\u5f25\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

A common task in this context is subsequence search, which involves identifying all MTS that contain subsequences highly similar to a query time series. In practical scenarios, not all channels of an MTS are relevant to every query. For instance, airplane sensors may gather data on a plethora of components and subsystems, but only a few of these are relevant to a specific query, such as identifying the cause of a malfunctioning landing gear, or a specific flight maneuver. Consequently, the relevant query channels are often specified at query time. In this work, we introduce the Multivariate Subsequence Index (MS-Index), a novel algorithm for nearest neighbor MTS subsequence search under Euclidean distance that supports ad-hoc selection of query channels. The algorithm is exact and demonstrates query performance that scales sublinearly to the number of query channels.

We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICAR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u50cf\u5168\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b020%\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff08175.33 GFLOPs\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u56fe\u50cf\u7b80\u5355\u8fd8\u662f\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8fd9\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1.

In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be \"detained\" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept \"information debt\" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a \"band fashion\" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u7801\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5bb9\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\uff08\u6bcf\u8df3\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u5305\u64e6\u9664\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u8df3\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728\u4e24\u8df3\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u5c06\"\u4fe1\u606f\u503a\u52a1\"\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e24\u8df3\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\"\u5e26\u72b6\"\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e73\u5747\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u5c06\u4e24\u8df3\u7ed3\u679c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u8df3\u6570\u7684\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u591a\u8df3\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u6d41\u7801\u7684\u968f\u673a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u9053\u6d41\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\"\u4fe1\u606f\u503a\u52a1\"\u6982\u5ff5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u8df3\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0b\u7684\u6d41\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

The results indicate that gamification is not universally effective, but rather requires a differentiated design to support engagement and inclusivity across the lifespan.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e74\u9f84\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e74\u9f84\u7fa4\u4f53\u3001\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e94\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u666e\u904d\u5ffd\u89c6\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u7279\u70b9\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u611f\u77e5\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5e74\u9f84\u7fa4\u4f53\u3001\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e94\u9879\u5e74\u9f84\u7279\u5b9a\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e74\u9f84-\u673a\u5236-\u6548\u679c\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e94\u9879\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e74\u9f84\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b57\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5168\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques.

Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \\(s(p)\\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \\(p\\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \\(\\max_{1\\le p\\le k} p\\,s^2(p)\\,\\log n\\), which matches the classical \\(k^2\\log n\\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \\(k\\log n\\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound.

VLDB Endow. (PVLDB), Vol. 19. 14 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "The search for suitable datasets is the critical \"first step\" in data-driven research, but it remains a great challenge. Researchers often need to search for datasets based on high-level task descriptions. However, existing search systems struggle with this task due to ambiguous user intent, task-to-dataset mapping and benchmark gaps, and entity ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce KATS, a novel end-to-end system for task-oriented dataset search from unstructured scientific literature. KATS consists of two key components, i.e., offline knowledge base construction and online query processing. The sophisticated offline pipeline automatically constructs a high-quality, dynamically updatable task-dataset knowledge graph by employing a collaborative multi-agent framework for information extraction, thereby filling the task-to-dataset mapping gap. To further address the challenge of entity ambiguity, a unique semantic-based mechanism is used for task entity linking and dataset entity resolution. For online retrieval, KATS utilizes a specialized hybrid query engine that combines vector search with graph-based ranking to generate highly relevant results. Additionally, we introduce CS-TDS, a tailored benchmark suite for evaluating task-oriented dataset search systems, addressing the critical gap in standardized evaluation.

Previous work on symbol detection in AmBC assumed perfect time synchronization (TS), which is unrealistic in practice. The residual TS errors (RTSE) cause \\emph{partial sample mismatch}, degrading symbol detection performance. To address this, we propose a new AmBC symbol detection framework that incorporates the BT's current and adjacent symbols, as well as channel coefficients. Using energy detector (ED) as a case study, we derive both exact and approximate bit error rate (BER) expressions. Our results show that the ED's BER performance degrades significantly under RTSE, with the symbol detection threshold optimized under the assumption of perfect TS. We then derive a closed-form expression for a near-optimal symbol detection threshold that minimizes BER under RTSE. To estimate the required parameters for the detection threshold, we propose a novel method exploiting the attributes of the BR's received signal samples.

The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network.

Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u5de5\u5382\u73af\u5883\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8c\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e09\u7ef4\u7684\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "1. \u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u5de5\u5382\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u7ed3\u5408\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u30022. \u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u697c\u5c42\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u697c\u5c42\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u6ce2\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9002\u5408\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u591a\u5c42\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u573a\u666f\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u591a\u5c42\u5efa\u7b51\u573a\u666f\u9002\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u4fe1\u9053\u56fe\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules.

Closed-form expressions of interferences in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain are derived by utilizing the stationary phase principle and the Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem, which indicates that interference impacts can be classified into stationary and non-stationary categories. On this basis, we reveal the analytical relationship between packet throughput and the paramerters of spread spectrum and error correction coding in our proposed anti-interference system, which enables the design of a parameter optimization algorithm that maximizes packet throughput. For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u4eff\u5c04\u9891\u5206\u590d\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u6076\u610f\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5305\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5206\u96c6\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bbe\u5907\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6076\u610f\u9ad8\u529f\u7387\u5e72\u6270\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u63a8\u5bfc\u79bb\u6563\u4eff\u5c04\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u57df\u4e2d\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u9891\u548c\u7ea0\u9519\u7f16\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u51fd\u6570\u548cAFDM\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5305\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6297\u5e72\u6270AFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u6076\u610f\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing artificial intelligence-based solutions often lack robustness and fail to generalize across scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a predictive-foundation-model-based channel estimation framework that enables accurate, low-overhead, and generalizable CSI acquisition. The proposed framework employs a predictive foundation model trained on large-scale cross-domain CSI data to extract universal channel representations and provide predictive priors with strong cross-scenario transferability. A pilot processing network based on a vision transformer architecture is further designed to capture spatial, temporal, and frequency correlations from pilot observations. An efficient fusion mechanism integrates predictive priors with real-time measurements, enabling reliable CSI reconstruction even under sparse or noisy conditions. Extensive evaluations across diverse configurations demonstrate that the proposed estimator significantly outperforms both classical and data-driven baselines in accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u57dfCSI\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f(CSI)\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u57dfCSI\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u4fe1\u9053\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bfc\u9891\u5904\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ece\u5bfc\u9891\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684CSI\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684CSI\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}
