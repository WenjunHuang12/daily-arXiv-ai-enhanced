SoulNet consists of three principal\ncomponents: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models\ncomplex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2)\nMusic-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units\ninto expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval\nModule, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance\nalignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence\nbetween generated dance and input music throughout the generation process.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing\napproaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned\nholistic 3D dance sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "SoulDance\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cSoulNet\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0e\u821e\u8e48\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u76843D\u821e\u8e48\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u4e50\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u821e\u8e48\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoulDance\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cSoulNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5206\u5c42\u6b8b\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u97f3\u4e50-\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "SoulNet\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u97f3\u4e50\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "SoulNet\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u5bf9\u9f50\u821e\u8e48\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While this problem has been widely studied in\ntraditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation\n(BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional\ncomplexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user\nsatisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and\nthe individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics\ndesigned for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this\nmulti-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive\nreproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world\ndatasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods.

We also find that\nfairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used,\nreinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation.

The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance\ncriteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with\nlarger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even\nif it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to\nchallenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each\nfilter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space.

RaMen utilizes both\nintrinsic (characteristics) and extrinsic (collaborative signals) information\nto model bundle structures through Explicit Strategy-aware Learning (ESL) and\nImplicit Strategy-aware Learning (ISL).

However, this static model\nselection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies\nbetween diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in\nsuboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill\nthe model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated\nmodel knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by\nadaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First,\nwe propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an\nadaptive query problem over task metadata.

Often, this uncertainty\narises from multiple sources, e.g., incomplete information, limited\ncomputation, bounded rationality. While it may be possible to guide the agents'\ndecisions by modeling each source, their joint presence makes this task\nparticularly daunting. Toward this goal, it is natural for agents to seek\nprotection against deviations around the emergent behavior itself, which is\nultimately impacted by all the above sources of uncertainty. To do so, we\npropose that each agent takes decisions in face of the worst-case behavior\ncontained in an ambiguity set of tunable size, centered at the emergent\nbehavior so implicitly defined. This gives rise to a novel equilibrium notion,\nwhich we call strategically robust equilibrium. Building on its definition, we\nshow that, when judiciously operationalized via optimal transport,\nstrategically robust equilibria (i) are guaranteed to exist under the same\nassumptions required for Nash equilibria; (ii) interpolate between Nash and\nsecurity strategies; (iii) come at no additional computational cost compared to\nNash equilibria. Through a variety of experiments, including bi-matrix games,\ncongestion games, and Cournot competition, we show that strategic robustness\nprotects against uncertainty in the opponents' behavior and, surprisingly,\noften results in higher equilibrium payoffs - an effect we refer to as\ncoordination via robustification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u6218\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u8c03\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u9700\u8981\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u5982\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6218\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u5185\u8003\u8651\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u96c6\u4ee5\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5747\u8861\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u6218\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u5747\u8861\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5bf9\u624b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5747\u8861\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6218\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u5747\u8861\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u5e94\u3002"}}

Traditional\npredictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that\nfail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data.

Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN\nclinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting\ndaily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented\nwith a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a\nCombined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset\nincluded behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features.\nExperiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream\ncombinations.

Results: The CM outperformed both RF and\nLinear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985\nvs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed\nsigns of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance,\nwhile the CM maintained consistent generalization.

Both analytical formulas\nand simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ\nunder strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ\nmethod exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming\nespecially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of\njamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle\nmultiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also\ninvestigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with\ndifferent coherence times.

This paper\nintroduces the concept of Predictive Representativity (PR), a framework of\nfairness auditing that shifts the focus from the composition of the data set to\noutcomes-level equity. Through a case study in dermatology, we evaluated\nAI-based skin cancer classifiers trained on the widely used HAM10000 dataset\nand on an independent clinical dataset (BOSQUE Test set) from Colombia. Our\nanalysis reveals substantial performance disparities by skin phototype, with\nclassifiers consistently underperforming for individuals with darker skin,\ndespite proportional sampling in the source data. We argue that\nrepresentativity must be understood not as a static feature of datasets but as\na dynamic, context-sensitive property of model predictions. PR operationalizes\nthis shift by quantifying how reliably models generalize fairness across\nsubpopulations and deployment contexts. We further propose an External\nTransportability Criterion that formalizes the thresholds for fairness\ngeneralization. Our findings highlight the ethical imperative for post-hoc\nfairness auditing, transparency in dataset documentation, and inclusive model\nvalidation pipelines.

However, research in this area is\nstill in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,\nquality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In\nthis paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of\nsolutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by\nsaliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each\ntile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and\nmultiple quality levels for adaptive selection.

We seek the optimal\ncombination of phase shifts across all the meta-atoms to maximize the channel\nstrength from transmitter to receiver. Unlike many existing works that heavily\nrely on channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a statistical\napproach to the phase shift optimization in the absence of CSI, namely blind\nconfiguration or zero-order optimization. The main idea is to extract the key\nfeatures of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS)\ndata via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a\nwindfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a\nnontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active\nsensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel\nestimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless\ncommunication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is\nthe RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is\nverified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band.

These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks\nover time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical\nand research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning\nand optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated\nframework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine\ndeep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking\nacross diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes\na graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality\ntraining data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a\nnovel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency\nframe-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack\ndemonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point\ntrackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its\npotential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical\nresearch.

We consider scenarios\nin which agents' active days differ, leading to dynamic states as agents drop\nout of the decision process. To address this problem from different\nperspectives, we define three distinct competitive ratios: overall,\nstate-dependent, and individual rational.

Our deterministic\npolicies employ state-aware threshold functions that adapt to the dynamic\nstates, while our randomized policies sample and resample thresholds from\ntailored state-aware distributions. The analysis reveals that symmetric\npolicies, in which all agents use the same threshold, outperform asymmetric\nones.

A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score\nfunctions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low\nscores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these\nmethods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their\nefficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased\ndistribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These\nextreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores\nto ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods.

A fundamental assumption of multi-behavior recommendation\nmethods is the existence of shared user preferences across behaviors,\nrepresenting users' intrinsic interests. Based on this assumption, existing\napproaches aim to integrate information from various behaviors to enrich user\nrepresentations. However, they often overlook the presence of both\ncommonalities and individualities in users' multi-behavior preferences.

To address this issue, we propose a user\ninvariant preference learning for multi-behavior recommendation (UIPL for\nshort), aiming to capture users' intrinsic interests (referred to as invariant\npreferences) from multi-behavior interactions to mitigate the introduction of\nnoise. Specifically, UIPL leverages the paradigm of invariant risk minimization\nto learn invariant preferences. To implement this, we employ a variational\nautoencoder (VAE) to extract users' invariant preferences, replacing the\nstandard reconstruction loss with an invariant risk minimization constraint.\nAdditionally, we construct distinct environments by combining multi-behavior\ndata to enhance robustness in learning these preferences.

We find that quantifying the uncertainty\nof a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an\neffective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3\n235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring\n7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them\nchallenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this\nchallenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning\nmodel. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system \"Fail Fast, or Ask\",\nsince the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert\ndirectly (\"failing fast\"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher\nlatency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and\nabout 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the\naccuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower\nthan expected because of \"latency drag\", the phenomenon that processing easier\nqueries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency\ndistribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the\ndeficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and\nhigh latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems\nengineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u9009\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff0cAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9700\u63a5\u8fd10%\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u9ad8\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u4ea4\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u7b5b\u9009\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u4ea4\u4eba\u7c7b\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4ece3%\u964d\u81f31%\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u8282\u770150%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630190%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Therefore, there is\na pressing need to devise cutting-edge retrieval strategies that can reliably\nachieve the desired recall. This study introduces FullRecall, a novel patent\nretrieval approach that effectively manages the complexity of patent data while\nmaintaining the reliability of relevance matching and maximising recall. It\nleverages IPC-guided knowledge to generate informative phrases, which are\nprocessed to extract key information in the form of noun phrases characterising\nthe query patent under observation. From these, the top k keyphrases are\nselected to construct a query for retrieving a focused subset of the dataset.\nThis initial retrieval step achieves complete recall, successfully capturing\nall relevant documents. To further refine the results, a ranking scheme is\napplied to the retrieved subset, reducing its size while maintaining 100%\nrecall. This multi-phase process demonstrates an effective strategy for\nbalancing precision and recall in patent retrieval tasks. Comprehensive\nexperiments were conducted, and the results were compared with baseline\nstudies, namely HRR2 [1] and ReQ-ReC [2].

Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but\ndeep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection\noverhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to\nadversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam\nalignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)\nsystems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements\nfrom wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of\nexhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data\ncollection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate\nsynthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model\nrefinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model\nresiding in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging\nmismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce\nbeam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep\nShapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance,\nprioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also\nincorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a\ncredibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring\nrobust, transparent decision-making.

However,\ntraditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training\ndata and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally,\nthe cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire.\nMeanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the\nmodel's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a\nsemi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual\ncontrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for\ndistributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy.\nIt enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and\nfacilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving\nmutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically,\nfirst, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is\ndesigned to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the\nsemi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced\nto mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising\nlocal contrastive loss and global contrastive loss.

The heterogeneity in these data\nand the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the\nmodeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the\npotential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through\nempirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic\nrelationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances\ntrend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we\npropose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified\nframework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual\nsignals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces\nnaturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation.

As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

Conventional filtering algorithms often rely on\nthe selection of the filtering window, limiting their applicability in certain\nscenarios. To this end, we propose a novel Two-Dimensional Smoothing (TDS)\nalgorithm for the smoothing and filtering problem of two-dimensional sequences.\nTypically, the TDS algorithm does not require assumptions about the type of\nnoise distribution. It is simple and easy to implement compared to conventional\nfiltering methods, such as 2D adaptive Wiener filtering and Gaussian filtering.\nThe TDS algorithm can effectively extract the trend contained in the\ntwo-dimensional sequence and reduce the influence of noise on the data by\nadjusting only a single parameter. In this work, unlike existing algorithms\nthat depend on the filtering window, we introduce a loss function, where the\ntrend sequence is identified as the solution when this loss function takes a\nminimum value. Therefore, within the framework of the TDS algorithm, a general\ntwo-dimensional sequence can be innovatively decomposed into a trend sequence\nand a fluctuation sequence, in which the trend sequence contains the main\nfeatures of the sequence and the fluctuation sequence contains the detailed\nfeatures or noise interference of the sequence. To ensure the reliability of\nthe TDS algorithm, a crucial lemma is first established, indicating that the\ntrend sequence and fluctuation sequence obtained by the TDS algorithm are\nexistent and unique when the global smoothing parameter is determined. Three\nmodified algorithms are then proposed based on the TDS algorithm, with\ncorresponding lemmas and corollaries demonstrating their reliability.

Multi-behavior\nrecommendation algorithms aim to leverage various auxiliary user behaviors to\nenhance prediction for target behaviors of primary interest (e.g., buy),\nthereby overcoming performance limitations caused by data sparsity in target\nbehavior records. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically employ\nhierarchical design following either cascading (e.g.,\nview$\\rightarrow$cart$\\rightarrow$buy) or parallel\n(unified$\\rightarrow$behavior$\\rightarrow$specific components) paradigms, to\ncapture behavioral relationships. However, these methods still face two\ncritical challenges: (1) severe distribution disparities across behaviors, and\n(2) negative transfer effects caused by noise in auxiliary behaviors. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model-agnostic Hierarchical Graph Information\nBottleneck (HGIB) framework for multi-behavior recommendation to effectively\naddress these challenges. Following information bottleneck principles, our\nframework optimizes the learning of compact yet sufficient representations that\npreserve essential information for target behavior prediction while eliminating\ntask-irrelevant redundancies. To further mitigate interaction noise, we\nintroduce a Graph Refinement Encoder (GRE) that dynamically prunes redundant\nedges through learnable edge dropout mechanisms.

We further extend it\nto one billion parameters with a Sparse-MoE variant for higher ROI. A dynamic\nrouting strategy is adapted to address the inadequacy and imbalance of experts\ntraining.

Traditionally, developers estimate story points\ncollaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the\ninitial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team\nhas converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious\nand labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with\nenough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is,\nstate-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate\npredictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The\ngoal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a\ncomparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story\npoint prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to\nevery backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate\nwhich item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine\nlearning model is trained to predict the story point estimates.

A recent line of work has studied the\nnatural problem of learning when observing an evolution of the well-known\nGlauber dynamics [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2018,\nGaitonde, Mossel STOC 2024], which provides an arguably more realistic\ngenerative model than the classical i.i.d. setting. However, this prior work\ncrucially assumes that all site update attempts are observed, \\emph{even when\nthis attempt does not change the configuration}: this strong observation model\nis seemingly essential for these approaches. While perhaps possible in\nrestrictive contexts, this precludes applicability to most realistic settings\nwhere we can observe \\emph{only} the stochastic evolution itself, a minimal and\nnatural assumption for any process we might hope to learn from. However,\ndesigning algorithms that succeed in this more realistic setting has remained\nan open problem [Bresler, Gamarnik, Shah, IEEE Trans. Inf.

We show that our adaptive agent successfully learns\nsuperior policies across diverse scenarios, including a ``Krum-favorable\"\nenvironment and against a sophisticated \"stealth\" adversary designed to\nneutralize specific diagnostic signals. Critically, we analyze the paradoxical\nscenario where a non-robust baseline achieves high but compromised accuracy,\nand demonstrate that our agent learns a conservative policy to prioritize model\nintegrity. Furthermore, we prove the agent's policy is controllable via a\nsingle \"risk tolerance\" parameter, allowing practitioners to explicitly manage\nthe trade-off between performance and security.

Recently the pandemic has left the whole\nworld shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have\nbecome essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent\nstudies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign\nover typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser\nextension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for\neveryone else in the video call.

Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often\nsuffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to\nhigh data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent\nresearch has explored modeling causal relationships among system components.\nHowever, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches\nthat require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time\nsettings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability\nto adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the\nrisk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live\nsystems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework\nfor incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack\ndetection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by\nincrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The\nframework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects\ntransitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions\nacross sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning:\nLeverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal\nstructures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification:\nEmploys Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the\nlearned causal graphs.

An Analysis of Simple Test-Time Scaling", "comment": null, "summary": "Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this\nscaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually\ncontrolling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum\nlength or scaling up by iteratively appending \"Wait\" when the model is about to\nterminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time\nscaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling\ndown by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data\ndistilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,\nand scaling up by appending \"Wait\" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may\noscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by\nenforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1\\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much\ncompute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported\nlength. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during\nreinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when\nscaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower\nupper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the\ntest-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,\nit is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to\nunlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --\nrather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u52a0'Wait'\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8ffd\u52a0'Wait'\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eo1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u9650\u5236\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea6\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u8ffd\u52a0'Wait'\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002o1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u80fd\u6a21\u62df\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800co1\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u7f29\u653e\u89e3\u9501\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u5e94\u662f\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u59cb\u6027\u80fd\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u590d\u5236\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Additionally, we design a class-aware\ndecomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes\nand further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned\noptimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the\ndifferential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively\nbridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning\nprocess.

To\naddress this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel\nintrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's\ninfluence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned\ndistribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the\nbaseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward\nthat isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise.\nWe test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where\ncorrelation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is\nsubjected to external forces.

The framework operates\nin two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that\nleverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.\n  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310\nimages, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final\nvalidation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training\ndata to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's\nFast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the\nHDRT-driven Standard Mode.

The\nSegment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a\nstreaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new\nopportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting\nthese models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets\nfor retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and\nthe risk of catastrophic forgetting.

This design enables effective\nfine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data.

When\ntreatment assignment is random, the average treatment effect (ATE) can be\nestimated directly by comparing outcomes between groups. In non-randomized\nsettings, various techniques are employed to adjust for confounding and\napproximate the counterfactual scenario to recover an unbiased ATE. A common\nchallenge, especially in observational studies, is the absence of units clearly\nlabeled as controls-that is, units known not to have received the treatment. To\naddress this, we propose positive-unlabeled (PU) learning as a framework for\nidentifying, with high confidence, control units from a pool of unlabeled ones,\nusing only the available treated (positive) units. We evaluate this approach\nusing both simulated and real-world data. We construct a causal graph with\ndiverse relationships and use it to generate synthetic data under various\nscenarios, assessing how reliably the method recovers control groups that allow\nestimates of true ATE. We also apply our approach to real-world data on optimal\nsowing and fertilizer treatments in sustainable agriculture. Our findings show\nthat PU learning can successfully identify control (negative) units from\nunlabeled data based only on treated units and, through the resulting control\ngroup, estimate an ATE that closely approximates the true value.

Addressing these\nissues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed\nMS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving\nefficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction\nmechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch\ninherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information\nwith cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter\nbranch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain\ncross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing\nin SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing\nmultispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy\nboth functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive\nexperiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our\nMS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object\ndetection methods, evidencing its superiority.

Companion code and\n  reproducibility materials available", "summary": "The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such\nas Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational\nprinciple: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how\ninformation flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of\nself-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural\nlanguage processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an\naffinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)\nas a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based\nweighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS\ndefines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature\nrelevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this\nperspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a\nsingle-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token\nsimilarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise\nrelationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie\nin how the affinity matrix is defined and applied.

However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing\napproaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values,\nwhich becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments.\nSpecifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm,\nexacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the\nenvironment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in\nvalue functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative\nmethods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to\nride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to\neliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired\nby GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO\nframework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet,\nthe optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we\nterm One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO).

In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a\nteacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot\nabilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation\nRecognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt\nDistillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal\nknowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to\nrecognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.\nSpecifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental\nRationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze\nrationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed\nscene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align\nrationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the\nNegative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively\ncapturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned\nmultimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a\nstronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,\nbridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction\nbias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving\nsuperior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further\ndemonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMIPD\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u84b8\u998f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u63a5\u5730\u60c5\u5883\u8bc6\u522b\uff08Ov-GSR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a5\u5730\u60c5\u5883\u8bc6\u522b\uff08GSR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edfGSR\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMIPD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u5224\u65ad\u6027\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ov-SWiG\u548cHICO-DET\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMIPD\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u3001\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u672a\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MIPD\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches\nreduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching\npolicy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each\nbatch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching\npolicies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing\neffort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts\nfrom a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates\nalternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics.\nEach heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching\npolicy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or\nresource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching\npolicy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via\nsimulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization\nmeta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto\nfront of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three\nmeta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement\nlearning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on\nintervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics\nbaseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of\nPareto-optimal policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6d3b\u52a8\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\uff08\u722c\u5c71\u6cd5\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u9000\u706b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e72\u9884\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u76ca\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e72\u9884\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7ed3\u5408\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to\nminority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor\nlatent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection\nperformance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention\nClassifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware\nclustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based\nattention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN\nallowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample\naugmentation.

To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience.

Specifically, trainable activation functions defined as ratios of\npolynomials (rational functions) have been proposed to enhance plasticity in\nreinforcement learning. However, their impact on training stability remains\nunclear. In this work, we study trainable rational activations in both\nreinforcement and continual learning settings. We find that while their\nflexibility enhances adaptability, it can also introduce instability, leading\nto overestimation in RL and feature collapse in longer continual learning\nscenarios. Our main result is demonstrating a trade-off between expressivity\nand plasticity in rational activations. To address this, we propose a\nconstrained variant that structurally limits excessive output scaling while\npreserving adaptability. Experiments across MetaWorld and DeepMind Control\nSuite (DMC) environments show that our approach improves training stability and\nperformance. In continual learning benchmarks, including MNIST with reshuffled\nlabels and Split CIFAR-100, we reveal how different constraints affect the\nbalance between expressivity and long-term retention.

Recently developed foundational models\nfor 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction\n(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry\nGrounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to\nhandle very sparse image overlaps.

For redundant collections, they can\naccelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite\ntests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric\naerial blocks remains unexplored.

To address the\nchallenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual\ntask Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target\nimage pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of\nlow-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing\nbackbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible\nintegration with various architectures and effective utilization of\ntask-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a\nunified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across\nmultiple representative tasks.

In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical\nExamination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we\ncompared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across\n60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality\nintake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the\noverseeing PCP to review.

The intricate interactions among\nintelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional\ncausal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer\nnew possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT)\nreasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain\nlimited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework:\nEmergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic\nand interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective\nthought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract\nagent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means\nclustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by\na Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments\nvalidate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the\nStanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its\neffectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency.

To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal\nframework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports\nwith high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and\nrespiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in\ncritically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision\nencoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through\ninterpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at\neach hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a\nretrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy\nin forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became\nradiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds\nsignificant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions\nlike acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial\nand diagnoses are often delayed.

However, the\nhigh-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,\nwhich makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there\nis a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly\nused for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.\nFirst, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to\nlearn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality\nof the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,\nexisting methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding\nannotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in\nsupervised training.

In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

We also identify an\nentropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may\nprogressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet\nunderrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while\nRLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally\noutweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,\nfailing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base\nmodel.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP\nfor 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D\nencoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for\nfeature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training\ninefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal\nnetwork to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),\nsignificantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal\nmodel with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the\ntri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across\nmodalities.

We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that\nleverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to\nestimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.\nWe express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit\nvector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the\nconcept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common\nline estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM\nprojection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary\ncomponents: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based\non an $\\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously\nestimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm\nand orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an\niterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane\ntranslations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches\nhave leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation\nrecovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\\ell_2$-based objectives\nthat are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only\napproximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,\ncan lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR\nregimes.

Several deep learning-based models have been developed to\nidentify such users. These models should not only accurately detect bad actors,\nbut also be robust against adversarial attacks that aim to evade detection.\nHowever, past deep learning-based detection models do not meet the robustness\nrequirement because they are sensitive to even minor changes in the input\nsequence. To address this issue, we focus on (1) improving the model\nunderstanding capability and (2) enhancing the model knowledge such that the\nmodel can recognize potential input modifications when making predictions. To\nachieve these goals, we create a novel transformer-based classification model,\ncalled ROBAD (RObust adversary-aware local-global attended Bad Actor Detection\nmodel), which uses the sequence of user posts to generate user embedding to\ndetect bad actors. Particularly, ROBAD first leverages the transformer encoder\nblock to encode each post bidirectionally, thus building a post embedding to\ncapture the local information at the post level. Next, it adopts the\ntransformer decoder block to model the sequential pattern in the post\nembeddings by using the attention mechanism, which generates the sequence\nembedding to obtain the global information at the sequence level. Finally, to\nenrich the knowledge of the model, embeddings of modified sequences by mimicked\nattackers are fed into a contrastive-learning-enhanced classification layer for\nsequence prediction. In essence, by capturing the local and global information\n(i.e., the post and sequence information) and leveraging the mimicked behaviors\nof bad actors in training, ROBAD can be robust to adversarial attacks.\nExtensive experiments on Yelp and Wikipedia datasets show that ROBAD can\neffectively detect bad actors when under state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aROBAD\u7684\u65b0\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u8005\u65f6\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "ROBAD\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6355\u6349\u5e16\u5b50\u7ea7\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728Yelp\u548cWikipedia\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cROBAD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ROBAD\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u6349\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial\ncorrection to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal\ncontrol law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge\ntheory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust\nActor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating\nits effectiveness in stabilizing training.

It also integrates adaptive processing to\noptimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining\ncompetitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100\nshow that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable\nreal-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,\nuncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven\nenvironmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,\nWaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing\nefficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By\naddressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to\nsustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation\nefforts.

Building\nupon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed\nmodules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency.

These\nmatrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating\nmisalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face\nembeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a\nglobal content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a\ndistribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal\nlayers while preserving ID via distribution alignment.

Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique\nchallenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude\ndatasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational\nambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a\nlarge-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,\nsystematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a\ndecade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured\ndesign ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training\nfor aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,\nleveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,\norientation-invariant feature representations.

Progress requires us to address\na number of translational issues, including sample efficiency, training time,\nand minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to\nchanging brain activity. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to\naddress these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of\nexcitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to\nprovide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of\noptogenetic stimulation on local field potentials (LFPs) measured in two\nnon-human primates. We further use simulations to demonstrate the use of TBF\nmodels for closed-loop stimulation, driving neural activity towards target\npatterns. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient, rapid\nto train (2-4min), and low latency (0.2ms) on desktop CPUs. We demonstrate the\nmodel on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation\ndata.

Additionally, developing generalist agents that\ncan adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging\nthese reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while\nintrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or\nuncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged\nby dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and\naction spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the\nunprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or\ncontrol the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can\neffectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and\nimperfect.

For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds\na state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to\noptimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior).

Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank\nregression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update\nstep from data.

To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of\nActive Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that\ncharacterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,\ncoverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies.

This\nstudy assessed the added value of conventional radiomics (CR) and deep learning\n(DL) MRI radiomics for glioblastoma prognosis (<= 6 vs > 6 months survival) on\na large multi-center dataset.\n  Methods: After patient selection, our curated dataset gathers 1152\nglioblastoma (WHO 2016) patients from five Swiss centers and one public source.\nIt included clinical (age, gender), molecular (MGMT, IDH), and baseline MRI\ndata (T1, T1 contrast, FLAIR, T2) with tumor regions.

This paper\nexplores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation\nof satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland\nUniversity, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven\nalgorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for\ntwo crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In\nthe routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the\nend-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming\nclassical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the\nscheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using\nlimited resources such as battery and memory.

Existing methods address\nthis challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge\nbeyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions\ninvolving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen\nclasses. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization.

The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to\nempower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous\ndriving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and\ntime-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of\nlow-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In\npractice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of\ncomputing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the\nheterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across\ndevices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework\nfor optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency\nwhile ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental\nC$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically,\nincreasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and\nthus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but\nresults in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of\nlatency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an\naccurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted\nto real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored\nto scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device\nheterogeneity.

In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be\nparameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end\nframework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable\nheuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing\ntrajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.\nExperiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing\nAgent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across\nsource and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across\nunseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.\nDirect application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability\nacross target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned\nheuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior\nmodel performance with less source-field data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6Data Mixing Agent\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3Data Mixing Agent\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Data Mixing Agent\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These challenges are\nparticularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,\nhigh altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To\novercome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel\nscene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We\nintroduce $\\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework\nthat follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting\nthe rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian\nprimitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate\npartitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic\nmemory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse\nstage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy\nand landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,\nand (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine\ndense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.\nThrough comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real\nflight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive\nlocalization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while\neffectively filtering unreliable pose estimates.

Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved\nsignificant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a\nkey concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA\nmethod that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,\nour method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and\ndistilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher\nmodel, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first\ntrain the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate\npseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are\nused in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to\ncombine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model\nthrough self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further\npseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.\nThe student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,\npseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled\nimages from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an\nextremely low computational overhead.

Although this task\nhas seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing\nstronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific\ncomparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation\nparadigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to\nperformance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches\nbecome lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways\nacross generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop\ntransformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the\nliterature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on\nImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.\nFirst, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and\nperformant baseline approach for transformers.

In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nis a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently\noccurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a\npenalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find\ntask-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic\nfew-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA\nand then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base\norgans and novel organs.

Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design\nprinciple for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new\nperspectives for future tokenizer design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLatent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok)\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5e72\u51c0\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5c5e\u6027\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fal-DeTok\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4ece\u88ab\u63d2\u503c\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u4e0a\uff0cl-DeTok\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u566a\u662f\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}
