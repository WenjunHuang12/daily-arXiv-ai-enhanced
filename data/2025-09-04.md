TL;DR: Simulacra Naturae是一个数据驱动的媒体装置，通过生物计算、材料生态和生成系统的融合探索集体关怀，将脑类器官的神经活动转化为多感官环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过非人类认知塑造的感官场域，重新构想可视化作为关怀实践，在混合计算系统中开辟伦理、共情和生态协调的新空间。

Method: 使用预记录的脑类器官神经活动，通过实时系统转化为生成视觉、空间音频、活体植物和人工陶艺品的多感官环境，采用基于自然系统（如白蚁群落和粘菌）的涌现代理行为。

Result: 创建了一个由非人类认知塑造的感官环境，将抽象数据根植于活体材料和具身体验中，实现了去中心化的人类代理。

Conclusion: 该作品通过生物计算与生成系统的融合，成功地将神经活动作为共同创造力量，为混合计算系统中的伦理和生态关怀提供了新的实践框架。

Abstract: Simulacra Naturae is a data-driven media installation that explores
collective care through the entanglement of biological computation, material
ecologies, and generative systems. The work translates pre-recorded neural
activity from brain organoids, lab-grown three-dimensional clusters of neurons,
into a multi-sensory environment composed of generative visuals, spatial audio,
living plants, and fabricated clay artifacts. These biosignals, streamed
through a real-time system, modulate emergent agent behaviors inspired by
natural systems such as termite colonies and slime molds. Rather than using
biosignals as direct control inputs, Simulacra Naturae treats organoid activity
as a co-creative force, allowing neural rhythms to guide the growth, form, and
atmosphere of a generative ecosystem. The installation features computationally
fabricated clay prints embedded with solenoids, adding physical sound
resonances to the generative surround composition. The spatial environment,
filled with live tropical plants and a floor-level projection layer featuring
real-time generative AI visuals, invites participants into a sensory field
shaped by nonhuman cognition. By grounding abstract data in living materials
and embodied experience, Simulacra Naturae reimagines visualization as a
practice of care, one that decentralizes human agency and opens new spaces for
ethics, empathy, and ecological attunement within hybrid computational systems.

*Liang Xie,Wenke Huang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 自动化生成高精度车道级模拟路网，通过深度学习车道线检测和地图匹配等技术，减少人工编辑成本和数据收集需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车道级模拟路网生成方法需要大规模数据收集和人工后期编辑，劳动密集、资源消耗大且成本高

Method: 收集开源街景数据构建车道线数据集，设计端到端深度学习车道线检测模型，结合坐标变换和地图匹配算法融合车道信息与路网拓扑

Result: 实现了高精度车道级模拟路网的全自动生成，显著降低了数据收集和人工编辑成本

Conclusion: 该方法提高了模拟路网生成效率和准确性，为城市交通模拟、自动驾驶导航等领域提供了可靠数据支持，为大规模城市路网自动建模提供新技术路径

Abstract: Existing lane-level simulation road network generation is labor-intensive,
resource-demanding, and costly due to the need for large-scale data collection
and manual post-editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose
automatically generating high-precision simulated road networks in traffic
scenario, an efficient and fully automated solution. Initially, real-world road
street view data is collected through open-source street view map platforms,
and a large-scale street view lane line dataset is constructed to provide a
robust foundation for subsequent analysis. Next, an end-to-end lane line
detection approach based on deep learning is designed, where a neural network
model is trained to accurately detect the number and spatial distribution of
lane lines in street view images, enabling automated extraction of lane
information. Subsequently, by integrating coordinate transformation and map
matching algorithms, the extracted lane information from street views is fused
with the foundational road topology obtained from open-source map service
platforms, resulting in the generation of a high-precision lane-level
simulation road network. This method significantly reduces the costs associated
with data collection and manual editing while enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of simulation road network generation. It provides reliable data
support for urban traffic simulation, autonomous driving navigation, and the
development of intelligent transportation systems, offering a novel technical
pathway for the automated modeling of large-scale urban road networks.

TL;DR: 程序员在利润与安全问题上常选择利润，媒体报道可通过损害品牌形象来促进AI安全发展，但需要供应高质量信息和控制成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究媒体报道是否能够促进AI创造者生产安全产品，实现AI技术的普遍采用

Method: 通过进化游戏理论研究自利创造者和用户的人工群体，分析媒体报道影响

Result: 媒体确实能够促进创造者与用户合作，但需要可靠的信息质量和合理的成本控制

Conclusion: 媒体作为架空监管机制，可以在没有正式政府监管的情况下形成公众认知和负责任制约，促进AI安全发展

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

Abstract: This community paper developed out of the NSF Workshop on the Future of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS),
which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of
AI+MPS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VLWM是一个基于视觉语言的世界模型，通过语言建模和双系统规划（系统1反应式解码和系统2反思式成本最小化规划）在自然视频上实现先进的视觉规划性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高层次世界模型在理解和推理具有语义和时间抽象的动作方面仍然不足，需要开发能够进行有效规划的世界模型

Method: 使用LLM自优化提取目标，学习动作策略和动态模型，通过双系统规划（系统1反应式解码和系统2成本最小化规划）进行视觉规划

Result: 在VPA基准测试和PlannerArena人工评估中达到最先进性能，系统2比系统1Elo得分提升27%，在RoboVQA和WorldPrediction基准上也优于强VLM基线

Conclusion: VLWM通过语言基础的世界建模和双系统规划框架，有效提升了视觉规划能力，为构建强大的世界模型提供了新方向

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的AI驱动数据分析运行时，结合了语义运算符的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，通过让Deep Research组件编写和执行优化的语义运算符程序来提高性能和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的语义运算符在大规模数据集上执行成本高且不适合交互式分析，而Deep Research系统缺乏查询计划优化导致性能差。需要一种新的运行时来结合两者优势。

Method: 构建了一个原型系统，让Deep Research组件能够编写和执行经过优化的语义运算符程序，将灵活的自然语言处理与高效的数据转换相结合。

Result: 在两个基础查询中，该原型系统超过了手工编写的语义运算符程序和开源Deep Research系统，与标准Deep Research组件相比F1分数提高了1.95倍，成本和运行时间节省了最76.8%和72.7%。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI驱动的数据分析提供了一种有前景的方向，通过结合语义运算符的优化执行和Deep Research系统的灵活性，能够在保持高效的同时提供更好的分析结果。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域的突破启发了其在结构相似的自动驾驶运动生成领域的应用，但缺乏对哪些LLM模块真正可迁移的系统性理解。

Method: 通过全面评估五个关键LLM模块（分词器设计、位置编码、预训练范式、后训练策略和测试时计算）在自动驾驶运动生成场景中的适应性，并进行大量实验验证。

Conclusion: 研究确定了可有效迁移的技术，分析了其他技术失败的原因，并讨论了自动驾驶场景所需的具体适配方法，为LLM在自动驾驶领域的应用提供了系统性指导。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的迭代验证框架，通过Judge LLM批评和Planner LLM修订来净化任务计划，提高空间一致性和动作质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的任务计划和人类演示存在噪声动作、冗余导航和逻辑错误，降低了策略质量

Method: 使用Judge LLM批评动作序列，Planner LLM应用修订，通过自然语言提示进行迭代验证

Result: 在TEACh数据集上达到90%召回率和100%精确度，96.5%序列最多3次迭代收敛，改善时空效率

Conclusion: 该方法为具身AI中的模仿学习提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据生成路径，支持鲁棒纠错行为研究

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该文章研究了跨域选择超级假方的策略变换方法，通过重点关注低级假方集合的组成和策略性变换，在使用简单随机选择机制的情况下也能超越现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的选择超级假方主要关注从预定义集合中适应性选择低级假方，而该研究重点关注于低级假方集合的组成和策略性变换。

Method: 系统分析了基于三个关键原则的变换：解决方案接受、低级假方重复和扰动强度。并在简单的假假方选择机制上演示了这些变换的效果。

Result: 通过适当的策略变换，简单的随机选择机制在三个具有挑战性的实际领域中超越了所有现有的最先进超级假方，发现了11个新的最佳解。同时在CHeSC竞赛标准测试中也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过策略性变换方法，不仅能够在跨域选择超级假方中超越当前最先进方法，还能简化设计。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合学习方法虽然能生成可理解和可验证的策略，但无法扩展到大规模问题，只能处理数百个状态和特征的小规模训练实例。

Method: 采用命中集算法对采样计划进行泛化来学习策略，确保结构终止和无环性，替代了传统的SAT/ASP方法。

Result: 方法能够有效处理包含数百万状态和数十万特征的大规模问题，在多个基准测试中展现出良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了符号化策略学习中的可扩展性问题，为大规模规划问题的策略学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Result: 实验证明该框架产生的自适应探索策略在多个MuJoCo环境中优于标准探索方法

Conclusion: 基于不确定性的自适应探索框架提供了一种原则性的方法来解决探索-利用切换问题，具有通用性和优越性能

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Result: 在30个生成任务评估中，综合验证实现73.3%可行率，开源模型在结构化环境中达到闭源模型80.8%的性能，已生成3000多个应用。

Conclusion: 扩展可靠的AI代理需要扩展环境而不仅仅是模型，为生产导向的代理系统提供了实证见解和完整参考实现。

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Motivation: 当前大多数研究集中于演绎推理，而归纳和潜推理在实际问题解决中同样重要但很少被探索，需要系统性评估LLM在这两种推理能力上的表现。

Method: 创建了可编程的合成数据集InAbHyD，每个推理示例包含不完整世界模型和观察结果，要求模型产生解释观察的假设，并采用基于奥卡姆前刀的新评量标准来评估假设质量。

Result: 研究发现当前最先进的LLM在简单场景中能够进行归纳和潜推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现局限，甚至在使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术时也无法产生高质量的假设。

Conclusion: 这项研究弥补了LLM在非演绎推理能力评估方面的空白，显示了当前模型在归纳和潜推理方面的局限性，为未来推理能力的提升提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自治AI代理存在的信息泄漏问题（83%泄漏率）和可靠性低的问题

Method: 提出一种底层框架，让AI代理基于环境变化触发行为，并使用专门的代理视角（aspects）来控制信息感知和流向

Result: 与传统架构相比，该框架实现了零信息泄漏，显著提升安全性

Conclusion: 专门化代理在自己的信息小生境中工作，可以同时提高安全性和效率

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

TL;DR: SAM-LLM是一种混合架构，将大语言模型的上下文推理能力与运动学换道模型的物理精度相结合，用于自动驾驶中的可解释换道轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法在自动驾驶轨迹预测中缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化方法实现物理上合理的连续轨迹预测。

Method: 微调LLM输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数而非原始坐标，对于换道操作使用增强的正弦加速度模型(SAM)参数，包括横向位移、操作时长、初始横向速度和纵向速度变化。

Result: 实现了98.73%的整体意图预测准确率，输出大小相比基于坐标的方法减少80%，在保持与传统LLM预测器相当性能的同时显著提升了可解释性和资源效率。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM通过参数化轨迹预测方法成功实现了物理可解释、计算高效的自动驾驶轨迹预测，为自动驾驶系统提供了更好的可解释性和资源利用效率。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过长期神经元失活和状态记忆恢复机制，提出Lifecycle原则，解决了神经元长时间失活后重新激活导致的训练不稳定问题，提升了模型的沿午性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比Dropout等短暂正则化方法，长期神经元失活会导致重新激活时随机初始化的严重训练不稳定问题，需要找到有效解决方案。

Method: 提出Lifecycle(LC)原则，核心是状态记忆机制。当神经元重新激活时，不是重新初始化，而是恢复到上次有效运行时的参数状态，保留学到的知识。

Result: 理论分析显示Lifecycle原则能够平滑损失函数地形，导向更平坦的最小值，对应更好的沿午性。图像分类实验证明方法能提升沿午性和稳健性，切除实验确认状态记忆是关键。

Conclusion: Lifecycle原则通过状态记忆机制，有效解决了长期神经元失活导致的训练不稳定问题，为神经网络正则化提供了新的思路和有效方法。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Conclusion: 将EM推理与MARL结合能显著改善复杂高风险保护场景中的分散决策能力

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical
challenge, particularly in vast and partially observable environments where
real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) coordination in wildlife protection. By modeling hidden
environmental factors and inter-agent dynamics through latent variables, our
method enhances exploration and coordination under uncertainty.We implement and
evaluate our EM-MARL framework using a custom simulation involving 10 UAVs
tasked with patrolling protected habitats of the endangered Iranian leopard.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate superior performance in detection
accuracy, adaptability, and policy convergence when compared to standard
algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic
Policy Gradient (DDPG). Our findings underscore the potential of combining EM
inference with MARL to improve decentralized decisionmaking in complex,
high-stakes conservation scenarios. The full implementation, simulation
environment, and training scripts are publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了组意识阈值检定方法，通过为不同人口统计组设置不同的决策阈值，在类别不平衡问题中较合成数据生成方法更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统类别不平衡处理方法常带来新问题的挑战，需要更简单、可解释性强的解决方案。

Method: 采用组意识阈值检定方法，为不同人口统计组设置不同的决策阈值，优化平衡准确率和最差组平衡准确率之间的底特雷边界。

Result: 该方法在7种模型家族中实现了1.5-4%更高的平衡准确率，同时提高了最差组平衡准确率，较SMOTE和CT-GAN方法更优。

Conclusion: 组意识阈值检定提供了一种更简单、可解释性强且更有效的类别不平衡解决方案，与合成数据生成方法存在重复性。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公共卫生领域中序列资源分配问题的奖励函数设计挑战，这些场景具有目标复杂模糊、数据有限的特点，需要能够处理偏好分布不确定性的鲁棒方法

Method: 基于直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，引入轻量级的分布鲁棒优化(DRO)公式来处理偏好分布的不确定性，相比之前的DRO-based DPO方法更加不保守

Result: 在真实世界的母婴移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，DPO-PRO相比现有DPO变体在噪声偏好信号下表现出更好的鲁棒性，同时与基于自反思的基线方法性能相当但推理成本显著降低

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能够在数据有限、目标复杂的公共卫生应用场景中设计出高质量的奖励函数，为实际部署提供了实用且高效的解决方案

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

Motivation: 研究策略网络中表征结构的形成机制，发现最优策略DNN会出现类似神经坍缩的动作坍缩现象，这启发了使用固定ETF结构来引导策略学习。

Method: 提出动作坍缩策略梯度方法(ACPG)，在动作选择层固定使用合成的等角紧框架结构，引导策略DNN产生理想的配置同时保持最优性。

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中的实验表明，ACPG可以集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中，能够更快、更鲁棒地获得更好的奖励改进。

Conclusion: 固定ETF结构作为动作选择层可以自然引导策略网络产生动作坍缩，ACPG方法有效提升了策略梯度学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG数据噪声大、高维、非线性，传统机器学习方法难以抓取其复杂的空间-时间动态特征，需要更好的模型来处理

Method: 训练Mamba基础模型在大规模症狀和非症狀EEG数据上，先进行自监督重构任务，然后进行症狀检测任务

Result: 在指定测试集上达到AUROC 0.72的性能水平

Conclusion: 该方法为开发大规模、临床应用的EEG基础模型奠定了重要基础

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

TL;DR: LExI是一种数据无关的MoE模型优化技术，通过自适应调整每层激活专家数量来提升推理效率，相比传统剪枝方法在保持精度的同时显著提高吞吐量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE剪枝方法主要减少内存占用但无法显著提升GPU推理性能，且固定激活专家数导致冗余计算和次优性能

Method: LExI利用模型权重估计每层相对重要性，自适应分配每层激活专家数量，无需训练数据

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上实现相同吞吐量且精度提升10%

Conclusion: LExI通过层间专家数量自适应分配，有效解决了MoE模型推理效率问题，在保持精度的同时大幅提升计算效率

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型、不同稀疏度和分辨率的地下观测数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一种能够处理多模态数据并支持灵活扩展的模型架构。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型生成），支持八种模态包括方向角度、分类类别和连续属性如温度和厚度。

Result: 在验证数据上，预测应力角的误差减少了三倍以上，模型性能随参数增加而提升。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth为地球地下属性预测提供了一个可扩展的基础模型框架，能够预测地球上任何地方的地下属性。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Motivation: 当前的物理知识符号回归方法需要专业的形式化和手动特征工程，限制了普通研究者的使用。希望通过LLM自动化域知识集成，使过程更加易用

Method: 将预训练LLM集成到SR的损失函数中，添加LLM对生成方程的评价条款。使用三种SR算法(DEAP, gplearn, PySR)和三种LLM(Falcon, Mistral, LLama 2)，在三种物理动力学问题上进行评测

Conclusion: 预训练LLM可以有效地自动化物理知识在符号回归中的集成，为更广泛的科学问题提供了更易用的解决方案

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Motivation: 现有预测不确定性方法存在局限：多假设预测缺乏原则性聚合，集成学习难以捕捉结构化模糊性，缺乏与损失几何一致的统一框架。

Method: 使用Bregman散度诱导的质心聚合连接多假设预测和集成学习，支持闭式最小二乘估计器和基于梯度的通用目标优化，提供可调多样性机制。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在多假设泛化和损失感知集成聚合方面的有效性，并在深度学习预测器上研究了复杂度-容量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络提供了一个统一的框架，能够同时处理回归和分类问题，通过控制偏差-方差-多样性权衡来改善预测不确定性估计。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Method: 进行自监督预训练，让GNN预测图拉普拉斯矩阵的低频特征向量，因为这些向量编码了全局结构信息

Result: 经验证明，通过该框架预训练的模型在多种图结构任务上表现超过基线模型

Conclusion: 该自监督预训练框架基于结构、灵活性强，可应用于所有图数据集，在任务特定数据稀缩时还可使用合成特征

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决的机制分离问题，通过线性探测和注意力模式分析发现LLaVA-OV-7B模型在中间层存在可线性解码的冲突信号，检测与解决机制在网络不同阶段分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中冲突检测与冲突解决机制难以分离的挑战，以提升模型在冲突性多模态输入下的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用线性探测方法进行监督度量，结合基于组的注意力模式分析，对LLaVA-OV-7B模型进行机制性研究。

Result: 发现模型中间层存在可线性解码的冲突信号，冲突检测和解决的注意力模式在网络不同阶段出现分化，支持两者是功能不同机制的假设。

Conclusion: 这种机制分解为实现更可操作的可解释性和针对性干预提供了可能，有助于提升模型在挑战性多模态环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

TL;DR: JensUn是一种新的大语言模型遗忘方法，使用Jensen-Shannon散度作为训练目标，在遗忘特定信息的同时保持模型性能，并通过改进的评估框架验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在全面评估下效果不佳，需要更稳定有效的遗忘机制来确保模型安全，删除预训练中获得的私有数据或有害知识。

Method: 提出JensUn方法，利用Jensen-Shannon散度作为遗忘集和保留集的训练目标，相比常用损失函数能实现更稳定有效的遗忘动态。同时引入LKF数据集和基于LLM的语义评估框架。

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中实现了比竞争方法更好的遗忘-效用权衡，表现出对良性重新学习的强韧性。改进的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如先前认为的好。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种有效的大语言模型遗忘解决方案，通过Jensen-Shannon散度目标和综合评估框架，显著提升了遗忘性能和安全保障能力。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖是一个全球急需关注的健康问题，机器学习在早期肥胖风险预测中显示出很大潜力，但对于集成技术（特别是混合多数投票咈集成堆叠方法）的比较评估仍有限。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、加权硬投票咈堆叠法（以多层感知机为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三名模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡咈离群检测，使用准确率咈F1分数评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 结果证明集成堆叠方法提供了更强的预测能力，尤其适用于复杂的数据分布，而混合多数投票仍然是一个健壮的备选方案。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TTC框架为更先进的PDE建模推理算法奠定了基础，包括构建基于强化学习的方法，可能改变物理和工程中的计算工作流程

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML
methodologies.

Conclusion: SBICE框架为因果评估提供了一种更可靠的方法，通过整合参数不确定性和后验推理，生成更符合真实数据特征的合成数据集，改善了因果估计器的比较基准。

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

Motivation: 自监督强化学习中，学习多样化技能集以应对未知任务是一个关键挑战。现有方法在可扩展性和评估方面存在问题：高维特征空间中相关特征难以识别，且多样性定义通常需要硬性承诺特定概念，导致结果难以比较和多样性形式受限。

Conclusion: VendiRL提供了一个统一的框架来解决自监督RL中的技能多样性问题，通过灵活的多样性定义和评估方法，为在各种环境中学习多样化技能集提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Result: 实验数据显示AR-KAN在72%的真实世界数据集上取得了优越的结果

Conclusion: AR-KAN混合模型有效解决了传统神经网络在处理非周期信号叠加问题时的局限性，结合了两种方法的优势

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

*Kaoru Otsuka,Yuki Takezawa,Makoto Yamada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了D-Byz-SGDM方法，通过延迟动量聚合机制解决联邦学习中部分参与场景下的拜占庭攻击问题，在理论收敛性和实验性能上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性限制下，部分参与场景中当采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时，现有方法会立即失效。

Method: 提出延迟动量聚合原则：服务器聚合非参与客户端最近接收的梯度与活跃客户端的即时动量。开发D-Byz-SGDM优化器实现该原则。

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了全参与结果并匹配部分参与设置的理论下界。深度学习实验验证了在各种拜占庭攻击下的稳定鲁棒训练。

Conclusion: 延迟动量聚合是解决部分参与联邦学习中拜占庭攻击问题的有效方法，D-Byz-SGDM在理论和实验上都证明了其优越性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

*Minxin Zhang,Yuxuan Liu,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaGO结合正交化动量更新和AdaGrad自适应步长，在保持正交更新方向的同时通过累积梯度范数自适应调整步长，在理论和实验上均优于Muon和Adam。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化动量更新在大型语言模型训练中表现出色，但缺乏自适应学习率机制；而AdaGrad虽然自适应但更新方向不具正交性。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出AdaGO算法，将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向结合，仅需增加一个标量变量（累积平方梯度范数）即可实现，计算和内存效率高。

Result: 在非凸函数的随机和确定性设置下建立了最优理论收敛率，在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上实验证明优于Muon和Adam。

Conclusion: AdaGO成功融合了正交化更新和自适应步长的优势，既保持了Muon的谱下降方向特性，又获得了AdaGrad的自适应能力，是一种高效且理论保证的优化算法。

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种流式、无源测试时自适应方法，结合熵最小化、批归一化统计刷新和安全机制，用于睡眠分期模型的在线自适应，在Sleep-EDF数据集上表现优于冻结基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠分期模型在面对未见过的生理学特征或记录条件时性能会下降，需要一种能够在部署时实时自适应的方法。

Method: 流式无源测试时自适应(TTA)方法，结合熵最小化(Tent)、批归一化统计刷新，以及两个安全机制：熵门控暂停不确定窗口的适应，EMA重置防止漂移。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF Expanded数据集上，使用单导联EEG数据，相比冻结基线获得一致性能提升，具有秒级延迟和最小内存占用，报告了各阶段指标和Cohen's k系数。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，无需源数据或患者校准，适用于设备端或床旁使用，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多模态数据融合方法，结合高成本X射线和低成本光电二极管吸收率数据，通过CNN-RNN框架预测激光粉末床熔融过程中的熔池动力学，实现仅用低成本数据即可准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监测方法存在局限性：X射线成像成本高不实用，光电二极管吸收率数据噪声大单独使用预测不准。需要找到既能保证精度又经济实用的监测方案。

Method: 多模态学习框架：CNN提取X射线空间特征，RNN提取吸收率时序特征，采用早期融合策略。然后用多模态模型作为迁移学习模型来微调仅使用吸收率数据的RNN模型。

Result: 多模态训练显著提高预测精度，训练后的模型仅需吸收率数据即可推断熔池特性，无需昂贵X射线成像。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了经济高效实时监测，在增材制造领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

*Zida Wu,Mathieu Lauriere,Matthieu Geist,Olivier Pietquin,Ankur Mehta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种高效的深度强化学习算法，用于在均值场游戏中寻找纳什均衡，无需依赖历史采样或平均，能够适应不同初始分布和共同噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 均值场游戏是研究大规模多智能体系统的强大框架，但在初始分布未知或存在共同噪声时，学习纳什均衡仍然具有挑战性。现有方法依赖平均或历史采样，限制了算法的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 基于Munchausen RL和在线镜像下降的深度强化学习算法，不依赖平均或历史采样，直接学习种群依赖的纳什均衡策略。

Result: 在七个经典示例上的数值实验表明，该算法相比最先进的算法（特别是基于虚拟游戏的DRL版本）具有更优越的收敛性能。在共同噪声存在的情况下表现出良好的鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该算法为均值场游戏中的纳什均衡学习提供了一种高效、适应性强的解决方案，特别在处理未知初始分布和共同噪声方面表现出色，为大规模多智能体系统的研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

### [47] [Binary Quantization For LLMs Through Dynamic Grouping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03054)
*Xinzhe Zheng,Zhen-Qun Yang,Haoran Xie,S. Joe Qin,Arlene Chen,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大语言模型二进制量化的新优化目标和三种算法，通过自适应分组策略动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵，在保持高模型质量的同时实现平均1.007比特的超低比特率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二进制量化能显著减少存储和推理成本，但传统方法会导致明显的性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法。

Method: 提出专门针对二进制量化的优化目标，设计三种算法实现该目标，通过自适应分组策略增强分块量化，动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵。

Result: 量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型困惑度达到8.23（原模型7.81），显著优于之前SOTA BiLLM的123.90，与4位量化方法GPTQ性能相当，压缩过程高效（单CPU核心14秒完成量化）。

Conclusion: 该方法在实现超低比特率（1.007比特）的同时保持了接近原始模型的性能，在性能和效率方面都具有竞争力，且具备高度并行特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

*Sahil Rajesh Dhayalkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过拓展ReLU过渡图(RTG)框架，建立了深度ReLU网络的图论模型，揭示了线性激活区域的离散几何结构特性对网络泛化能力的关键影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了通过离散几何的视角来理解深度ReLU网络的功能性能，探索网络结构特性与泛化性能之间的关联。

Method: 扩展ReLU过渡图(RTG)框架，将每个线性激活区域表示为节点，并通过边连接仅差一个ReLU激活翻转的区域。进行理论分析和实验验证。

Result: 证明了随机初始化时RTG具有强扩展性、二项度分布和谱特性，这些特性突出地控制着泛化性能。区域位置在过参数化时饱和，谱间隔与泛化性相关联，相邻区域间的KL散度反映功能平滑性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个统一的框架，通过离散功能几何的视角来分析ReLU网络，为理解、诊断和改善泛化性能提供了新的工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Conclusion: Loong项目提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，通过合成数据生成和代码执行验证，能够在多个推理密集型领域实现强化学习，推动LLMs推理能力的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

TL;DR: LSAM是一种新颖的优化器，在保持SAM泛化优势的同时提供更高的分布式大批次训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM通过最小化损失和锐度来改善深度神经网络的泛化能力，但在分布式大批次训练中存在效率低下的问题

Method: LSAM将SAM的对抗步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成异步分布式采样方案，产生平滑的锐度感知损失景观进行优化

Result: 该设计消除了同步瓶颈，加速了大批次收敛，相比数据并行SAM提供了更高的最终准确率

Conclusion: LSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时，显著提高了分布式训练的效率和性能

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DHCP的分层深度强化学习模型，用于交通信号控制，通过高层和低层智能体分别分配主干道方向和转向运动的绿灯时间，解决了传统"选择相位"和"切换"策略的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DRL交通信号控制方法存在两个问题："选择相位"策略可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响驾驶员安全预期，"切换"策略可能导致相位分配不公平和效率低下。需要一种既能保持可预测性又能灵活分配时间的方法。

Method: 提出Deep Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP)分层模型：高层智能体基于整体交通状态分配南北和东西方向的总周期时间，低层智能体进一步在每个主要方向内分配直行和左转运动的时间。

Result: 在真实和合成的道路网络及交通流数据集上测试，模型在所有数据集上都优于基线方法，取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层时间分配机制，在保持相位序列可预测性的同时实现了更灵活和公平的交通信号控制，有效提升了交通效率。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Motivation: 解决传统TDCR多核素分析中的自动化限制和依赖混合物标准的问题，特别是在标准源不易获得或需要快速现场分析的情况下

Method: 采用Geant4模拟生成β谱数据，结合统计检测器响应采样，构建了包含多种核素混合比和漒灭场景的训练数据集，设计了专门的神经网络结构进行端到端学习

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法具有强大的演绎能力、实时处理能力和工程可行性，特别适用于无标准物质或需要快速现场分析的场景

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

TL;DR: 本文首次实证量化了自动驾驶场景中动作预测任务的Rashomon效应，发现不同模型对同一预测提供显著不同的解释，说明解释歧义是问题固有属性而非建模伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，可解释AI(XAI)对于模型验证和信任至关重要，但Rashomon效应（多个同等准确模型对同一预测提供不同解释）挑战了XAI的可靠性。

Method: 使用定性可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类不同模型（可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的基于图的图神经网络），并通过特征归因方法测量模型内部和模型间的解释一致性。

Result: 结果显示显著的解释不一致性，不同模型对同一预测提供截然不同的解释。

Conclusion: 解释歧义是动作预测问题的固有属性，而不仅仅是建模方法的产物，这对安全关键应用中XAI的可靠性提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无阈值的归因方法评估框架，解决了传统单一阈值评估导致的偏差问题，在皮肤病学影像中证明了更可靠的方法分异能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值选择可能导致方法排名逆转和结论错误，影响评估的可靠性和决策。

Method: 提出一种无阈值框架，通过计算交并比下面积（AUC-IoU）来评估归因质量，考察全阈值范围内的表现。在7种归因方法上进行实验验证。

Result: 无阈值评估提供了可靠的方法差异化：XRAI比LIME提升30%，比集成梯度提升204%。大小分层分析显示不同病变规模性能差异达269%。

Conclusion: 该无阈值框架为归因方法评估建立了方法学标准，消除了评估偏差，为医学影像和其他领域提供了可靠的方法选择指南。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

Method: 提出了三种公平性决策树设计方案：1）使用y和s的综合目标函数；2）以y为目标函数并加入s的约束（包括贪心和回溯方法）；3）分别建立预测y和s的两棵树，使两者结构独立。本文重点研究了前两种未经充分研究的方法。

Conclusion: 本文扩展了公平性决策树的设计空间，对之前未经充分研究的两种方案进行了实验分析，为该领域提供了更多的设计选择和理解。

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Motivation: 现有评估指标(如F1和F1$_{pa}$)在实际应用中导致模型性能评估不准，特别是在地靠标签为单点事件但实际现象是渐进性的场景下

Method: 设计了窗口基于F1指标(F1$_w$)，包含时间容寍机制，在三个生理数据集(ADARP、Wrist Angel、ROAD)上进行实验分析

Result: F1$_w$能够显示传统指标无法发现的有意义模型性能模式，窗口大小可根据领域知识调整避免高估

Conclusion: 评估指标的选择强烈影响模型性能解释，F1$_w$为健康应用提供了更健壮的评估方法，适用于不同时间精度要求的场景

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Conclusion: FoMEMO框架为昂贵多目标优化问题提供了新的解决方案，通过大规模合成数据预训练的基础模型实现了无需后续训练的高效优化。

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易早期检测的框架，通过窗口-时间建模、峰谷采样和双曲嵌入技术，实现了从被动分类到主动预警的转变，在比特币交易数据上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账、拉盘砸盘）对金融完整性构成日益严重的风险，但由于类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖关系，检测异常交易非常困难。现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，只能在异常发生后标记，预防价值有限。

Method: HyPV-LEAD框架包含三个创新：1）窗口-时间建模确保可操作的提前预警时间；2）峰谷（PV）采样缓解类别不平衡同时保持时间连续性；3）双曲嵌入捕捉区块链交易网络的层次结构和无标度特性。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实证评估显示，HyPV-LEAD始终优于最先进的基线方法，实现了0.9624的PR-AUC，在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提升。消融研究证实每个组件都提供互补的益处。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从被动分类转变为主动预警，HyPV-LEAD为实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和动态区块链环境中的金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: TopoMap能够有效创建DL模型输入特征空间的拓扑图，系统性地识别不同故障特征区域，显著提升测试输入的筛选效率。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Motivation: 虽然GANs和扩散模型都可以在差分隐私下训练以保护敏感数据，但它们对成员推理攻击的敏感性仍然未被充分理解，这是数据机密性的关键威胁。

Method: 通过基于稳定性的理论分析比较两种模型对数据扰动的敏感性，并使用标准化的MIA流程进行全面的实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露情况。

Conclusion: 模型类型本身可以关键性地影响隐私泄露程度，GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面具有结构优势，这为选择隐私保护生成模型提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a

*Oguzhan Baser,Kaan Kale,Po-han Li,Sandeep Chinchali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-Synergy是一个开源的公平资源分配算法框架，通过利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系，在多智能体云辅助智能系统中实现公平的资源分配，在推理和学习任务中分别比基准方法提升25%和11%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资源分配方法忽视了智能体之间不同的计算能力和复杂操作环境的多样性，导致资源分配效率低下且不公平，需要一种能够确保多智能体智能系统公平资源分配的新方法。

Method: 开发了Fair-Synergy算法框架，扩展传统分配方法以涵盖由模型参数、训练数据量和任务复杂性定义的多维机器学习效用空间，利用智能体准确性与系统资源之间的凹关系来确保公平分配。

Result: 在BERT、VGG16、MobileNet、ResNets等先进视觉和语言模型以及MNIST、CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、BDD、GLUE等数据集上的评估显示，Fair-Synergy在多智能体推理中比标准基准提升25%，在多智能体学习中提升11%。

Conclusion: Fair-Synergy有效解决了多智能体云辅助智能系统中的公平资源分配问题，不仅提升了整体性能，还深入分析了公平性水平对不同优势程度智能体的影响，为公平的群体智能提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of
cloud-assisted multi-agent intelligence. Traditional methods often overlook
agents' diverse computational capabilities and complex operating environments,
leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing
insights for equitable fleet intelligence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PROF是一种通过过程一致性过滤来协调细粒度过程奖励和粗粒度结果奖励的数据处理方法，有效解决了RLVR中奖励模型的粒度不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中的结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度，无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励黑客问题。

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择来协调PRM和ORM的互补优势，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提高最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量。

Conclusion: PROF通过有效的数据处理策略成功解决了RLVR中奖励模型的粒度不匹配问题，在提高准确性的同时改善了推理过程质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

TL;DR: 提出Meta-Imputation Balanced (MIB)方法，通过学习组合多个基础插补器的输出来更准确地预测缺失值，解决机器学习中缺失数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺失数据是机器学习应用中的基本挑战，特别是在生物信息学和临床机器学习领域，数据集经常不完整。现有插补方法在不同数据集和缺失机制下表现不一致，需要更稳健的解决方案。

Method: 提出Meta-Imputation Balanced (MIB)方法，通过在已知真实值的合成掩码数据上训练，学习根据每种方法的行为预测最合适的插补值，采用集成学习方法。

Result: 该方法能够更准确地预测缺失值，提高了插补的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了集成学习在插补中的潜力，为现实世界机器学习系统中更稳健、模块化和可解释的预处理流程铺平了道路。

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD中量化会导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，QPQuant通过动态选择量化层和损失感知优先级来减少量化方差，在保持隐私保护的同时提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD中的噪声注入会放大量化方差，导致量化在隐私保护训练中造成不成比例的精度下降，需要解决这一挑战

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架，包含概率性层采样轮换和基于差分隐私损失敏感度估计的损失感知层优先级选择

Result: 在多个网络和数据集上验证，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，达到接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐提升达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持差分隐私保护的同时显著提升了训练效率和硬件性能

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

TL;DR: EvolveSignal使用大型语言模型自动发现新的交通信号控制算法，通过程序合成和进化搜索优化，在信号交叉口实验中比Webster基准减少20.1%的平均延迟和47.1%的平均停车次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定时间交通信号控制依赖手工公式和人工调整，劳动密集且在异构或拥堵条件下效果不佳，需要自动化算法设计方法。

Method: 将问题建模为程序合成，候选算法表示为具有固定输入输出结构的Python函数，通过外部评估（交通模拟器）和进化搜索进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验显示发现的算法优于Webster基准，平均延迟减少20.1%，平均停车次数减少47.1%，并提供对交通工程师有实际意义的见解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计，开辟了新的研究方向，将程序合成与交通工程相结合。

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中缺失模态和有限标注数据的关键挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 提出软正样本-无标签对比损失最大化任务相关特征对齐，以及潜在重构损失确保模态特异性信息保留，采用模块化设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证显示，Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态场景下均优于现有方法，性能表现优越。

Conclusion: 该框架轻量且可扩展，能够无缝集成到现有架构中，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

Motivation: 深度学习推动了蛋白质基础模型的发展，但缺乏系统性红队测试引发了对其潜在滥用的严重担忧，比如生成具有生物安全风险的蛋白质

Method: 结合多模态提示工程和启发式束搜索，设计了红队测试方法，并构建了包含手动构建的红队测试基准数据集和全面评估协议的SafeProtein-Bench

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

TL;DR: 本文提出AEnt方法解决LLM-RL训练中传统熵正则化效果不佳的问题，通过钳制熵奖励和自动调整系数来改进探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，主要由于LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏。

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳制熵奖励（在较小token空间上重新归一化策略计算）和自动调整的熵系数，鼓励在更紧凑响应集中探索。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AEnt在不同基础模型和数据集上均优于基线方法，在多个基准测试中表现一致更好。

Conclusion: AEnt通过改进熵控制机制，有效解决了LLM-RL训练中的探索问题，为大规模语言模型的强化学习提供了更有效的熵正则化方法。

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中边缘设备因内存和通信限制被排除训练的问题，减少系统偏见，让低资源设备能够参与训练以获取更多样化的数据。

Method: 基于MeZO零阶方法，设计ZOWarmUp算法，利用不同客户端能力和方差减少技术，仅需传输随机种子而非完整梯度，大幅降低上行通信成本。

Result: 实验表明ZOWarmUp在各种数据集和模型架构下表现稳健，能够有效利用被排除设备的数据，提升训练效果。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp为高比例低资源设备的联邦学习系统提供了可行的解决方案，能够访问更大规模和多样性的数据，从而改善训练结果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Conclusion: LimiX证明了单一模型处理多样化表格任务的可行性，为结构化数据基础模型的发展奠定了基础

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Method: 采用61个国家的睡眠数据，进行统计相关分析，按夏令时制实施情况分组，通过可视化比较睡眠模式

Result: 实施夏令时制的国家平均睡眠时长更长；低纬度区睡眠时长缩短，高纬度区睡眠时长延长

Conclusion: 夏令时制对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的显著调节，纬度是关键因素

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化聚类数据时容易扭曲全局几何结构，需要更透明的方法来同时保持局部和全局信息

Method: 采用三步法：先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个聚类，最后对齐所有聚类以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，但透明度更高

Conclusion: 模块化的聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明的降维可视化方案，能更好地平衡局部和全局信息的保持

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Conclusion: 图基方法在激素症治疗决策支持中具有潜力，但表征学习在医疗领域的复杂性需要进一步研究和优化。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了KAN网络的初始化策略，提出了理论驱动的LeCun和Glorot初始化方法以及经验性的幂律初始化方法，在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然在各领域表现出色，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性的初始化方案来提升性能。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方法（LeCun和Glorot风格）和一个可调指数的幂律初始化家族，通过大规模网格搜索、NTK分析和Feynman数据集评估。

Result: Glorot初始化在参数丰富的模型中表现最佳，幂律初始化在所有任务和不同架构规模下都取得了最强的整体性能。

Conclusion: 合适的初始化策略对KAN网络性能至关重要，提出的方法显著优于基线，为KAN网络的实用化提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

*Phuc Pham,Viet Thanh Duy Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LINKER是首个基于序列的模型，仅使用蛋白质序列和配体SMILES就能预测残基-功能基团相互作用类型，无需3D结构输入


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖3D结构输入或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性，需要开发仅基于序列的相互作用预测方法

Method: 使用结构监督的注意力机制训练，通过功能基团基序提取从3D蛋白-配体复合物获得交互标签，将配体结构抽象为功能基团

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能产生与真实生化注释高度一致的作用预测

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可实现大规模应用，特别适用于结构数据不可用的情况，为分子识别和理性药物设计提供了新工具

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于GNN的框架，用于学习液体在刚体相互作用和主动操控下的动力学，能够处理复杂表面几何形状的粒子-物体碰撞，并在未见过的物体和新操控任务上展现良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法主要局限于静态自由落体环境或简单操控设置，忽略了与动态运动刚体的复杂相互作用，需要开发能够处理液体与刚体复杂交互的模拟框架。

Method: 使用图神经网络(GNN)框架，将粒子表示为图节点，采用边界体积层次(BVH)算法处理粒子-物体碰撞，能够建模液体粒子与复杂表面几何形状的交互。

Result: 模型在动态设置中准确捕捉流体行为，可作为静态自由落体环境模拟器，在单对象倾倒任务训练后能够有效泛化到未见物体和新操控任务(如搅拌和舀取)。

Conclusion: 该GNN框架成功解决了液体与刚体复杂交互的模拟问题，学习到的动力学可通过基于梯度的优化方法解决控制和操控任务，为实际应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

TL;DR: 本文证明了Tuning without Forgetting (TwF)方法在非奇异控制下形成有限余维Banach子流形，并刻画了其切空间，为顺序训练提供了精确保持映射的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为之前提出的TwF方法提供严格的理论基础，证明其在顺序训练中能够精确保持先前学习样本的端点映射，而不仅限于一阶近似。

Method: 通过数学分析证明在非奇异控制条件下，TwF的参数子空间构成有限余维Banach子流形，并对其切空间进行特征刻画。

Result: 证明了TwF方法对应的参数子空间确实形成Banach子流形，其切空间特征表明该方法能够实现控制函数沿着子流形切空间的连续变形。

Conclusion: 该研究为TwF顺序训练方法提供了坚实的数学理论基础，表明其能够精确实现映射保持（不遗忘），超越了之前的一阶近似理解。

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了全球作物类型数据集CropGlobe，开发了轻量级CNN模型CropNet，通过时间数据增强技术提升跨区域作物分类的泛化能力，发现Sentinel-2的2D中值时间特征具有最强的地理不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球尺度的作物类型精确监测对粮食安全至关重要，但现有方法受限于地理区域间可靠地面样本的缺乏，导致跨区域泛化性能下降。

Method: 构建包含30万个像素样本的全球数据集CropGlobe；比较Sentinel-2时间多光谱特征和EMIT高光谱特征的迁移性；设计轻量CNN模型CropNet并结合时间数据增强（时间偏移、时间尺度和幅度变形）。

Result: Sentinel-2的2D中值时间特征在所有迁移场景中表现出最强的地理不变性；数据增强技术显著提升了模型鲁棒性，特别是在训练数据多样性有限时。

Conclusion: 研究发现了更具不变性的特征表示，增强了地理可迁移性，为在全球多样化区域实现可扩展、低成本的作物类型应用提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work
identifies more invariant feature representations that enhance geographic
transferability and suggests a promising path toward scalable, low-cost crop
type applications across globally diverse regions.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在实际应用中趋于自主，其可靠性成为关注燕点。虽然幻觉现象已得到广泛研究，但模型知情意诽说谎的行为仍然研究不涵。本文动机在于系统性地研究LLM的说谎行为，并区分它与幻觉的不同。

Method: 采用机制解释技术，包括logit lens分析、因果干预和对比激活导航等方法，识别和控制欺骗行为。研究实际诽谎场景，并引入行为导航向量来精细操纵诽谎倾向。

Result: 揭示了LLM欺骗行为的神经机制，并发现诽谎与终端任务性能存在权衡关系，在某些情况下不谭过可以提高目标优化效果。建立了一个帕累托前沿，显示了这种权衡。

Conclusion: 研究结果为AI伦理讨论做出了贡献，揭示了在高风险环境中部署LLM的风险和潜在防护措施。这项工作强调了对模型诽谎行为进行系统研究和开发相应安全措施的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

Motivation: 传统排序算法需要所有元素对之间的比较，但在实际应用中可能只有部分比较是允许的，需要研究在受限比较条件下的排序和偏序发现问题

Method: 将问题建模为图论问题，通过禁止比较对形成的图的团数和色数来参数化算法，扩展到非完全可排序图的部分序发现，并针对Erdős–Rényi图设计高效算法

Result: 开发了一个简单算法，在输入图为Erdős–Rényi图时，总能以O(n^{3/2} log n)次探测确定底层偏序

Conclusion: 该研究为受限比较条件下的排序和偏序发现问题提供了图论框架和高效算法，特别在随机图模型下取得了良好的时间复杂度

Abstract: In this work, we study the generalized sorting problem, where we are given a
set of $n$ elements to be sorted, but only a subset of all possible pairwise
element comparisons is allowed. We look at the problem from the perspective of
the graph formed by the ``forbidden'' pairs, and we parameterize algorithms
using the clique number and the chromatic number of this graph. We also extend
these results to the class of problems where the input graph is not necessarily
sortable, and one is only interested in discovering the partial order. We use
our results to develop a simple algorithm that always determines the underlying
partial order in $O(n^{3/2} \log n)$ probes, when the input graph is an
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graph.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的动态排名聚合算法LR-Aggregation，基于LR-tree数据结构和新的LR距离，结合Pick-A-Perm算法，在动态设置中实现接近线性的时间复杂度，具有理论保证和优秀实践性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排名聚合问题在现实应用中广泛存在，在动态环境中新排名不断到达，需要高效更新聚合排名。现有方法在动态设置中缺乏既快速又有理论保证的算法。

Method: 开发LR-Aggregation算法，基于LR-tree数据结构和LR距离（与Spearman's footrule距离等价的新度量）。分析Pick-A-Perm算法的理论效率，并将其与LR-aggregation结合。

Result: 实验证明LR-Aggregation在实践中产生接近最优解。Pick-A-Perm具有理论最坏情况近似保证为2。两种算法及其组合方法都可在O(n log n)时间内运行。

Conclusion: 这是动态设置中第一个快速、接近线性时间的排名聚合算法，既具有理论近似保证，又具有优秀的实际性能（远优于理论保证）。

Abstract: The rank aggregation problem, which has many real-world applications, refers
to the process of combining multiple input rankings into a single aggregated
ranking. In dynamic settings, where new rankings arrive over time, efficiently
updating the aggregated ranking is essential. This paper develops a fast,
theoretically and practically efficient dynamic rank aggregation algorithm.
First, we develop the LR-Aggregation algorithm, built on top of the LR-tree
data structure, which is itself modeled on the LR-distance, a novel and
equivalent take on the classical Spearman's footrule distance. We then analyze
the theoretical efficiency of the Pick-A-Perm algorithm, and show how it can be
combined with the LR-aggregation algorithm using another data structure that we
develop. We demonstrate through experimental evaluations that LR-Aggregation
produces close to optimal solutions in practice. We show that Pick-A-Perm has a
theoretical worst case approximation guarantee of 2. We also show that both the
LR-Aggregation and Pick-A-Perm algorithms, as well as the methodology for
combining them can be run in $O(n \log n)$ time. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first fast, near linear time rank aggregation algorithm in the
dynamic setting, having both a theoretical approximation guarantee, and
excellent practical performance (much better than the theoretical guarantee).

TL;DR: 针对大规模图上1-median问题的快速近似算法，通过提前终止Dijkstra算法来显著减少计算时间，在保持接近最优解的同时实现数量级的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确算法在大规模图上计算成本过高，而实际应用中客户节点数量少且空间集中，不需要进行全图搜索。

Method: 提出了三种基于提前终止Dijkstra算法的近似算法，通过理论分析保证近似比分别为2和1.618。

Result: 算法在保持接近最优精度的同时，运行时间显著优于基线精确方法，在1000万节点的网格图上仅需1毫秒，而精确方法需要70秒以上。

Conclusion: 所提算法为大规模图上的1-median问题提供了高效实用的解决方案，特别适用于客户节点数量少且集中的实际应用场景。

Abstract: The 1-median problem (1MP) on undirected weighted graphs seeks to find a
facility location minimizing the total weighted distance to all customer nodes.
Although the 1MP can be solved exactly by computing the single-source shortest
paths from each customer node, such approaches become computationally expensive
on large-scale graphs with millions of nodes. In many real-world applications,
such as recommendation systems based on large-scale knowledge graphs, the
number of nodes (i.e., potential facility locations) is enormous, whereas the
number of customer nodes is relatively small and spatially concentrated. In
such cases, exhaustive graph exploration is not only inefficient but also
unnecessary. Leveraging this observation, we propose three approximation
algorithms that reduce computation by terminating Dijkstra's algorithm early.
We provide theoretical analysis showing that one of the proposed algorithms
guarantees an approximation ratio of 2, whereas the other two improve this
ratio to 1.618. We demonstrate that the lower bound of the approximation ratio
is 1.2 by presenting a specific instance. Moreover, we show that all proposed
algorithms return optimal solutions when the number of customer nodes is less
than or equal to three. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
significantly outperform baseline exact methods in runtime while maintaining
near-optimal accuracy across all tested graph types. Notably, on grid graphs
with 10 million nodes, our algorithms obtains all optimal solutions within 1
millisecond, whereas the baseline exact method requires over 70 seconds on
average.

Motivation: 解决在稀疏图中高效检测三角形的问题，避免全局代数卷积方法导致的超线性计算或细粒度障碍

Method: 使用O(log n)层次处理，将边分配到基于前缀的类中，每个类维护一个1-稀疏三元组。通过对齐和验证流水线检测潜在三角形

Result: 算法在O(m log² n)时间和O(m log n)空间内完成，生成可验证的证据文档，且运行时间有高概率保证

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种高效的非代数三角形检测方法，为实现Las Vegas O(m log n)和确定性近线性变种排优了路径

Abstract: We present a non-algebraic, locality-preserving framework for triangle
detection in worst-case sparse graphs. Our algorithm processes the graph in
$O(\log n)$ independent layers and partitions incident edges into prefix-based
classes where each class maintains a 1-sparse triple over a prime field.
Potential witnesses are surfaced by pair-key (PK) alignment, and every
candidate is verified by a three-stage, zero-false-positive pipeline: a
class-level 1-sparse consistency check, two slot-level decodings, and a final
adjacency confirmation. \textbf{To obtain single-run high-probability coverage,
we further instantiate $R=c_G\log n$ independent PK groups per class (each
probing a constant number of complementary buckets), which amplifies the
per-layer hit rate from $\Theta(1/\log n)$ to $1-n^{-\Omega(1)}$ without
changing the accounting.} A one-shot pairing discipline and class-term
triggering yield a per-(layer,level) accounting bound of $O(m)$, while
keep-coin concentration ensures that each vertex retains only $O(d^+(x))$ keys
with high probability. Consequently, the total running time is $O(m\log^2 n)$
and the peak space is $O(m\log n)$, both with high probability. The algorithm
emits a succinct Seeds+Logs artifact that enables a third party to replay all
necessary checks and certify a NO-instance in $\tilde O(m\log n)$ time. We also
prove a $\Theta(1/\log n)$ hit-rate lower bound for any single PK family under
a constant-probe local model (via Yao)--motivating the use of $\Theta(\log n)$
independent groups--and discuss why global algebraic convolutions would break
near-linear accounting or run into fine-grained barriers. We outline measured
paths toward Las Vegas $O(m\log n)$ and deterministic near-linear variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的字典匹配算法在压缩字符串上效率低下，需要先解压缩再处理，涉及大量多余计算。这篇论文的动机是在保持压缩格式的前提下，直接在压缩字符串上进行高效的字典匹配操作。

Method: 提出了两种新技术：1）一种新的压缩表示方式来表示经典的Aho-Corasick自动机；2）一种新的高效字符串索引结构，支持在运行长度编码字符串上进行快速查询。

Result: 算法在期望时间复杂度为O((μ + ν)log log m + occ)，空间复杂度为O(μ)，其中μ和ν分别是模式和文本的运行数量，m是模式总长度，occ是匹配次数。这是该问题的第一个非平凡解决方案。

Conclusion: 该算法在压缩字符串上实现了高效的字典匹配，时间复杂度在读入输入的前提下差一个log log m因子就达到优化。新提出的压缩自动机表示和字符串索引技术为压缩字符串处理领域提供了重要的技术进展。

Abstract: Given a set of pattern strings $\mathcal{P}=\{P_1, P_2,\ldots P_k\}$ and a
text string $S$, the classic dictionary matching problem is to report all
occurrences of each pattern in $S$. We study the dictionary problem in the
compressed setting, where the pattern strings and the text string are
compressed using run-length encoding, and the goal is to solve the problem
without decompression and achieve efficient time and space in the size of the
compressed strings. Let $m$ and $n$ be the total length of the patterns
$\mathcal{P}$ and the length of the text string $S$, respectively, and let
$\overline{m}$ and $\overline{n}$ be the total number of runs in the run-length
encoding of the patterns in $\mathcal{P}$ and $S$, respectively. Our main
result is an algorithm that achieves $O( (\overline{m} + \overline{n})\log \log
m + \mathrm{occ})$ expected time, and $O(\overline{m})$ space, where
$\mathrm{occ}$ is the total number of occurrences of patterns in $S$. This is
the first non-trivial solution to the problem. Since any solution must read the
input, our time bound is optimal within an $\log \log m$ factor. We introduce
several new techniques to achieve our bounds, including a new compressed
representation of the classic Aho-Corasick automaton and a new efficient string
index that supports fast queries in run-length encoded strings.

Motivation: 单调链极化码虽然能实现分布式无损编码的完整可容许速率区域，但其灵活性给现有的SC解码方案带来了重大挑战，需要一种通用的解码解决方案。

Method: 将SC解码任务制定为一系列极化变换的推理子任务，基于概率传播原理提出计算图框架，分析变量切换对解码的影响，并引入常数时间解码器分叉策略。

Conclusion: 提出的计算图框架和常数时间分叉策略为单调链极化码提供了高效的通用SC解码解决方案，能够处理各种复杂场景并实现时间高效的列表解码。

Abstract: Monotone chain polar codes generalize classical polar codes to multivariate
settings, offering a flexible approach for achieving the entire admissible rate
region in the distributed lossless coding problem. However, this flexibility
also introduces significant challenges for existing successive cancellation
(SC) based decoding schemes. Motivated by the need for a general SC decoding
solution, we present a comprehensive decoding strategy for monotone chain polar
codes that can handle arbitrary numbers of terminals, non-binary alphabets, and
decoding along arbitrary monotone chains. Specifically, we formulate the SC
decoding task as a series of inference subtasks over the polar transform and
propose a computational graph framework based on probability propagation
principles. This approach highlights the impact of variable switching during
decoding and shows that time complexity varies between $O(N\log{N})$ and
$O(N^2)$, depending on the specific chain structure. Moreover, we demonstrate
that the widely used $O(N)$ space optimization is not universally applicable to
monotone chain polar codes, which prompts us to introduce a constant-time
decoder forking strategy based on the proposed logical computation graphs. This
strategy enables time-efficient list decoding without relying on $O(N)$-space
techniques. Numerical results verify the superior performance of the proposed
scheme compared with the classical lazy-copy scheme.

Result: 新边界对接近最小距离或码长的码字权重施加了更严格的限制，扩展了已知的排除权重范围，并在标准参数集上展示了数值优势。

Conclusion: 基于权重w的边界分析为线性码的结构限制提供了更精细的工具，特别是在MDS码权重约束、一般线性码数值限制和权重分布排除范围等方面有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Bounds on linear codes play a central role in coding theory, as they capture
the fundamental trade-off between error-correction capability (minimum
distance) and information rate (dimension relative to length). Classical
results characterize this trade-off solely in terms of the parameters $n$, $k$,
$d$ and $q$. In this work we derive new bounds under the additional assumption
that the code contains a nonzero codeword of weight $w$.By combining
residual-code techniques with classical results such as the Singleton and
Griesmer bounds,we obtain explicit inequalities linking $n$, $k$, $d$, $q$ and
$w$. These bounds impose sharper restrictions on admissible codeword weights,
particularly those close to the minimum distance or to the code length.
Applications include refined constraints on the weights of MDS codes, numerical
restrictions on general linear codes, and excluded weight ranges in the weight
distribution. Numerical comparisons across standard parameter sets demonstrate
that these $w$-aware bounds strictly enlarge known excluded weight ranges and
sharpen structural limitations on linear codes.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: PoolPy是一个统一的群体检测框架，提供10种不同方法的最优策略选择和设计，通过web界面计算超过10,000种设计方案，帮助用户根据时间、成本等约束条件选择最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模筛查活动中，群体检测相比单个样本检测可大幅减少检测次数，但由于方法多样且缺乏易用工具，选择和实施合适的群体检测方法仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 开发PoolPy统一框架，集成10种群体检测方法，根据用户定义的时间、成本或样本稀释等约束条件，计算和比较不同设计方案的最优策略。

Result: 通过计算10,000多种群体检测设计，识别了关键权衡因素（如最小化检测次数或组大小），发现没有单一方法在所有情况下都是最优的。

Conclusion: 群体检测方法的选择需要根据具体使用场景进行个案分析，PoolPy框架为用户提供了清晰的指导和方法选择依据。

Abstract: In large screening campaigns, group testing can greatly reduce the number of
tests needed when compared to testing each sample individually. However,
choosing and applying an appropriate group testing method remains challenging
due to the wide variety in design and performance across methods, and the lack
of accessible tools. Here, we present PoolPy, a unified framework for designing
and selecting optimal group testing strategies across ten different methods
according to user-defined constraints, such as time, cost or sample dilution.
By computing over 10,000 group testing designs made available through a web
interface, we identified key trade-offs, such as minimizing test number or
group size, that define applicability to specific use cases. Overall, we show
that no single method is universally optimal, and provide clear indications for
method choice on a case-by-case basis.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于梯度敏感度的方法来解决决策依赖博弈中的分布偏移问题，无需依赖不切实际的β平滑性假设，能够保证收敛到性能稳定均衡点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖β平滑性假设，要求损失函数梯度相对于数据分布具有Lipschitz连续性，但实际中数据分布映射关系通常未知，导致β无法获取，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出梯度敏感度度量来直接量化决策引起的分布偏移影响，基于强单调性假设开发敏感性感知的重复重训练算法，调整玩家的损失函数。

Result: 在预测误差最小化博弈、古诺竞争和收益最大化博弈的实验中，该方法优于现有基线方法，实现了更低的损失和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的敏感性度量方法能够有效处理任意数据分布映射下的决策依赖博弈问题，为性能稳定均衡点的求解提供了实用且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: In decision-dependent games, multiple players optimize their decisions under
a data distribution that shifts with their joint actions, creating complex
dynamics in applications like market pricing. A practical consequence of these
dynamics is the \textit{performatively stable equilibrium}, where each player's
strategy is a best response under the induced distribution. Prior work relies
on $\beta$-smoothness, assuming Lipschitz continuity of loss function gradients
with respect to the data distribution, which is impractical as the data
distribution maps, i.e., the relationship between joint decision and the
resulting distribution shifts, are typically unknown, rendering $\beta$
unobtainable. To overcome this limitation, we propose a gradient-based
sensitivity measure that directly quantifies the impact of decision-induced
distribution shifts. Leveraging this measure, we derive convergence guarantees
for performatively stable equilibria under a practically feasible assumption of
strong monotonicity. Accordingly, we develop a sensitivity-informed repeated
retraining algorithm that adjusts players' loss functions based on the
sensitivity measure, guaranteeing convergence to performatively stable
equilibria for arbitrary data distribution maps. Experiments on prediction
error minimization game, Cournot competition, and revenue maximization game
show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving lower
losses and faster convergence.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is central to computational advertising, achieving notable
commercial success by optimizing advertisers' bids within economic constraints.
Recently, large generative models show potential to revolutionize auto-bidding
by generating bids that could flexibly adapt to complex, competitive
environments. Among them, diffusers stand out for their ability to address
sparse-reward challenges by focusing on trajectory-level accumulated rewards,
as well as their explainable capability, i.e., planning a future trajectory of
states and executing bids accordingly. However, diffusers struggle with
generation uncertainty, particularly regarding dynamic legitimacy between
adjacent states, which can lead to poor bids and further cause significant loss
of ad impression opportunities when competing with other advertisers in a
highly competitive auction environment. To address it, we propose a Causal
auto-Bidding method based on a Diffusion completer-aligner framework, termed
CBD. Firstly, we augment the diffusion training process with an extra random
variable t, where the model observes t-length historical sequences with the
goal of completing the remaining sequence, thereby enhancing the generated
sequences' dynamic legitimacy. Then, we employ a trajectory-level return model
to refine the generated trajectories, aligning more closely with advertisers'
objectives. Experimental results across diverse settings demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves superior performance on large-scale auto-bidding
benchmarks, such as a 29.9% improvement in conversion value in the challenging
sparse-reward auction setting, but also delivers significant improvements on
the Kuaishou online advertising platform, including a 2.0% increase in target
cost.

TL;DR: 通过统一化标签数据和非标笇数据的相似度分数分布，并结合多个排序模型的排名融合技术，提高了RAG系统的检索效果和领域外演续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用标笇数据(输入-输出关联)和非标笇数据(更广泛的上下文基础)可以为检索增强生成(RAG)带来补充性优势，但有效结合来自这些异构来源的证据并非易事。

Method: 首先使用标准排名融合技术对每个来源(标笇和非标笇)的多个IR模型的顶部文档进行聚合，然后通过z-score变换标准化各来源内部的检索分数分布，最后合并两个来源的顶部检索到的文档。

Result: 在事实验证任务上评估，方法一贯地超过了最佳单个排序器或单个来源的性能，并显示出更好的领域外演续性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化异构来源的相似度分数和聚合多个排序器的信忽，可以有效提升RAG系统的检索效果和演续性。

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader
insights for e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes
and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of
complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

Abstract: In the contemporary age characterized by information abundance, rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence have rendered recommendation systems
indispensable. Conventional recommendation methodologies based on collaborative
filtering or individual attributes encounter deficiencies in capturing nuanced
user interests. Knowledge graphs and multimodal data integration offer enhanced
representations of users and items with greater richness and precision. This
paper reviews existing multimodal knowledge graph recommendation frameworks,
identifying shortcomings in modal interaction and higher-order dependency
modeling. We propose the Cross-Graph Cross-Modal Mutual Information-Driven
Unified Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation Framework
(CrossGMMI-DUKGLR), which employs pre-trained visual-text alignment models for
feature extraction, achieves fine-grained modality fusion through multi-head
cross-attention, and propagates higher-order adjacency information via graph
attention networks.

Motivation: 现有多媒体推荐系统通过评估相似性来推荐媒体内容，但缺乏对嵌入代表性和价值的系统考虑，导致嵌入的实用性和可解释性大幅下降。

Method: 提出基于概率的嵌入优化方法，使用基于负2-Wasserstein距离的对比损失来增强嵌入代表性；引入基于多变量Shapley值的重新加权策略来评估交互和嵌入的价值。

Result: 在多个骨干推荐器和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，RVRec能够显著提升现有推荐器的个性化和可解释性，优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: RVRec作为一种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，通过系统性考虑嵌入的代表性和价值，有效解决了现有推荐系统中嵌入质量不足的问题，为推荐系统的个性化和可解释性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing multimedia recommender systems provide users with suggestions of
media by evaluating the similarities, such as games and movies. To enhance the
semantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply
additional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,
without systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility
and explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a
plug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve
both personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we
propose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a
contrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance
the representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing
method based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore
the value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple
backbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the
personalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: RecBase通过推荐导向的预训练和跨域对齐技术，有效解决了LLM在推荐任务中的泛化问题，为跨域推荐提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real

Conclusion: OneSearch成功解决了传统电商搜索系统的局限性，在快手多个搜索场景中部署，服务数百万用户，每日产生数千万页面浏览量，证明了其工业实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading
architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational
efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented
computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which
ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose
\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative
framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key
innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)
module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes
while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view
user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user
IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences
to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward
System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive
reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's
superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online
A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure
position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR,
+2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces
operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from
3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple
search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of

Abstract: Increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) services imposes
substantial deployment and computation costs on providers. LLM routing offers a
cost-efficient solution by directing queries to the optimal LLM based on model
and query features. However, existing works primarily focus on offline
scenarios and struggle to adapt to online settings with high query volume and
constrained token budgets. In this work, we introduce the first training-free
algorithm for online routing scenarios. Our algorithm leverages approximate
nearest neighbor search to efficiently estimate query features and performs a
one-time optimization over a small set of initial queries to learn a routing
strategy that guides future routing. We provide theoretical guarantees
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of $1 - o(1)$
under natural assumptions, which is further validated by extensive experiments
across 3 benchmark datasets and 8 baselines, showing an average improvement of
3.55$\times$ in overall performance, 1.85$\times$ in cost efficiency, and
nearly 4.25$\times$ in throughput.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as a building block
in data systems to process large text datasets. To do so, LLM model providers
offer multiple LLMs with different sizes, spanning various cost-quality
trade-offs when processing text at scale. Top-of-the-line LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,
Claude Sonnet) operate with high accuracy but are prohibitively expensive when
processing many records. To avoid high costs, more affordable but lower quality
LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Claude Haiku) can be used to process records, but we
need to ensure that the overall accuracy does not deviate substantially from
that of the top-of-the-line LLMs. The model cascade framework provides a
blueprint to manage this trade-off, by using the confidence of LLMs in their
output (e.g., log-probabilities) to decide on which records to use the
affordable LLM. However, existing solutions following this framework provide
only marginal cost savings and weak theoretical guarantees because of poor
estimation of the quality of the affordable LLM's outputs. We present BARGAIN,
a method that judiciously uses affordable LLMs in data processing to
significantly reduce cost while providing strong theoretical guarantees on the
solution quality. BARGAIN employs a novel adaptive sampling strategy and
statistical estimation procedure that uses data and task characteristics and
builds on recent statistical tools to make accurate estimations with tight
theoretical guarantees. Variants of BARGAIN can support guarantees on accuracy,
precision, or recall of the output. Experimental results across 8 real-world
datasets show that BARGAIN reduces cost, on average, by up to 86% more than
state-of-the-art, while providing stronger theoretical guarantees on accuracy
of output, with similar gains when guaranteeing a desired level of precision or

Result: 在TPC-H基准测试中，CARPO的Top-1率达到74.54%（Lero仅为3.63%），总执行时间减少到3719.16ms（PostgreSQL为22577.87ms）。

Conclusion: CARPO通过列表学习排序方法和混合决策机制，显著提升了查询优化性能，证明了其在查询计划优化方面的有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Efficient data processing is increasingly vital, with query optimizers
playing a fundamental role in translating SQL queries into optimal execution
plans. Traditional cost-based optimizers, however, often generate suboptimal
plans due to flawed heuristics and inaccurate cost models, leading to the
emergence of Learned Query Optimizers (LQOs). To address challenges in existing
LQOs, such as the inconsistency and suboptimality inherent in pairwise ranking
methods, we introduce CARPO, a generic framework leveraging listwise
learning-to-rank for context-aware query plan optimization. CARPO distinctively
employs a Transformer-based model for holistic evaluation of candidate plan
sets and integrates a robust hybrid decision mechanism, featuring
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection with a top-$k$ fallback strategy to ensure
reliability. Furthermore, CARPO can be seamlessly integrated with existing plan
embedding techniques, demonstrating strong adaptability. Comprehensive
experiments on TPC-H and STATS benchmarks demonstrate that CARPO significantly
outperforms both native PostgreSQL and Lero, achieving a Top-1 Rate of
\textbf{74.54\%} on the TPC-H benchmark compared to Lero's 3.63\%, and reducing
the total execution time to 3719.16 ms compared to PostgreSQL's 22577.87 ms.

### [111] [Adaptive KV-Cache Compression without Manually Setting Budget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03136)
*Chenxia Tang,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GVote是一种自适应的KV缓存压缩方案，通过蒙特卡洛采样预测未来查询需求，无需手动指定压缩预算，在保持精度的同时实现2倍内存减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KV缓存压缩方法需要手动指定固定压缩比，无法适应多样化工作负载，导致资源分配和推理性能不佳

Method: 基于未来查询注意力需求预测原理，通过蒙特卡洛采样潜在查询并聚合选定键值，自动确定最优缓存预算

Result: 在GSM8K、RULER和Longbench等多个基准测试中，GVote在保持相当或更高精度的同时，实现了2倍内存减少

Conclusion: GVote通过自适应压缩方案有效解决了KV缓存内存占用问题，提供了更优的精度-效率权衡

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference relies heavily on KV-caches to
accelerate autoregressive decoding, but the resulting memory footprint grows
rapidly with sequence length, posing significant efficiency challenges. Current
KV-cache compression methods suffer from a Procrustes' bed problem: they force
diverse workloads into fixed compression ratios, leading to suboptimal resource
allocation and inference performance. To this end, we present GVote, an
adaptive KV-cache compression scheme that eliminates manual budget
specification while achieving superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. GVote
operates on the principle that the important keys are the aggregation of keys
required by future queries. The method predicts future query attention demands
by Monte-Carlo style sampling potential queries and aggregating selected keys
to determine the optimal cache budget without manual specification.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates GVote's effectiveness across multiple
benchmarks, including GSM8K, RULER and Longbench. Compared to baselines, GVote
exhibits 2$\times$ memory reduction while the accuracy maintains higher or
comparable.

Conclusion: BAMG通过联合考虑图结构和存储布局的相互作用，为磁盘基高维近伤搜索提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了系统性能

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors is a
foundational problem in databases, where disk I/O often emerges as the dominant
performance bottleneck at scale. Existing graph indexing solutions for
disk-based ANNS typically either optimize the storage layout for a given graph
or construct the graph independently of the storage layout, thus overlooking
their interaction. In this paper, we propose the Block-aware Monotonic Relative
Neighborhood Graph (BMRNG), a novel graph structure that jointly considers both
geometric distance and storage layout for edge selection, theoretically
guaranteeing the existence of I/O monotonic search paths. To address the
scalability challenge of BMRNG construction, we further develop a practical and
efficient variant, the Block-Aware Monotonic Graph (BAMG), which can be
constructed in linear time from a monotonic graph considering the storage
layout. BAMG integrates block-aware edge pruning with a decoupled storage
design that separates raw vectors from the graph index, thereby maximizing
block utilization and minimizing redundant disk reads. Additionally, we design
a multi-layer navigation graph for adaptive and efficient query entry, along
with a block-first search algorithm that prioritizes intra-block traversal to
fully exploit each disk I/O operation. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BAMG achieves up to 2.1x higher throughput and
reduces I/O reads by up to 52% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while
maintaining comparable recall.

Conclusion: NeurStore通过创新的张量级存储和压缩技术，有效解决了深度学习模型在数据库中的高效存储和管理问题。

Abstract: With the prevalence of in-database AI-powered analytics, there is an
increasing demand for database systems to efficiently manage the ever-expanding
number and size of deep learning models. However, existing database systems
typically store entire models as monolithic files or apply compression
techniques that overlook the structural characteristics of deep learning
models, resulting in suboptimal model storage overhead. This paper presents
NeurStore, a novel in-database model management system that enables efficient
storage and utilization of deep learning models. First, NeurStore employs a
tensor-based model storage engine to enable fine-grained model storage within
databases. In particular, we enhance the hierarchical navigable small world
(HNSW) graph to index tensors, and only store additional deltas for tensors
within a predefined similarity threshold to ensure tensor-level deduplication.
Second, we propose a delta quantization algorithm that effectively compresses
delta tensors, thus achieving a superior compression ratio with controllable
model accuracy loss. Finally, we devise a compression-aware model loading
mechanism, which improves model utilization performance by enabling direct
computation on compressed tensors. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
NeurStore achieves superior compression ratios and competitive model loading
throughput compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
