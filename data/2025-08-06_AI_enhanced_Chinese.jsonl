For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided\nexpander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative\nsize at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$\nfraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$\nwith the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This\nresult improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)\ndeveloping an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative\nsize at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient\n$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong\nregular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\\epsilon)$-factor\napproximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\\epsilon>0$.\n  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$\nmatrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove\nthat whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem\nis NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the\nother hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the\ncorresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.\n  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph\nspectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The\nnumber of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\\tau$ is at most $O(1/\\tau^{2})$\ntimes the number of eigenvalues larger than $\\tau^{2}/2$.

This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the\nproblem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \\cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$\nand $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks\n[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,\nhighlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give\ncombinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an\nalgorithm parametrized by $w (\\log w+1) /(k-1)$.

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge.

This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,\nthere are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes\ndynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old\nobjects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order\nlogic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,\ndiscuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely\nmany possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,\nand propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at\nplanning time.

Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM-trees) dominate as\ntheir underlying structure, excelling at handling rapidly growing data. Recent\nresearch has focused on optimizing LSM-tree performance under static workloads\nwith fixed read-write ratios. However, real-world workloads are highly dynamic,\nand existing workload-aware approaches often struggle to sustain optimal\nperformance or incur substantial transition overhead when workload patterns\nshift. To address this, we propose ElasticLSM, which removes traditional\nLSM-tree structural constraints to allow more flexible management actions\n(i.e., compactions and write stalls) creating greater opportunities for\ncontinuous performance optimization. We further design Arce, a lightweight\ncompaction decision engine that guides ElasticLSM in selecting the optimal\naction from its expanded action space. Building on these components, we\nimplement ArceKV, a full-fledged key-value store atop RocksDB.

In this\npaper, we address an unequal error protection (UEP) problem in digital semantic\ncommunication, where bits of higher semantic importance require stronger\nprotection. To quantify bit-level importance, we leverage bit-flip\nprobabilities of semantic bits as target error protection levels, which are\njointly learned with semantic encoder and decoder. We propose two novel channel\ncoding frameworks aimed at minimizing the total blocklength while satisfying\nUEP constraints.

The existing AI development landscape\nfalls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that\nnatively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that\nabstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While\npowerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,\nthey not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also\nsteerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and\nprecise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ\noptimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to\nself-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when\nself-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief\nor answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty\nlevels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph\nstructures, and interject corrections.

However, the success of these state-of-the-art\nmodels largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which\nlack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises\nquestions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.\nTo address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel\ninformation-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should\nbe a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based\non this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space\nModel (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by\noptimizing an objective function derived from our principle.

However, existing\ntoken-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their\nirreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns\nduring decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both\nmarginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the\ncollective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal\ninformation over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two\ncompensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices\nbetween LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted\ncompensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention\nmatching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in\nperceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller\nmodel's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger\nmodel. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and\nLongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV.

Despite recent\nadvances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures\nbased on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static\ndecomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion\nmechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To\nexplicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel\nDynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch\nDecomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale\nRouting MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in\ncomponent to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with\nexponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints\nthrough input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,\ninter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed\nrepresentations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a\nmulti-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained\nrepresentations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature\nextraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically\nfuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local\nexperts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen\nreal-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for\nTSF tasks.

It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)\nwith group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance\nsampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact\nestimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.\nHowever, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy\nbetween the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We\nvalidate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is\nentirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient\nestimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps.

We provide experimental evidence that perfect\nJacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training\nand achieve competitive performance.

(2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,\nthough the improvement slows down as models get bigger.

Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected\ndata substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal\nretrieval) for state-of-the-art models.

The results of this\nstudy suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and\nvalid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic\nstaff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be\nnecessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-4\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u586b\u8865\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u73af\u5883\u6559\u80b2\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u9700\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177EKT-19\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83AI\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u73af\u5883\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4e14\u6613\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ecd\u9700\u73af\u5883\u79d1\u5b66\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4fe1\u606f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional diagnostic methods,\ntypically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the\nmultifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from\nthree primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This\nframework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images\nand Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and\nbiomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by\naggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques\nlike weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not\nonly improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the\nidentification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage\nover conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is\nparticularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of\nclinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially\naltering the course of the disease.

In this setting, each\ndecision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial\nlogit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have\nsimultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,\nmotivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop\nalgorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy\nupdates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and\nRS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,\nrespectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update\nrounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can\nchoose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first\nalgorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the\nmultinomial setting and achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the\ncontexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\\Omega(\\log \\log T)$\nupdate rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated\ncontexts and can achieve $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\\tilde{O}(\\log T)$\npolicy updates.

This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating\ndecision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural\nrelationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously\neliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data\nflow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI\nsystematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual\ncode synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained\nmathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with\nLLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and\ndependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load\nassociated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy\nand efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUML2Dep\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408UML\u5e8f\u5217\u56fe\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55UML\u5e8f\u5217\u56fe\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u51b3\u7b56\u8868\u548cAPI\u89c4\u8303\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08DDI\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u663e\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548cDDI\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "UML2Dep\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548cLLM\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The steady growth of studies and\nfindings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to\nsystematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents\nan approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)\ngeneration to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of\nlarge language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts\ninto semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from\nthese sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain\nand ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate\nontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during\nextraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming\n`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing\nnatural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original\npropositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity\nfor generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated\nsentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context\nvariable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new\nrelationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge\ngraph.

In this framework, nodes represent individual\nbeliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),\nand two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source\ntrust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support).

These models\nare typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral\ndrift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.\nHowever, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due\nto its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose\nSmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior\ndata to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen\nconsists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware\nSplit module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically\ncoherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose\nSemantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving\nrepresentative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space.

Recent\nmachine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their\nreliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their\napplicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities\ndriven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a\npromising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual\ndata, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.\nTo address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM\nwith chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox\ncombines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)\nterms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step\nreasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional\nmachine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance\nacross various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we\nfind that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier\nfor LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and\nimproves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug\ndevelopment, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and\nincorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This\napproach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with\nphysiological responses, as shown in case study.

The gold score for a target class is supposed to\nbe 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes\nthe training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the\n\"target-approach-1\" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all\nsamples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already\nbeen classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply\nrequires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve\nthe above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which\ndesigns a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For\nmore purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores\ncompared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation.

This advancement is underpinned by the concept\nof Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training\ndata enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges.

This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience\ntargeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser\nheterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across\nadvertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity\ncreates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).\nTraditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical\nflaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific\nconstraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,\nand 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical\nrelationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we\npropose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding.

As a result, researchers have attempted to\nadapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing\nextra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the\nsuperior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their\nbase KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this\npaper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods\nand then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our\nresults show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of\nHKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods\nalter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.\nMoreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in\ncapturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate\nmain-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.\nTo further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE\nresearch, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a\nqualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based\ngraph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an\nimproved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to\nmitigate compression issues.

We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning\nframework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on\nuser-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA\ncompliance.

Reproducibility in machine learning\nevaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground\ntruth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,\namong whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has\nstudied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as\nis typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for\ncollecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more\nsamples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the\nper-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of\nitems ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable\nmachine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical\ndatasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated\ndistributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$\nconfiguration, given a fixed budget ($N \\times K$), for collecting evaluation\ndata and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our\nfindings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N\n\\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested\non at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \\times K$ almost always\noccurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and\n$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics\nthat are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better\nat higher levels of $K$.

In this paper, we propose a \\underline{s}treaming\n\\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\\underline{y} generated expert framework\nof \\underline{G}aussian \\underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both\ncomputational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,\nwhile inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian\nprocesses. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a\nspecific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or\nimproving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is\nvalidated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments\ndemonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSkyGP\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u6709\u9650\u4e13\u5bb6\u96c6\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSkyGP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff08SkyGP-Dense\u548cSkyGP-Fast\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SkyGP\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SkyGP\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language\nmodel can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying\nthe topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its\nown questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):\nan asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and\ngenerates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer\nand solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a\nreward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives\na reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of\nground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests\nwhich are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework\non three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the\nOMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration.
