This paper investigates a mixed\ncommunication model with multi-RIS-aided radio frequency (RF)-free space optics\n(FSO) to enhance the performance of IoT applications in complex environments.\nAn eavesdropper is assumed to be present, attempting to intercept confidential\ninformation transmitted over the RF link. All RF links are modeled using Rician\nfading, while the FSO link accounts for M\\'alaga turbulence with pointing\nerrors, capturing real-world propagation conditions. Closed-form analytical\nexpressions are derived for the secrecy outage probability, average secrecy\ncapacity, and effective secrecy throughput in terms of Meijer's G function.

We show that the control system itself can serve as an\nimplicit communication channel, enabling the controller to transmit messages\nthrough its inputs to a receiver that observes the system state. This\ncommunication is considered implicit because (i) no explicit communication\nchannels are needed; and (ii) information is transmitted while simultaneously\nfulfilling the controller's primary objective--maintaining the control cost\nwithin a specified level. As a result, there exists an inherent trade-off\nbetween control and communication performance. This trade-off is formalized\nthrough the notion of implicit channel capacity, which characterizes the\nsupremum reliable communication rate subject to a constraint on control\nperformance. We characterize the implicit channel capacity in three settings.\nWhen both the controller and the receiver have noiseless observations of the\nsystem state, the channel capacity admits a closed-form expression. When only\nthe controller has noiseless observations, the channel capacity is given by the\nsolution of a convex optimization. When both the controller and the receiver\nhave noisy observations, we establish a lower bound on the implicit capacity.\nSurprisingly, when the controller has noiseless observations, the\ncapacity-achieving input policy adheres to a separation principle, allowing the\ncontrol and channel coding tasks to be addressed independently, without loss of\noptimality.

Given a metric space $(P,\\mathsf{dist})$, where $P$ is a set of\nelements and $\\mathsf{dist}$ a distance metric, a family of sets\n$\\mathcal{H}\\subseteq 2^P$, and parameters $k, z$, the goal is to compute a set\nof $k$ centers $S\\subseteq P$ and a family of $z$ sets $H\\subseteq \\mathcal{H}$\nto minimize $\\max_{p\\in P\\setminus(\\bigcup_{h\\in H} h)} \\min_{s\\in\nS}\\mathsf{dist}(p,s)$.

We propose that assessing\nanti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme\non far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming\nis driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to\npre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of \"covert actions\" --\nsuch as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as\na proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then\nstress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26\nOOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert\naction rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them.

By tracking the evolution of this\ncomponent-graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on a\ncanonical induction task, I analyze a suite of graph-theoretic metrics. The\nresults reveal that the network's structure evolves through distinct phases of\nexploration, consolidation, and refinement. Specifically, I identify the\nemergence of a stable hierarchy of information spreader components and a\ndynamic set of information gatherer components, whose roles reconfigure at key\nlearning junctures.

Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective.

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified\nprinciple address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and\nfoster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.
