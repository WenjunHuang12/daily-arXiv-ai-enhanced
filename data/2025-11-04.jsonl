One key task in data\nintegration is the calculation of similarities between records in different\ndatabases to identify pairs or sets of records that correspond to the same\nreal-world entities. Due to privacy and confidentiality concerns, however, the\nowners of sensitive databases are often not allowed or willing to exchange or\nshare their data with other organisations to allow such similarity\ncalculations. Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) is the process of\nmatching records that refer to the same entity across sensitive databases held\nby different organisations while ensuring no information about the entities is\nrevealed to the participating parties. In this paper, we study how embedding\nbased encoding techniques can be applied in the PPRL context to ensure the\nprivacy of the entities that are being linked. We first convert individual\nq-grams into the embedded space and then convert the embedding of a set of\nq-grams of a given record into a binary representation. The final binary\nrepresentations can be used to link records into matches and non-matches. We\nempirically evaluate our proposed encoding technique against different\nreal-world datasets. The results suggest that our proposed encoding approach\ncan provide better linkage accuracy and protect the privacy of individuals\nagainst attack compared to state-of-the-art techniques for short record values."}

Existing methods for detecting Simpson's\nparadox overlook a key issue: many paradoxes are redundant, arising from\nequivalent selections of data subsets, identical partitioning of\nsub-populations, and correlated outcome variables, which obscure essential\npatterns and inflate computational cost. In this paper, we present the first\nframework for discovering non-redundant Simpson's paradoxes. We formalize three\ntypes of redundancy - sibling child, separator, and statistic equivalence - and\nshow that redundancy forms an equivalence relation. Leveraging this insight, we\npropose a concise representation framework for systematically organizing\nredundant paradoxes and design efficient algorithms that integrate depth-first\nmaterialization of the base table with redundancy-aware paradox discovery.\nExperiments on real-world datasets and synthetic benchmarks show that redundant\nparadoxes are widespread, on some real datasets constituting over 40% of all\nparadoxes, while our algorithms scale to millions of records, reduce run time\nby up to 60%, and discover paradoxes that are structurally robust under data\nperturbation.

However, current marine equipment is deficient in data transmission\nefficiency and semantic comprehension. To address these issues, this paper\nproposes a novel End-to-End (E2E) coding scheme, namely the Turbo-based Deep\nSemantic Autoencoder (Turbo-DSA). The Turbo-DSA achieves joint source-channel\ncoding at the semantic level through the E2E design of transmitter and\nreceiver, while learning to adapt to environment changes. The semantic encoder\nand decoder are composed of transformer technology, which efficiently converts\nmessages into semantic vectors. These vectors are dynamically adjusted during\nneural network training according to channel characteristics and background\nknowledge base. The Turbo structure further enhances the semantic vectors.\nSpecifically, the channel encoder utilizes Turbo structure to separate semantic\nvectors, ensuring precise transmission of meaning, while the channel decoder\nemploys Turbo iterative decoding to optimize the representation of semantic\nvectors. This deep integration of the transformer and Turbo structure is\nensured by the design of the objective function, semantic extraction, and the\nentire training process.

Such flows have played a role in\nprevious routing algorithms, including Schrijver's Homotopy Method and\nunsplittable flows in directed planar single-source instances. Recently\nuncrossed flows have played a key role in approximation algorithms for maximum\ndisjoint paths in fully-planar instances, where the combined supply plus demand\ngraph is planar. In the fully-planar case, any fractional multiflow can be\nconverted into one that is uncrossed, which is then exploited to find a good\nrounding of the fractional solution. We investigate finding an uncrossed\nmultiflow as a standalone algorithmic problem in general planar instances (not\nnecessarily fully-planar). We consider both a congestion model where the given\ndemands must all be routed, and a maximization model where the goal is to pack\nas much flow in the supply graph as possible (not necessarily equitably).\n  For the congestion model, we show that determining if an instance has an\nuncrossed (fractional) multiflow is NP-hard, but the problem of finding an\nintegral uncrossed flow is polytime solvable if the demands span a bounded\nnumber of faces. For the maximization model, we present a strong (almost\npolynomial) inapproximability result. Regarding integrality gaps, for\nmaximization we show that an uncrossed multiflow in a planar instance can\nalways be rounded to an integral multiflow with a constant fraction of the\noriginal value. This holds in both the edge-capacitated and node-capacitated\nsettings, and generalizes earlier bounds for fully-planar instances. In the\ncongestion model, given an uncrossed fractional multiflow, we give a rounding\nprocedure that produces an integral multiflow with edge congestion 2, which can\nbe made unsplittable with an additional additive error of the maximum demand."}

In this paper, we propose Simple Collaborative\nAugmentation for Recommendation (SCAR), a novel and intuitive augmentation\nmethod designed to maximize the effectiveness of CL for GCF. Instead of\nremoving information, SCAR leverages collaborative signals extracted from\nuser-item interactions to generate pseudo-interactions, which are then either\nadded to or used to replace existing interactions. This results in more robust\nrepresentations while avoiding the pitfalls of overly complex augmentation\nmodules.

The machine operates in the\ngeneral case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable\nreal numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\\epsilon$ are rational. The proof\nbuilds on Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem and relies on an exhaustive search\napproach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length\nuntil a valid code is found.
