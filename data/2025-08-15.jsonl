However, manual or semi-manual entry of\nstructured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow\nturnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate\ndescriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing\nretrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss\nfine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.\n  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for\ngenerating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a\nfine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key\nchallenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality\ngaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data\nrefinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures\nalignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual\nUnderstanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained\ninformation from visual inputs.\n  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference\noptimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving\nrobustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on\nreal-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms\nbaseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These\nresults demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and\ntextual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item\ndescriptions. This work advances automated listing optimization and supports\nscalable, high-quality content generation in e-commerce platforms."}

To\nbridge this gap, we propose ProxyRL-FRS, a proxy model-guided reinforcement\nlearning framework tailored for client selection in federated recommendation.\nSpecifically, we first introduce ProxyNCF, a dual-branch model deployed on each\nclient, which augments standard Neural Collaborative Filtering with an\nadditional proxy model branch that provides lightweight contribution\nestimation, thus eliminating the need for expensive per-round local training\ntraditionally required to evaluate a client's contribution.

In this paper we address\nthis challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion\nmodels, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.\nWe begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive\ninfilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a\nvalid word in the target language.

Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is\ncritically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data\ndistributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A\nparticularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the\nglobal model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying\nrare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a\nminority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,\nhindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this\nchallenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the\nproblem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a\nhierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local\ngenerator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide\ntailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a\ndedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual\ninformation-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.\nBy calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism\ncorrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of\nmutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,\nminority-class features.

This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally\nrich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties\ntrust that the provided attributions are indeed \"good,\" especially when they\nare used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this\npaper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification\nparadigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover\nlearns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a\nresource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides\nformal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of\nProbably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover\nand Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that\nare {\\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean\nSquared Error) with probability 1-{\\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover\narbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this\nis detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with\nprobability {\\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's\nworkload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must\nperform, scales only as O(1/{\\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset\nsize.
