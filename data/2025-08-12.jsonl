While resolution of points-of-interest (POIs) has been widely\naddressed, resolution of entities with diverse geometries has been largely\noverlooked. This is partly due to the lack of a uniform technique for embedding\nheterogeneous geometries seamlessly into a neural network framework. Existing\nneural approaches simplify complex geometries to a single point, resulting in\nsignificant loss of spatial information. To address this limitation, we propose\nOmni, a geospatial ER model featuring an omni-geometry encoder. This encoder is\ncapable of embedding point, line, polyline, polygon, and multi-polygon\ngeometries, enabling the model to capture the complex geospatial intricacies of\nthe places being compared. Furthermore, Omni leverages transformer-based\npre-trained language models over individual textual attributes of place records\nin an Attribute Affinity mechanism. The model is rigorously tested on existing\npoint-only datasets and a new diverse-geometry geospatial ER dataset. Omni\nproduces up to 12% (F1) improvement over existing methods.\n  Furthermore, we test the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct\ngeospatial ER, experimenting with prompting strategies and learning scenarios,\ncomparing the results of pre-trained language model-based methods with LLMs.\nResults indicate that LLMs show competitive results."}

These arcs and their episodic\ndevelopments are stored in a vector database, facilitating structured analysis\nand semantic comparison. To bridge automation with critical interpretation, a\ngraphical interface enables human oversight and refinement of the system's\nnarrative memory.

In the second phase, a self-training Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) refines the predictions using both labeled and high-confidence\npseudo-labeled samples, enabling robust semi-supervised learning. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated on the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset, a comprehensive\nreal-world supply chain dataset with fraud indicators. It achieves an F1-score\nof 0.817 while maintaining a false positive rate below 3.0%. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of combining unsupervised\npre-filtering with semi-supervised refinement for supply chain fraud detection\nunder real-world constraints, though we acknowledge limitations regarding\nconcept drift and the need for comparison with deep learning approaches."}

However, existing research has predominantly\nfocused on the commitment that neglects the freedom of players to abstain from\nan interaction, limiting their applicability to many real-world scenarios where\nparticipation is often voluntary. In this paper, we present a two-stage game\nmodel to investigate the evolution of commitment-based behaviours and\ncooperation within the framework of the optional Prisoner's Dilemma game. In\nthe pre-game stage, players decide whether to accept a mutual commitment. Once\nin the game, they choose among cooperation, defection, or exiting, depending on\nthe formation of a pre-game commitment. We find that optional participation\nboosts commitment acceptance but fails to foster cooperation, leading instead\nto widespread exit behaviour. To address this, we then introduce and compare\ntwo institutional incentive approaches: i) a strict one (STRICT-COM) that\nrewards only committed players who cooperate in the game, and ii) a flexible\none (FLEXIBLE-COM) that rewards any committed players who do not defect in the\ngame. The results reveal that, while the strict approach is demonstrably better\nfor promoting cooperation as the flexible rule creates a loophole for an\nopportunistic exit after committing, the flexible rule offers an efficient\nalternative for enhancing social welfare when such opportunistic behaviour\nresults in a high gain.

In this paper, we analyze\npractical constructions of quasi-cyclic GLDPC (QC-GLDPC) codes and show how to\nconstruct polynomial generator matrices in various forms using minors of the\npolynomial matrix. The approach can be applied to fully generalized matrices or\npartially generalized (with mixed constraint node types) to find better\nperformance/rate trade-offs. The resulting encoding matrices are presented in\nuseful forms that facilitate efficient implementation. The rich substructure\ndisplayed also provides us with new methods of determining low weight\ncodewords, providing lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance and often\ngiving those of weight equal to the minimum distance. Based on the minors of\nthe polynomial parity-check matrix, we also give a formula for the rank of any\nparity-check matrix representing a QC-LDPC or QC-GLDPC code, and hence, the\ndimension of the code. Finally, we show that by applying double graph-liftings,\nthe code parameters can be improved without affecting the ability to obtain a\npolynomial generator matrix."}

In this work, we introduce a new\nperspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into\nconstructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two\ndistributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be\nmutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers.\nThen, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial\nphase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local\ndenoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an\ninformation-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on\nconditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a\nreal-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures\nof diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small\nlocal neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are\nonly necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This\nresult also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions,\nthe broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the\ndesign of neural networks inspired by physics concepts."}

Using a\ntask-independent user representation that is effective across all such tasks\ncan reduce the need for task-specific feature engineering and model retraining,\nleading to more scalable and efficient machine learning pipelines. The goal of\nthe RecSys Challenge 2025 by Synerise was to develop such Universal Behavioral\nProfiles from logs of past user behavior, which included various types of\nevents such as product purchases, page views, and search queries. We propose a\nmethod that transforms the entire user interaction history into a single\nchronological sequence and trains a GRU-based autoencoder to reconstruct this\nsequence from a fixed-size vector. If the model can accurately reconstruct the\nsequence, the latent vector is expected to capture the key behavioral patterns.\nIn addition to this core model, we explored several alternative methods for\ngenerating user embeddings and combined them by concatenating their output\nvectors into a unified representation. This ensemble strategy further improved\ngeneralization across diverse downstream tasks and helped our team,\nai_lab_recsys, achieve second place in the RecSys Challenge 2025."}

At each\ntime slot, a controller decides whether to sample the environment and if so\nwhether to transmit a raw or processed sample, to the controller. Processing\nimproves transmission reliability over an unreliable wireless channel, but\nincurs an additional cost. The objective is to minimize the long-term average\nage of information (AoI), subject to constraints on the costs incurred at the\nsource and the cost of actuation error (CAE), a semantic metric that assigns\ndifferent penalties to different actuation errors. Although reducing AoI can\npotentially help reduce CAE, optimizing AoI alone is insufficient, as it\noverlooks the evolution of the underlying process. For instance, faster source\ndynamics lead to higher CAE for the same average AoI, and different AoI\ntrajectories can result in markedly different CAE under identical average AoI.\nTo address this, we propose a stationary randomized policy that achieves an\naverage AoI within a bounded multiplicative factor of the optimal among all\nfeasible policies.

These results offer\ninsights into the feasibility of the optimization problem, the structure of\nnear-optimal actions, and the fundamental trade-offs between AoI, CAE, and the\ncosts involved."}

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state\nupdates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial\nand intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms\nbaseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different\ncommunication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and\ncapacity limitations."}

This work investigates how transformers learn to\nsolve symbolic multi-step reasoning problems through chain-of-thought\nprocesses, focusing on path-finding in trees. We analyze two intertwined tasks:\na backward reasoning task, where the model outputs a path from a goal node to\nthe root, and a more complex forward reasoning task, where the model implements\ntwo-stage reasoning by first identifying the goal-to-root path and then\nreversing it to produce the root-to-goal path. Our theoretical analysis,\ngrounded in the dynamics of gradient descent, shows that trained one-layer\ntransformers can provably solve both tasks with generalization guarantees to\nunseen trees. In particular, our multi-phase training dynamics for forward\nreasoning elucidate how different attention heads learn to specialize and\ncoordinate autonomously to solve the two subtasks in a single autoregressive\npath.

Within this framework, a server extracts and transmits the\nsemantic information, i.e., the meaning of image data, to a user over several\ntime slots. An attacker seeks to detect and eavesdrop the semantic transmission\nto acquire details of the original image. To avoid data meaning being\neavesdropped by an attacker, a friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming\nsignals to interfere the attacker so as to hide the transmitted semantic\ninformation. Meanwhile, the server will strategically select time slots for\nsemantic information transmission. Due to limited energy, the jammer will not\ncommunicate with the server and hence the server does not know the transmit\npower of the jammer. Therefore, the server must jointly optimize the semantic\ninformation transmitted at each time slot and the corresponding transmit power\nto maximize the privacy and the semantic information transmission quality of\nthe user. To solve this problem, we propose a prioritised sampling assisted\ntwin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to jointly determine\nthe transmitted semantic information and the transmit power per time slot\nwithout the communications between the server and the jammer.

Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large.

In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL.

These characteristics make its core vector\nembeddings, i.e, the numerical representations of the music, highly susceptible\nto being learned, misused, or even stolen by models without accessing the\noriginal audio files. Traditional methods like copyright licensing and digital\nwatermarking offer limited protection for these abstract mathematical\nrepresentations, thus necessitating a stronger, e.g., cryptographic, approach\nto safeguarding the embeddings themselves. Standard encryption schemes, such as\nAES, render data unintelligible for computation, making such searches\nimpossible. While Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a plausible\nsolution by allowing arbitrary computations on ciphertexts, its substantial\nperformance overhead remains impractical for large-scale vector similarity\nsearches.

Given the equivalence\nbetween induction heads and conditional k-grams, a recent line of work modeling\nsequential inputs as Markov processes has revealed the fundamental impact of\nmodel depth on its ICL capabilities: while a two-layer transformer can\nefficiently represent a conditional 1-gram model, its single-layer counterpart\ncannot solve the task unless it is exponentially large. However, for higher\norder Markov sources, the best known constructions require at least three\nlayers (each with a single attention head) - leaving open the question: can a\ntwo-layer single-head transformer represent any kth-order Markov process? In\nthis paper, we precisely address this and theoretically show that a two-layer\ntransformer with one head per layer can indeed represent any conditional\nk-gram. Thus, our result provides the tightest known characterization of the\ninterplay between transformer depth and Markov order for ICL. Building on this,\nwe further analyze the learning dynamics of our two-layer construction,\nfocusing on a simplified variant for first-order Markov chains, illustrating\nhow effective in-context representations emerge during training. Together,\nthese results deepen our current understanding of transformer-based ICL and\nillustrate how even shallow architectures can surprisingly exhibit strong ICL\ncapabilities on structured sequence modeling tasks."}

The RL paradigm requires the agent to\ninstantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its\nactions on the environment.

In recent years, numerous frameworks have been\nproposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer\nspecific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these\nlimits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote\nReinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents\nexchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two\nunits: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the\nenvironment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs\nactions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the\nexchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for\nquicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art\nsolutions.

This\nlimitation hinders the adaptability of LLMs to practical scenarios, making\nmulti-objective alignment (MOA) a critical yet underexplored area. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose Pareto Multi-Objective Alignment (PAMA), a principled and\ncomputationally efficient algorithm designed explicitly for MOA in LLMs. In\ncontrast to computationally prohibitive multi-objective optimization (MOO)\nmethods, PAMA transforms multi-objective RLHF into a convex optimization with a\nclosed-form solution, significantly enhancing scalability. Traditional MOO\napproaches suffer from prohibitive O(n^2*d) complexity, where d represents the\nnumber of model parameters, typically in the billions for LLMs, rendering\ndirect optimization infeasible. PAMA reduces this complexity to O(n) where n is\nthe number of objectives, enabling optimization to be completed within\nmilliseconds. We provide theoretical guarantees that PAMA converges to a Pareto\nstationary point, where no objective can be improved without degrading at least\none other. Extensive experiments across language models ranging from 125M to 7B\nparameters demonstrate PAMA's robust and effective MOA capabilities, aligning\nwith its theoretical advantages. PAMA provides a highly efficient solution to\nthe MOA problem that was previously considered intractable, offering a\npractical and theoretically grounded approach to aligning LLMs with diverse\nhuman values, paving the way for versatile and adaptable real-world AI\ndeployments."}

From the perspective of mathematical operator theory, TSE can be\nviewed as a type of operator that maps available measurements of inerested\ntraffic state into unmeasured traffic state variables in real time. For the\nfirst time this paper proposes to study real-time freeway TSE in the idea of\nphysics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet), which is an\noperator-oriented architecture embedding traffic flow models based on deep\nneural networks. The paper has developed an extended architecture from the\noriginal PI-DeepONet. The extended architecture is featured with: (1) the\nacceptance of 2-D data input so as to support CNN-based computations; (2) the\nintroduction of a nonlinear expansion layer, an attention mechanism, and a MIMO\nmechanism; (3) dedicated neural network design for adaptive identification of\ntraffic flow model parameters. A traffic state estimator built on the basis of\nthis extended PI-DeepONet architecture was evaluated with respect to a short\nfreeway stretch of NGSIM and a large-scale urban expressway in China, along\nwith other four baseline TSE methods. The evaluation results demonstrated that\nthis novel TSE method outperformed the baseline methods with high-precision\nestimation results of flow and mean speed."}

NWP systems predict future atmospheric states at fixed locations,\nwhich are called NWP grid points, by analyzing previous atmospheric states and\nnewly acquired Earth observations without fixed locations. Thus, surrounding\nmeteorological context and the changing locations of the observations make\nspatial correlations between atmospheric states and observations over time. To\nhandle complicated spatial correlations, which change dynamically, we employ\nspatiotemporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) with structure learning. However,\nstructure learning has an inherent limitation that this can cause structural\ninformation loss and over-smoothing problem by generating excessive edges. To\nsolve this problem, we regulate edge sampling by adaptively determining node\ndegrees and considering the spatial distances between NWP grid points and\nobservations.

Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)\nfine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a\nmodel of cognition but also as a participant simulator for \"in silico\nprototyping of experimental studies\", e.g., to advance automated cognitive\nscience. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and\nassess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong\npredictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a\nparticipant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests\nthat, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it\ndoes not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an\naccurate model of cognition."}

We\npropose a procedure to check when the two kinds of policies (for a given\nenvironment, pdRM, and constant $k$) achieve the same optimal expected reward.\nWe then provide theoretical results establishing the expressive power of pdRMs,\nand space complexity results about the proposed learning problems. Finally, we\nprovide experimental results showing how agents can be trained to perform tasks\nrepresentable in deterministic context-free languages using pdRMs."}

Prior work like PlanGPT, a state-of-the-art\ndecoder-only transformer, struggles with extrapolation from easy to hard\nplanning problems. This in turn stems from problem symmetries: planning tasks\ncan be represented with arbitrary variable names that carry no meaning beyond\nbeing identifiers. This causes a combinatorial explosion of equivalent\nrepresentations that pure transformers cannot efficiently learn from. We\npropose a novel contrastive learning objective to make transformers\nsymmetry-aware and thereby compensate for their lack of inductive bias.\nCombining this with architectural improvements, we show that transformers can\nbe efficiently trained for either plan-generation or heuristic-prediction. Our\nresults across multiple planning domains demonstrate that our symmetry-aware\ntraining effectively and efficiently addresses the limitations of PlanGPT."}

Author's version. The final published\n  version will be available at the ACM Digital Library", "summary": "In modern recommender systems, experimental settings typically include\nfiltering out cold users and items based on a minimum interaction threshold.\nHowever, these thresholds are often chosen arbitrarily and vary widely across\nstudies, leading to inconsistencies that can significantly affect the\ncomparability and reliability of evaluation results. In this paper, we\nsystematically explore the cold-start boundary by examining the criteria used\nto determine whether a user or an item should be considered cold. Our\nexperiments incrementally vary the number of interactions for different items\nduring training, and gradually update the length of user interaction histories\nduring inference. We investigate the thresholds across several widely used\ndatasets, commonly represented in recent papers from top-tier conferences, and\non multiple established recommender baselines. Our findings show that\ninconsistent selection of cold-start thresholds can either result in the\nunnecessary removal of valuable data or lead to the misclassification of cold\ninstances as warm, introducing more noise into the system."}

We introduce FEAT (ForEnsic\nAgenT), a multi-agent AI framework that automates and standardizes death\ninvestigations through a domain-adapted large language model. FEAT's\napplication-oriented architecture integrates: (i) a central Planner for task\ndecomposition, (ii) specialized Local Solvers for evidence analysis, (iii) a\nMemory & Reflection module for iterative refinement, and (iv) a Global Solver\nfor conclusion synthesis. The system employs tool-augmented reasoning,\nhierarchical retrieval-augmented generation, forensic-tuned LLMs, and\nhuman-in-the-loop feedback to ensure legal and medical validity. In evaluations\nacross diverse Chinese case cohorts, FEAT outperformed state-of-the-art AI\nsystems in both long-form autopsy analyses and concise cause-of-death\nconclusions. It demonstrated robust generalization across six geographic\nregions and achieved high expert concordance in blinded validations. Senior\npathologists validated FEAT's outputs as comparable to those of human experts,\nwith improved detection of subtle evidentiary nuances. To our knowledge, FEAT\nis the first LLM-based AI agent system dedicated to forensic medicine, offering\nscalable, consistent death certification while maintaining expert-level rigor.\nBy integrating AI efficiency with human oversight, this work could advance\nequitable access to reliable medicolegal services while addressing critical\ncapacity constraints in forensic systems."}

However,\ncurrent joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with\nthe existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the\nsources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is\nsuboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we\npropose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over\nparallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic\nsource coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed\nand adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and\nchannel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as\nfunctions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic\nregression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E\ndistortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power\nallocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex\napproximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC\nscheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and\nparallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical\ndigital systems."}
