Our work focuses on the settings of dynamic graphs and dynamic\nparameterized queries, where the underlying graphs evolve over time (updated by\nedge insertions or deletions) and the input query parameters are specified on\nthe fly to fit application needs. Our first contribution is an interesting\nobservation that the SOTA solution, AGP-Static, can be adapted to support\ndynamic parameterized queries; however several challenges remain unresolved.\nFirstly, the query time complexity of AGP-Static is based on an assumption of\nusing an optimal algorithm for subset sampling in its query algorithm.\nUnfortunately, back to that time, such an algorithm did not exist; without such\nan optimal algorithm, an extra $O(\\log^2 n)$ factor is required in the query\ncomplexity, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graphs. Secondly,\nAGP-Static performs poorly on dynamic graphs, taking $O(n\\log n)$ time to\nprocess each update. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm,\nAGP-Static++, which is simpler yet reduces roughly a factor of $O(\\log^2 n)$ in\nthe query complexity while preserving the approximation guarantees of\nAGP-Static. However, AGP-Static++ still requires $O(n)$ time to process each\nupdate. To better support dynamic graphs, we further propose AGP-Dynamic, which\nachieves $O(1)$ amortized time per update, significantly improving the\naforementioned $O(n)$ per-update bound, while still preserving the query\ncomplexity and approximation guarantees. Last, our comprehensive experiments\nvalidate the theoretical improvements: compared to the baselines, our algorithm\nachieves speedups of up to $177\\times$ on update time and $10\\times$ on query\nefficiency."}

However, training\ntransformer-based SR models often encounters a high computational cost\nassociated with scoring extensive item catalogs, often exceeding thousands of\nitems. This occurs mainly due to the use of cross-entropy loss, where peak\nmemory scales proportionally to catalog size, batch size, and sequence length.\nRecognizing this, practitioners in the field of recommendation systems\ntypically address memory consumption by integrating the cross-entropy (CE) loss\nwith negative sampling, thereby reducing the explicit memory demands of the\nfinal layer. However, a small number of negative samples would degrade model\nperformance, and as we demonstrate in our work, increasing the number of\nnegative samples and the batch size further improves the model's performance,\nbut rapidly starts to exceed industrial GPUs' size (~40Gb).\n  In this work, we introduce the CCE- method, which offers a GPU-efficient\nimplementation of the CE loss with negative sampling. Our method accelerates\ntraining by up to two times while reducing memory consumption by more than 10\ntimes. Leveraging the memory savings afforded by using CCE- for model training,\nit becomes feasible to enhance its accuracy on datasets with a large item\ncatalog compared to those trained with original PyTorch-implemented loss\nfunctions.

Consequently, starting from discrete SAC\n(DSAC), we revisit the design of actor-critic methods in this setting.

There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes.

Recent efforts have mitigated this issue by\nquantizing model updates to reduce communication costs. However, most existing\nmethods apply quantization only after local training, introducing quantization\nerrors into the trained parameters and potentially degrading model accuracy. In\nthis paper, we propose Federated Bit Freezing (FedBiF), a novel FL framework\nthat directly learns quantized model parameters during local training.

Although effective, these online RL\nmethods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may\nnot capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization\nleads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce\nConservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL\nalgorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical\ndata, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining\nthe ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a\nquantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return\ndistribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs\noutright.

Communication becomes a major\nbottleneck in such settings but methods like Local Stochastic Gradient Descent\n(Local SGD) show great promise in reducing this additional communication\noverhead. Local SGD consists of three parts: a local optimization process, an\naggregation mechanism, and an outer optimizer that uses the aggregated updates\nfrom the nodes to produce a new model. While there exists an extensive\nliterature on understanding the impact of hyperparameters in the local\noptimization process, the choice of outer optimizer and its hyperparameters is\nless clear. We study the role of the outer optimizer in Local SGD, and prove\nnew convergence guarantees for the algorithm.
