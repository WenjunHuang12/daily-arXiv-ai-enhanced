This paper addresses the challenge of defining noise,\nwhich is inherently related to variability in human preferences and behaviors.\nIn classifying changes in user tendencies, we distinguish three kinds of\nphenomena: external factors that directly influence users' sentiment,\nserendipity causing unexpected preference, and incidental interaction perceived\nas noise. To overcome these problems, we present a new framework that\nidentifies noisy ratings. In this context, the proposed framework is modular,\nconsisting of three layers: known natural noise algorithms for item\nclassification, an Ensemble learning model for refined evaluation of the items\nand signature-based noise identification. We further advocate the metrics that\nquantitatively assess serendipity and group validation, offering higher\nrobustness in recommendation accuracy.

We\nanalyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two\napproaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in\npairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies\nrelevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how\ncontent providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to\naffect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to\nprefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers\ncan exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by\nattacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed\nattacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple\nranking schemes.

This study\npresents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a\nknowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich\nresponses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering\nproject-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A\ncentral innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation\n(RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework\nspecifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in\nparallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved\ndocument, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across\nmultiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage,\ncoherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to\nusers as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of\npossible misaligned or incomplete answers.

Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned\nAtlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit\nclassifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements\nof 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.\nBeyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and\neight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to\nguarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While\nAtlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with\nonly 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim\nto position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite\nfuture work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment."}

Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,\nDataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to\ndiverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a\nparadigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are\ncapable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,\ntransformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and\nretrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and\nunstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why\nthe convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a\ncritical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their\narchitectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and\ncapabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance\naction workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,\nsafeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy\nDataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions."}

As such, new\nrule-based algorithms such as FOLD-SE have been developed that provide tangible\njustification for predictions in the form of interpretable rule sets. The\nprimary objective of this study was to compare FOLD-SE and FOLD-R++, both\nrule-based classifiers, in binary classification and evaluate how FOLD-SE\nperforms against XGBoost, a widely used ensemble classifier, when applied to\nmulti-category classification. We hypothesized that because FOLD-SE can\ngenerate a condensed rule set in a more explainable manner, it would lose\nupwards of an average of 3 percent in accuracy and F1 score when compared with\nXGBoost and FOLD-R++ in multiclass and binary classification, respectively. The\nresearch used data collections for classification, with accuracy, F1 scores,\nand processing time as the primary performance measures. Outcomes show that\nFOLD-SE is superior to FOLD-R++ in terms of binary classification by offering\nfewer rules but losing a minor percentage of accuracy and efficiency in\nprocessing time; in tasks that involve multi-category classifications, FOLD-SE\nis more precise and far more efficient compared to XGBoost, in addition to\ngenerating a comprehensible rule set.

The agent's performance increases as the information in the context\nincreases, with the agent's parameters fixed. This phenomenon is typically\ncalled in-context RL (ICRL). The pretrained parameters of the agent network\nenable the remarkable ICRL phenomenon. However, many ICRL works perform the\npretraining with standard RL algorithms.

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed.

To meet the\ncommunity's growing RL needs, numerous RL frameworks have been proposed.

However, as privacy concerns escalate, it becomes\nincreasingly critical for publicly released models to safeguard sensitive\ninformation in training data. Typically, released models do not prioritize\nprivacy by design. In particular, tracing attacks from adversaries can combine\nthe released BN with auxiliary data to determine whether specific individuals\nbelong to the data from which the BN was learned. State-of-the-art protection\ntecniques involve introducing noise into the learned parameters. While this\noffers robust protection against tracing attacks, it significantly impacts the\nmodel's utility, in terms of both the significance and accuracy of the\nresulting inferences. Hence, high privacy may be attained at the cost of\nreleasing a possibly ineffective model. This paper introduces credal networks\n(CN) as a novel solution for balancing the model's privacy and utility. After\nadapting the notion of tracing attacks, we demonstrate that a CN enables the\nmasking of the learned BN, thereby reducing the probability of successful\nattacks. As CNs are obfuscated but not noisy versions of BNs, they can achieve\nmeaningful inferences while safeguarding privacy.

To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a\nmulti-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow\nfrom a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical\ngaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:\nFoam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,\nincluding advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of\nhandling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic\ngeneration of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via\nParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,\nthe framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as\ndiscrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other\nagentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.\nHigh-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a\nHierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a\ndependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.\nEvaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%\nsuccess rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing\nframeworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the\nexpertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems\ncan democratize complex scientific computing.

Existing models\nfor predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive\naccuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are\nfurther challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise\nonly a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these\nlimitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting\nActions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict\nridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler\npersonas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model\non demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce\nan individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to\ntheory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final\nclassifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their\ninteraction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode\nchoice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing\nchoice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.\nThis study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode\nchoices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various\napplications."}

In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic\nrepresentation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic\ngeometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and\nindispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals\nthe curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which\nquantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational\ntransitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the\nsemantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations.\nLike biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance,\nfound in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural\ndrift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not\njust tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.\n  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics:\nmeaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is\nthe physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how\nmeaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free\nneural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we\ncross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning,\nalignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between\ncheckpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and,\nultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models,\ndiagnose risks, and govern change over time."}

The\nsystem builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic\nmodels (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with\ncross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,\nfundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives\nusing momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion\nblock that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer\ndecoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease\nontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels\nin layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention\nmechanism.

Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest\nscreenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but\nthey suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on\nlong-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We\nintroduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,\nComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process\n(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task\nID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates\nmeta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and\nuses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device\ninference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,\nComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on\nhard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on\nsimple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and\nhalving inference time.

Yet it remains\nunclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more\nadvanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\\\"odel Test: evaluating whether\na model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved\nconjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures\nin combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source\npapers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then\nassessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5\nproduced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different\napproximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while\nproviding a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required\ncombining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a\nvalidated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but\nfailed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.\nAlthough our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on\nroutine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations\nwhen cross-paper synthesis is required.

In the incomplete data setting, an adversary may\ninspect the dataset and delete entries in up to an $\\eta$-fraction of samples\nper coordinate; a strong form of the Missing Not At Random model. In the\ncorrupted data setting, the adversary instead replaces values arbitrarily, and\nthe corruption locations are unknown to the learner. Despite substantial work\non missing data, linear regression under such adversarial missingness remains\npoorly understood, even information-theoretically. Unlike the clean setting,\nwhere estimation error vanishes with more samples, here the optimal error\nremains a positive function of the problem parameters. Our main contribution is\nto characterize this error up to constant factors across essentially the entire\nparameter range. Specifically, we establish novel information-theoretic lower\nbounds on the achievable error that match the error of (computationally\nefficient) algorithms.
