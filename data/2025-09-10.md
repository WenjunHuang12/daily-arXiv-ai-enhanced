### [2] [Private Queries with Sigma-Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07018)
*Jun Gao,Jie Ding*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出sigma-counting方法，使用σ-代数构建隐私保护计数查询，在保持隐私水平的同时显著提高输出准确性，支持大规模查询和时变数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过为每个查询添加独立噪声来保护隐私，但限制了查询数量和输出准确性，且无法保持嵌套查询的总序关系

Method: 基于σ-代数概念构建隐私保护计数查询框架，通过结构化噪声添加机制来保持查询间的数学关系

Result: 该方法能显著提高输出准确性，在保持相同隐私水平的前提下支持大规模查询，并维持嵌套查询的总序特性

Conclusion: sigma-counting方法有效解决了传统隐私保护计数查询的局限性，为大规模数据应用提供了更好的隐私保护解决方案

Abstract: Many data applications involve counting queries, where a client specifies a
feasible range of variables and a database returns the corresponding item
counts. A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks
leaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance
data privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically
achieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total
privacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of
queries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not
maintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many
applications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,
sigma-counting, that addresses these challenges. Sigma-counting uses the notion
of sigma-algebra to construct privacy-preserving counting queries. We show that
the proposed concepts and methods can significantly improve output accuracy
while maintaining a desired privacy level in the presence of massive queries to
the same data. We also discuss how the technique can be applied to address
large and time-varying datasets.

### [3] [JOINT: Join Optimization and Inference via Network Traversal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07230)
*Szu-Yun Ko,Ethan Chen,Bo-Cian Chang,Alan Shu-Luen Chang*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出模糊连接框架，自动识别可连接列对并发现跨多数据库的间接连接路径，解决传统关系数据库需要手动指定连接键和精确匹配的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关系数据库要求用户手动指定连接键并假设列名和值的精确匹配，这限制了在命名不一致或分散的表之间的连接性

Method: 结合列名相似性和行级模糊值重叠，使用负对数转换的Jaccard分数计算边权重，通过图遍历执行连接路径发现

Result: 在合成医疗风格数据库上的实验表明，系统能够在列名模糊化和部分值不匹配的情况下恢复有效连接

Conclusion: 该研究在数据集成方面具有直接应用价值，为处理不一致命名的分散数据表提供了有效的连接解决方案

Abstract: Traditional relational databases require users to manually specify join keys
and assume exact matches between column names and values. In practice, this
limits joinability across fragmented or inconsistently named tables. We propose
a fuzzy join framework that automatically identifies joinable column pairs and
traverses indirect (multi-hop) join paths across multiple databases. Our method
combines column name similarity with row-level fuzzy value overlap, computes
edge weights using negative log-transformed Jaccard scores, and performs join
path discovery via graph traversal. Experiments on synthetic healthcare-style
databases demonstrate the system's ability to recover valid joins despite
fuzzified column names and partial value mismatches. This research has direct
applications in data integration.

### [4] [Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search: A Unified Benchmark and Systematic Experimental Study [Experiment, Analysis & Benchmark]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07789)
*Jiayang Shi,Yuzheng Cai,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文对过滤近似最近邻搜索（FANNS）算法进行了系统性调查和基准测试，提出了分类法、评估框架和标准化基准，以解决现有研究中参数耦合、缺乏系统分析和不可靠比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FANNS算法缺乏系统性研究，存在参数耦合、数据集依赖性强、关键影响因素分析不足以及实验设计偏差等问题，导致难以理解各算法的相对优劣和适用场景。

Method: 提出三种方法分类（过滤后搜索、搜索后过滤、混合搜索），建立系统性评估框架，统一参数调优和标准化过滤，进行全面的实证研究分析查询难度和数据集特性对性能的影响。

Result: 建立了标准化的FANNS基准测试，提供了统一的评估框架和开源资源，能够更公平地比较不同算法性能，并明确了各方法在不同场景下的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 通过系统性分类、标准化评估框架和全面实证分析，为FANNS研究提供了可靠的基准和资源，促进了该领域可重复性研究和算法性能的公平比较。

Abstract: For a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$ and structured label $f$, the goal of
Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) algorithms is to find
top-$k$ points closest to a query that satisfy label constraints, while
ensuring both recall and QPS (Queries Per Second). In recent years, many FANNS
algorithms have been proposed. However, the lack of a systematic investigation
makes it difficult to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses.
Additionally, we found that: (1) FANNS algorithms have coupled,
dataset-dependent parameters, leading to biased comparisons. (2) Key impact
factors are rarely analyzed systematically, leaving unclear when each algorithm
performs well. (3) Disparate datasets, workloads, and biased experiment designs
make cross-algorithm comparisons unreliable. Thus, a comprehensive survey and
benchmark for FANNS is crucial to achieve the following goals: designing a fair
evaluation and clarifying the classification of algorithms, conducting in-depth
analysis of their performance, and establishing a unified benchmark. First, we
propose a taxonomy (dividing methods into \textit{filter-then-search},
\textit{search-then-filter}, \textit{hybrid-search}) and a systematic
evaluation framework, integrating unified parameter tuning and standardized
filtering across algorithms to reduce implementation-induced performance
variations and reflect core trade-offs. Then, we conduct a comprehensive
empirical study to analyze how query difficulty and dataset properties impact
performance, evaluating robustness under pressures like filter selectivity,
Recall@k, and scalability to clarify each method's strengths. Finally, we
establish a standardized benchmark with real-world datasets and open-source
related resources to ensure reproducible future research.

### [5] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型，结合区间值Fermatean模糊集来处理多准则决策中的不确定性和模糊性，并将其应用于可再生能源选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多准则决策方法在不确定、复杂和冲突情况下帮助决策者做出更好决策。模糊集理论能有效处理人类思维和感知中的不确定性，特别是Fermatean模糊环境作为模糊集的推广，能更好地处理决策判断中的模糊性。选择可再生能源是因为满足能源需求、平衡碳排放和缓解全球气候变化影响是当前最关键的问题之一。

Method: 提出基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型来确定部分已知特征权重，并将该方法与区间值Fermatean模糊集相结合。

Result: 该方法成功应用于可再生能源选择问题，能够有效处理决策过程中的不确定性和模糊判断。

Conclusion: 结合Fermatean模糊集和偏差最大化方法的优化模型为多准则决策提供了有效的工具，特别适用于可再生能源选择这类具有技术、管理和政治多重影响的复杂决策问题。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

### [6] [From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全频谱的神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为频谱模板，在频谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和频谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合符号推理的可解释性和神经网络的可扩展性，通过频谱方法在知识图谱上进行高效推理，解决传统方法在准确性、推理速度和鲁棒性方面的局限性。

Method: 利用图信号处理和频率选择性滤波器，基于知识图谱的拉普拉斯特征结构，包含动态图学习、有理滤波器、频谱专家混合、证明引导训练、不确定性量化等扩展功能。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等基准测试中表现出优越的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗扰动鲁棒性和更高的可解释性，优于transformer、消息传递神经网络和神经符号逻辑编程系统。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了可扩展的原则性基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI基于概率模型的取样，缺乏正确性、安全性、公平性等保证，需要统计方法来提高其可靠性

Method: 综述现有研究工作，解释了应用于生成式AI的通用统计技术和方法

Result: 统计方法在提高生成式AI可靠性、改善AI评估质量效率、设计干预实验方面显示出强大潜力

Conclusion: 统计方法为生成式AI提供了重要的可靠性提升途径，虽然存在限制，但未来发展前景广阔

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过语言自我对往（LSP）的强化学习方法，让大语言模型在不需额外训练数据的情况下通过自我对往提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型进步依赖大量训练数据的基础界领瓦瓦，寻找一种无需额外数据的提升方法

Method: 采用游戏理论框架下的自我对往强化学习，将模型能力演化为竞争游戏中的表现，让模型与自身对往来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct模型上的实验显示，通过自我对往单独就能在具有挑战性的任务上提升性能，效果超过依赖数据的基准方法

Conclusion: 语言自我对往为大语言模型的持续改进提供了一种新的途径，能够在不需要额外训练数据的情况下实现性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

### [9] [Instruction Agent: Enhancing Agent with Expert Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07098)
*Yinheng Li,Hailey Hultquist,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Agent是一个GUI代理，通过专家演示来执行复杂任务，严格遵循用户轨迹，避免执行错误，在OSWorld任务上达到60%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长序列操作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 利用单次专家演示提取逐步指令，严格遵循用户轨迹执行，并配备验证器和回溯器模块来处理意外中断和提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在OSWorld测试集上达到60%的成功率，所有顶级代理此前都未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，缩小了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Conclusion: 研究为神经符号建模的关键方面提供了基础分析，旨在激发变革性行动，鼓励社区以新颖方式重新思考这一问题。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

### [11] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一维卷积自编码器和LSTM的深度学习方法来去除皮肤神经活动(SKNA)信号中的肌电(EMG)噪声干扰，显著提高了信噪比和信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交感神经系统(SNS)在调节应激反应中起关键作用，但通过心电图记录的SKNA信号容易受到EMG污染，传统带通滤波方法在持续肌肉活动时效果不佳。

Method: 使用轻量级一维卷积自编码器配合LSTM瓶颈层，从EMG污染的SKNA记录中重建干净信号。采用留一受试者交叉验证框架进行训练。

Result: 方法将信噪比提高了9.65dB，与干净SKNA的相关系数从0.40提升到0.72，在严重噪声水平下对基线vs应激状态的分类准确率达到91-98%。

Conclusion: 深度学习重建方法能够在显著EMG干扰下保留生理相关的交感神经爆发特征，为自然环境中更稳健的SKNA监测提供了可能。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，用于提升Text-to-SQL模型的执行准确率，在工业级数据库和复杂问题上达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用两种管道：(1)新设计的上下文学习框架+群体自评估(语言RL)，使用开源和闭源大语言模型作为骨干；(2)思维链RL管道+小型骨干模型(OmniSQL-7B)，使用特殊设计的奖励函数和两阶段RL训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA，Spider2.0-SQLite上语言RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的Text-to-SQL解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

TL;DR: FETCH分类器用于法律问题分类，通过混合LLM/ML集成方法和自动生成后续问题来提高准确性，在真实数据集上达到97.37%的准确率，性能优于GPT-5且成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线、办公室或律师推荐服务寻求法律帮助，错误分类可能导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权），需要准确的问题分类来匹配正确的法律帮助。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，结合自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实查询的新数据集进行评估。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律帮助的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

Conclusion: 证明了CNN-LSTM混合模型在智能电网安全中的有效性，为网络侵入检测提供了一种高性能的解决方案

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Motivation: 解决非常规气动构型数据稀缺问题，为数据驱动的气动设计代理建模研究提供支持

Method: 通过采样几何设计参数和飞行条件生成数据集，使用PointNet回归器从表面点云预测几何参数，然后通过FiLM网络结合预测参数和飞行条件来预测点状系数(Cp, Cfx, Cfz)

Result: 实验显示在不同BWB构型上表面预测误差较低，数据集包含详细表面量数据用于升力和阻力研究

Conclusion: BlendedNet填补了非常规构型数据空白，为气动数据驱动建模研究提供了重要资源，提出的端到端代理框架在点状气动预测方面表现良好

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文对中间令牌生成(ITG)机制进行了批判性分析，发现中间推理迹路长度与问题难度无明显相关性，而是主要受训练数据分布影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新考察中间令牌生成机制，批判当前学术界将长推理迹路简单解释为"思考"的人类化偏向，探索中间令牌序列长度是否真正反映问题难度

Method: 使用A*搜索算法的演绎迹路从头训练transformer模型，通过迷宫问题的操作数量精确量化问题复杂度，系统评估模型在训练分布内外的表现

Result: 发现模型在简单任务中也会生成过长推理迹路，中间令牌长度与真实A*迹路长度仅呈松散相关，相关性仅在问题接近训练分布时出现

Conclusion: 中间迹路生成并非适应问题难度，而是受训练数据分布影响，长推理序列不能自动解释为"思考努力"，需谨慎解释模型行为

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受AlphaEvolve启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，需要扩展到包含数百个文件和数万行代码的完整代码库规模。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器仓库，同时自我进化其进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中明显优于人类设计的冠军，并在2024基准测试中超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功将LLM代码进化扩展到完整代码库规模，在SAT求解器开发中实现了超越人类专家的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格具有丰富的结构化布局，但手动设计耗时且需要专业知识。现有自动化布局模型不适合电子表格，因为它们忽略了电子表格的离散网格结构和独特的语义关联

Method: 提出SheetDesigner框架，使用多模态大语言模型，结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充，无需训练即可工作

Result: 在3,326个电子表格数据集上评估，SheetDesigner比5个基线方法至少提升22.6%的性能。视觉模态能很好处理重叠和平衡，但对齐仍需改进

Conclusion: 通过混合规则和视觉反射策略，MLLMs能够有效处理电子表格布局生成任务，为自动化电子表格设计提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Motivation: 深度学习在系统动力学建模中虽然提高了可扩展性和预测准确性，但牺牲了解释性和因果可靠性，这在关键决策系统中是不可接受的。

Method: 采用混合方法，将深度学习与概念解释、机制解释、因果机器学习技术相结合，构建基于语义有意义变量的神经网络模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法可以弥合黑盒预测模型与复杂动态环境中关键决策支持需求之间的差距，特别是在工业物联网赋能的网络物理系统中。

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

TL;DR: 基于激活值的指导性提示注入攻击框架，通过能量模型和MCMC采样优化攻击提示，实现了高转移性的黑盒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有白盒/灰盒攻击方法不实用，黑盒攻击转移性差的问题，以应对直接提示注入(DPI)攻击的安全威胁。

Method: 构建基于代理模型激活值的能量模型(EBM)评估对抗提示质量，继而使用标记级Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC)采样适应性优化对抗提示，实现无梯度的黑盒攻击。

Result: 在五个主流LLM上达到49.6%攻击成功率(ASR)，比人工制作提示提升34.6%，在未见任务场景上仍保持36.6%的ASR。

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中发挥关键作用，该框架有效提升了黑盒攻击的转移性能力。

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Motivation: 大语言模型在组织中的采用带来革命性变化，但存在生成离题、歧视或有害内容的风险。现有研究没有考虑组织采用者与黑盒LLM代理之间的信息不对称问题。

Method: 基于套利（合同）理论，进行概念文献分析，使用组织LLM采用阶段和套利理论作为概念框架。

Result: 提供了专门针对组织LLM采用过程中AI对齐方法的扩展文献分析过程，并构建了首个LLM对齐问题-解决方案空间。

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架能够有效减少组织采用LLM过程中的对齐问题，为解决信息不对称和黑盒性质带来的挑战提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理后接符号推理流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图形等不规则数据结构中

Method: 扩展ProbLog并引入图神经网络谓词，将符号表示视为图形，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层处理，支持图神经网络处理符号推理

Result: 在规划、知识图谱补全和GNN表达能力等任务中表现出色，能有效捕获复杂关系依赖，克服现有神经符号系统的关键限制

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图形结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

TL;DR: 提出了Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架，结合用户反馈和增强解码动态来解决LLM推理错误问题，避免错误传播并提升推理深度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理过程中容易生成错误内容，现有自校正方法存在两个关键限制：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号和受限于传统next-token解码范式的推理深度限制

Method: FTR框架仅在收到负面用户反馈时激活响应重新生成，避免错误传播；引入Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多路径推理轨迹的系统探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了LLM推理错误问题，为自校正方法提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

TL;DR: RIMO是一个新的数学奥林匹克竞赛级别基准测试，包含两个轨道：RIMO-N（335个有唯一整数答案的问题）和RIMO-P（456个需要证明的问题），旨在消除评估噪声并提供更准确的LLM数学推理能力评估。

Motivation: 现有的奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏差问题，如异构答案格式需要基于模型的评判器，以及依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案。

Method: 创建两个轨道：RIMO-N重写IMO问题使其具有唯一整数答案，实现确定性正确性检查；RIMO-P提供专家检查的证明问题，分解为子问题序列，通过自动化评分系统评估逐步推理过程。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优异，但在RIMO上的性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的显著差距，为未来研究提供了具有挑战性且易于评估的高分辨率基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过批判模型自我评估置信度来动态调整推理过程，在保证准确性的同时显著减少计算资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型通常使用固定的推理token预算，但不同问题的推理需求差异很大。固定预算可能导致过度推理或推理不足，需要一种自适应机制来平衡效率和可靠性

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批判模型定期评估自身推理置信度。当置信度达到目标阈值时提前终止推理，否则继续推理直到满足置信要求

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率同时减少token使用量。64次多种子实验显示方法稳定，减少方差，在惩罚性评分下表现更好。可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有效信号。CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究比较了矩阵基和图基RAG在教育问答中的性能，发现矩阵RAG适合低成本事实查找，图基RAG更适合主题性问题，建议使用动态分支框架优化查询路由


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性

Method: 使用EduScopeQA数据集(3,176个问题)，比较矩阵基检索(OpenAI Vector Search RAG)和图基检索(GraphRAG)在不同教育学科和问题类型上的表现，包括使用系统性修改的教科书进行测试

Result: 矩阵RAG在低成本事实查找中表现良好，GraphRAG Global在主题性问题中提供更丰富的教育回答，GraphRAG Local在质量关键的素材中准确率最高，动态分支框架能夠提升效率和准确性

Conclusion: 不同RAG方法在教育环境中各有优势，建议根据查询类型选择适合的检索方法，动态分支框架可以最大化系统性能和效果

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖于从专有大模型精粲的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本高昂。需要尝试利用小规模开源LLM作为合成器来构建高质量代码指令数据。

Method: 提出迭代自我精粲方法：1)多检查点采样和多方面评分策略进行初始数据选择；2)基于梯度的影响力估计方法进行最终数据过滤；3)从小规模合成器获取代码指令数据集，基于DeepSeek-Coder进行微调。

Result: 基于该方法开发的SCoder代码生成模型家族达到了目前最先进的代码生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了对专有大模型的依赖，降低了成本，并能够训练出独立的高性能代码生成模型。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程虽然具有强大的问题解决能力，但其复杂的建模语言、大量的全局约束和建模技巧阻碍了非专家用户的使用。从自然语言直接生成专家级模型还很困难，因此需要一种更实用的方法。

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型构建数据库，通过检索算法根据用户自然语言描述的问题，从数据库中匹配最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注。

Result: 实验显示，该系统在不同专业水平的用户问题描述下，都能以很高的准确率检索到正确的模型。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过检索专家验证的模型库，有效降低了约束编程的使用门槛，为非专家用户提供了实用的建模辅助工具。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试存在两大缺陷：缺乏对真实物理竞赛（如物理奥林匹克）的系统性覆盖，且无法实现与人类选手的直接性能比较。

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥林匹克竞赛试题，涵盖文本和图表混合模态；采用官方评分方案进行细粒度评分；基于官方奖牌阈值给模型分配金、银、铜牌。

Result: 评估30个先进(M)LLM显示：开源MLLM大多处于铜牌水平；开源LLM偶尔能获金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；所有模型距离满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现强大物理推理能力，仍有很大改进空间。HiPhO作为严谨的人类对齐基准测试已开源。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

TL;DR: 开发了测量语言模型福利的新实验范式，比较了模型的口头偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为偏好，发现陈述偏好与行为之间存在可靠相关性，表明偏好满足可作为AI系统福利的实证测量代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发新的实验范式来测量语言模型的福利状态，探索语言模型的偏好表达和行为一致性，为AI系统的福利测量提供实证基础。

Method: 使用口头报告和虚拟环境行为两种方式测量模型偏好，测试成本和奖励对行为的影响，并通过语义等效提示测试幸福福利量表的一致性。

Result: 观察到测量方法之间存在显著的一致性支持，陈述偏好与行为在不同条件下存在可靠相关性，但一致性在不同模型和条件下表现不一，且对扰动不具一致性。

Conclusion: 虽然目前不确定这些方法是否成功测量了语言模型的福利状态，但研究结果凸显了在语言模型中进行福利测量的可行性，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

Motivation: 解决GNN在源代码漏洞检测中因训练数据不平衡和标签噪声导致的伪相关性学习问题，提高检测器的鲁棒性和泛化性能

Method: 使用LLM生成反事实样本，进行针对性GNN训练，结合图解释性技术识别关键代码语句

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升至97.8%，配对对比准确率从4.5%提升至95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升至85.5%

Conclusion: VISION框架通过反事实训练有效缓解伪相关性学习，为构建透明可信的AI网络安全系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

### [37] [Optimal streaming algorithm for detecting $\ell_2$ heavy hitters in random order streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07286)
*Santhoshini Velusamy,Huacheng Yu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对随机顺序流的最优空间算法，用于检测ℓ₂重击者，空间复杂度为O(1/ε log n)，适用于ε=Ω(1/2^√log n)的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在插入流中检测ℓ₂重击者时，BPTree算法在常数ε时空间最优但ε=o(1)时可能次优，需要探索在随机顺序流中实现最优空间复杂度的方法。

Method: 利用随机顺序流的特性，其中流元素可以是敌意的但到达顺序是均匀随机的，设计算法实现最优空间复杂度。对于部分随机顺序流，还需要预先获得F₂的常数近似值。

Result: 在随机顺序流中实现了O(1/ε log n)的最优空间复杂度，适用于ε=Ω(1/2^√log n)的范围。对于部分随机顺序流，在给定F₂常数近似的前提下也能达到相同空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 随机顺序流的特性使得ℓ₂重击者检测可以达到理论最优空间复杂度，突破了确定性流模型下的空间限制，为流算法设计提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Given a stream $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ of items from a Universe $U$ of size
$\mathsf{poly}(n)$, and a parameter $\epsilon>0$, an item $i\in U$ is said to
be an $\ell_2$ heavy hitter if its frequency $f_i$ in the stream is at least
$\sqrt{\epsilon F_2}$, where $F_2=\sqrt{\sum_{i\in U} f_i^2}$. The classical
$\mathsf{CountSketch}$ algorithm due to Charikar, Chen, and Farach-Colton
[2004], was the first algorithm to detect $\ell_2$ heavy hitters using
$O\left(\frac{\log^2 n}{\epsilon}\right)$ bits of space, and their algorithm is
optimal for streams with deletions. For insertion-only streams, Braverman,
Chestnut, Ivkin, Nelson, Wang, and Woodruff [2017] gave the $\mathsf{BPTree}$
algorithm which requires only $O\left(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}\log n
\right)$ space. Note that any algorithm requires at least
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log n\right)$ space to output $O(1/\epsilon)$ heavy
hitters in the worst case. So for constant $\epsilon$, the space usage of the
$\mathsf{BPTree}$ algorithm is optimal but their bound could be sub-optimal for
$\epsilon=o(1)$. In this work, we show that for random order streams, where the
stream elements can be adversarial but their order of arrival is uniformly
random, it is possible to achieve the optimal space bound of
$O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log n\right)$ for every $\epsilon =
\Omega\left(\frac{1}{2^{\sqrt{\log n}}}\right)$. We also show that for
partially random order streams where only the heavy hitters are required to be
uniformly distributed in the stream, it is possible to achieve the same space
bound, but with an additional assumption that the algorithm is given a constant
approximation to $F_2$ in advance.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了离散设置下的聚类维度约简，提出了基于数据集双倍维度的新维度边界，相比连续设置有不同的理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Johnson-Lindenstrauss变换是欧几里得空间中维度约简的基础方法，但一般维度边界O(log n)对于特定问题可以突破。虽然连续设置下的聚类问题已有显著进展，但离散设置下的维度约简研究相对不足。

Method: 针对离散聚类设置（中心点只能从数据集中选取），提出了两个基于数据集双倍维度(ddim)的结果：第一个结果达到维度O_ε(ddim + log k + log log n)，第二个结果通过放松保证条件消除了log log n项。

Result: 证明了在离散设置下，维度约简可以达到O_ε(ddim + log k + log log n)的紧边界，并且通过放松保证条件可以进一步消除log log n项，同时保持对下游应用的实用性。

Conclusion: 离散设置下的维度约简与连续设置不仅在维度边界上不同（依赖于双倍维度），而且在保持最优值之外的保证方面也存在差异，如哪些聚类结果被保持。

Abstract: The Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform is a fundamental method for dimension
reduction in Euclidean spaces, that can map any dataset of $n$ points into
dimension $O(\log n)$ with low distortion of their distances. This dimension
bound is tight in general, but one can bypass it for specific problems. Indeed,
tremendous progress has been made for clustering problems, especially in the
\emph{continuous} setting where centers can be picked from the ambient space
$\mathbb{R}^d$. Most notably, for $k$-median and $k$-means, the dimension bound
was improved to $O(\log k)$ [Makarychev, Makarychev and Razenshteyn, STOC
2019].
  We explore dimension reduction for clustering in the \emph{discrete} setting,
where centers can only be picked from the dataset, and present two results that
are both parameterized by the doubling dimension of the dataset, denoted as
$\operatorname{ddim}$. The first result shows that dimension
$O_{\epsilon}(\operatorname{ddim} + \log k + \log\log n)$ suffices, and is
moreover tight, to guarantee that the cost is preserved within factor
$1\pm\epsilon$ for every set of centers. Our second result eliminates the
$\log\log n$ term in the dimension through a relaxation of the guarantee
(namely, preserving the cost only for all approximately-optimal sets of
centers), which maintains its usefulness for downstream applications.
  Overall, we achieve strong dimension reduction in the discrete setting, and
find that it differs from the continuous setting not only in the dimension
bound, which depends on the doubling dimension, but also in the guarantees
beyond preserving the optimal value, such as which clusterings are preserved.

Abstract: An important thread in the study of data-stream algorithms focuses on
settings where stream items are active only for a limited time. We introduce a
new expiration model, where each item arrives with its own expiration time. The
special case where items expire in the order that they arrive, which we call
consistent expirations, contains the classical sliding-window model of Datar,
Gionis, Indyk, and Motwani [SICOMP 2002] and its timestamp-based variant of
Braverman and Ostrovsky [FOCS 2007].
  Our first set of results presents algorithms (in the expiration streaming
model) for several fundamental problems, including approximate counting,
uniform sampling, and weighted sampling by efficiently tracking active items
without explicitly storing them all. Naturally, these algorithms have many
immediate applications to other problems.
  Our second and main set of results designs algorithms (in the expiration
streaming model) for the diameter and $k$-center problems, where items are
points in a metric space. Our results significantly extend those known for the
special case of sliding-window streams by Cohen-Addad, Schwiegelshohn, and
Sohler [ICALP 2016], including also a strictly better approximation factor for
the diameter in the important special case of high-dimensional Euclidean space.
We develop new decomposition and coordination techniques along with a geometric
dominance framework, to filter out redundant points based on both temporal and
spatial proximity.

Motivation: 填补数据流F2估计问题在小误差范围内的理论空白，解决已知Ω(n)下界与O(n log n)上界之间的差距，为高精度频率矩估计提供完整的空间复杂度刻画

Method: 通过完全刻画集合交集大小估计的双向通信复杂度，证明当ε<n^{-1/2-Ω(1)}时单向通信协议需要Ω(n log n)下界，并设计了两遍流算法使用O(n log log n)空间精确计算直方图

Result: 证明了对于所有ε≥1/n²，最优空间复杂度为Θ(min(n,1/ε²)·(1+|log(ε²n)|))比特，首次实现了一通和O(1)通小频率矩估计的空间复杂度渐近分离

Conclusion: 高精度频率矩估计本质上需要存储整个流，两遍流算法相比单遍算法在空间效率上有显著优势，为流算法设计提供了新的理论洞见

Abstract: Estimating the second frequency moment $F_2$ of a data stream up to a $(1 \pm
\varepsilon)$ factor is a central problem in the streaming literature. For
errors $\varepsilon > \Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$, the tight bound
$\Theta\left(\log(\varepsilon^2 n)/\varepsilon^2\right)$ was recently
established by Braverman and Zamir. In this work, we complete the picture by
resolving the remaining regime of small error, $\varepsilon < 1/\sqrt{n}$,
showing that the optimal space complexity is $\Theta\left( \min\left(n,
\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \right) \cdot \left(1 + \left| \log(\varepsilon^2 n)
\right| \right) \right)$ bits for all $\varepsilon \geq 1/n^2$, assuming a
sufficiently large universe. This closes the gap between the best known
$\Omega(n)$ lower bound and the straightforward $O(n \log n)$ upper bound in
that range, and shows that essentially storing the entire stream is necessary
for high-precision estimation.
  To derive this bound, we fully characterize the two-party communication
complexity of estimating the size of a set intersection up to an arbitrary
additive error $\varepsilon n$. In particular, we prove a tight $\Omega(n \log
n)$ lower bound for one-way communication protocols when $\varepsilon <
n^{-1/2-\Omega(1)}$, in contrast to classical $O(n)$-bit protocols that use
two-way communication. Motivated by this separation, we present a two-pass
streaming algorithm that computes the exact histogram of a stream with high
probability using only $O(n \log \log n)$ bits of space, in contrast to the
$\Theta(n \log n)$ bits required in one pass even to approximate $F_2$ with
small error. This yields the first asymptotic separation between one-pass and
$O(1)$-passes space complexity for small frequency moment estimation.

TL;DR: 本文对近似最近邻搜索的邻近图方法提出了新的理论见解，构建了边数更少、构建时间接近线性的算法，并给出了下界证明，同时在欧几里得空间中进一步优化了图大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻近图方法已成为近似最近邻搜索的主流范式，但现有构建方法存在时间复杂度高（Ω(n²)）的问题，需要从理论上重新审视其基础并寻求更优的构建算法。

Method: 提出了一种构建邻近图的新算法，保证(1+ε)-近似最近邻搜索，具有O((1/ε)^λ·n log Δ)边数和(1/ε)^λ·polylog Δ查询时间，其中λ是度量空间的倍增维度。构建时间接近线性。

Result: 算法构建时间从之前的Ω(n²)改进到接近线性，同时给出了下界证明：最坏情况下边数至少需要Ω((1/ε)^λ·n + n log Δ)。在欧几里得空间中，边数可进一步减少到O((1/ε)^λ·n)。

Conclusion: 邻近图方法存在固有的边数限制，但在欧几里得空间等几何空间中可以利用几何特性进一步优化图结构，实现更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Proximity graph-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in the system community. This paper
presents fresh insights into the theoretical foundation of these methods. We
describe an algorithm to build a proximity graph for $(1+\epsilon)$-ANN search
that has $O((1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot n \log \Delta)$ edges and guarantees
$(1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot \text{polylog }\Delta$ query time. Here, $n$ and
$\Delta$ are the size and aspect ratio of the data input, respectively, and
$\lambda = O(1)$ is the doubling dimension of the underlying metric space. Our
construction time is near-linear to $n$, improving the $\Omega(n^2)$ bounds of
all previous constructions. We complement our algorithm with lower bounds
revealing an inherent limitation of proximity graphs: the number of edges needs
to be at least $\Omega((1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot n + n \log \Delta)$ in the
worst case, up to a subpolynomial factor. The hard inputs used in our
lower-bound arguments are non-geometric, thus prompting the question of whether
improvement is possible in the Euclidean space (a key subclass of metric
spaces). We provide an affirmative answer by using geometry to reduce the graph
size to $O((1/\epsilon)^\lambda \cdot n)$ while preserving nearly the same
query and construction time.

TL;DR: 本文首次为分段线性近似(PLA)建立了压缩和索引设置下的空间下界，并设计了达到这些下界的简洁数据结构，支持高效查询操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PLA是学习数据结构中的核心组件，但缺乏理论上的压缩性分析。需要建立PLA的压缩极限理论并设计最优存储方案。

Method: 引入PLA在压缩和索引设置下的首个空间下界证明，设计新颖的数据结构达到这些下界，支持高效段检索和评估。

Result: 证明了所提数据结构在空间复杂度上达到理论下界（常数因子内最优），在大多数实际情况下是简洁的，支持高效查询操作。

Conclusion: 首次为PLA基学习数据结构提供了最大可压缩性理论分析，提出了具有强理论保证的新型存储方案，同时支持简单高效的实际实现。

Abstract: We study the problem of deriving compressibility measures for \emph{Piecewise
Linear Approximations} (PLAs), i.e., error-bounded approximations of a set of
two-dimensional {\em increasing} data points using a sequence of segments. Such
approximations are widely used tools in implementing many \emph{learned data
structures}, which mix learning models with traditional algorithmic design
blocks to exploit regularities in the underlying data distribution, providing
novel and effective space-time trade-offs.
  We introduce the first lower bounds to the cost of storing PLAs in two
settings, namely {\em compression} and {\em indexing}. We then compare these
compressibility measures to known data structures, and show that they are
asymptotically optimal up to a constant factor from the space lower bounds.
Finally, we design the first data structures for the aforementioned settings
that achieve the space lower bounds plus small additive terms, which turn out
to be {\em succinct} in most practical cases. Our data structures support the
efficient retrieval and evaluation of a segment in the (compressed) PLA for a
given $x$-value, which is a core operation in any learned data structure
relying on PLAs.
  As a result, our paper offers the first theoretical analysis of the maximum
compressibility achievable by PLA-based learned data structures, and provides
novel storage schemes for PLAs offering strong theoretical guarantees while
also suggesting simple and efficient practical implementations.

*Xueyi Wang,Elisabeth Wilhelm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的个性化两阶段自适应时空模型，用于预测睡眠质量分数，结合多尺度卷积层、循环层和注意力机制，并通过两阶段域适应策略增强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康有重要影响，医疗保健提供者和个人需要可访问且可靠的预测工具来进行预防性干预。

Method: 使用多尺度卷积层建模空间交互，循环层和注意力机制捕捉长期时间依赖，采用两阶段域适应策略（训练时适应和测试时无源适应）来提升泛化性能。

Result: 模型在多种输入窗口和预测窗口设置下均优于基线方法，最佳性能为3天输入窗口和1天预测窗口，RMSE为0.216；即使在较长预测窗口（如3天预测窗口RMSE为0.257）也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据实现个性化睡眠预测提供了鲁棒、自适应和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

TL;DR: GSTBench是首个系统评估图自监督学习方法跨数据集迁移能力的基准测试，发现大多数方法迁移效果不佳，而GraphMAE表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单一数据集上开发和评估，缺乏对跨数据集迁移性的系统研究，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的应用。

Method: 在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多样化目标图上的表现，标准化实验设置分离混杂因素。

Result: 大多数图SSL方法泛化能力差，有些甚至比随机初始化更差；GraphMAE（掩码自编码器方法）能持续提升迁移性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图SSL方法的迁移性差异，为图学习的"预训练-迁移"范式奠定了基础，并为未来可迁移图SSL研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 将人类知识和经验融入交通预测模型能够显著提升预测准确性和鲁棒性，证明了知识引导的跨模态学习方法在智能交通系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 这是一个配置先行框架，用于评估深度学习系统在CPU、GPU和编译运行时之间的跨后端兼容性。通过672次检测发现运72.0%运行通过，检测模型和编译后端容易出现偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在不同运行后端（CPU、GPU、编译运行时）上部署时出现的结果不一致问题，提供系统化的跨后端偏差量化和缓解方法。

Method: 使用YAML配置文件解耦实验与代码，支持库和仓库模型，采用三层验证协议（张量级别接近度、激活对齐、任务级指标）。

Result: 在672次检测中72.0%运行通过，大多数差异出现在更严格的容差阈值下。检测模型和编译后端容易出现偏差，通常因非确定性后处理造成。

Conclusion: 确定性适配器和选择性回退机制可显著提高一致性而不伤害性能。该框架是首个系统化量化和缓解深度学习跨后端偏差的统一方法，为异构运行时上的可靠部署提供可复现方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Main category: cs.LG

Motivation: 传统代理模型在高维随机变量下遭遇"维度灾难"，现有HDMR方法主要针对优化问题，缺乏专门针对可靠性分析的研究，而可靠性分析更关注关键区域的预测精度。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1)为所有随机变量开发单变量子代理模型；2)识别耦合变量子代理模型需求；3)构建耦合变量子代理模型。基于各阶段特点制定实验设计样本选择的优化数学模型，采用无候选样本池方法选择信息样本。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在解决高维可靠性问题时实现了高计算效率，同时保持了强大的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 所提出的Kriging-HDMR主动学习方法能有效处理高维可靠性分析问题，在计算效率和预测精度方面都表现出色，为高维可靠性工程问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 公交车达时预测方法NSATP，通过时间序列稳定化和非稳定性恢复两阶段，在保持预测性能的同时利用非稳定性特征，在电车和公交车预测中都取得了更优的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步达时预测中，非稳定性数据会降低模型性能，但传统的标准化方法可能会隐藏非稳定性中的有用特征（过度稳定化问题）。需要在预测性能和非稳定性之间寻找平衡。

Method: 提出两阶段方法NSATP：1）时间序列稳定化阶段提高预测性能；2）非稳定性效应恢复阶段，将一维方法扩展到二维模型以抓取隐藏周期性，并设计补偿模块学习缩放和偏移因子。

Result: 在德約斯顿125天公交运营数据上验证，NSATP方法与基线方法相比：电车RMSE、MAE、MAPE分别降低2.37%、1.22%、2.26%；公交车分别降低1.72%、0.60%、1.17%。

Conclusion: NSATP方法通过稳定化和非稳定性恢复的结合，有效地平衡了预测性能和非稳定性特征的利用，在公交车达时预测任务中取得了更优的性能。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Result: 在Qwen3-4B上达到0.486的NQ测试分数，超越Qwen2.5-7B模型，训练吞吐量提升6.8倍

Conclusion: RLFactory为现实场景中LLM的多轮工具使用提供了低门槛、高适应性的强化解决方案

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在现实应用中需要确保输出安全性，但现有解码时干预方法往往在安全性和响应质量之间做出严重妥协

Method: 提出包含三个关键组件的CARE框架：1）实时安全监控的守卫模型；2）带令牌缓冲区的回滚机制；3）基于自省的干预策略，让模型生成自我反思并纳入上下文指导后续解码

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率方面达到优越平衡，有害响应率低，用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时纠正和有效自校正，实现了优越的安全-质量权衡，为解码时安全对齐提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Motivation: 基础模型参数量大导致部署困难，现有联邦LoRA方法假设统一秩配置和单模态输入，忽略了客户端资源异构性和多模态数据中可能缺失模态的现实挑战

Method: 提出维度聚合策略重新加权LoRA更新，避免信息稀释；采用轻量级分层模型编辑方法选择性整合全局参数修复本地组件

Conclusion: FediLoRA有效解决了联邦学习中异构LoRA秩和模态缺失问题，为多模态联邦学习提供了简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Motivation: 当前缺乏形式化的单次扫描方法来量化Transformer电路的一致性和可信质量

Result: 提供了白盒、单次扫描的无维度分数方法，包括分数解释、计算开销和植物分析指南

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的一致性和可靠性提供了形式化的方法，实验验证尚未完成

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Conclusion: 该机器学习方法能够实现快速而准确的流行病模型参数检定，尽管某些参数存在识别性问题，但能更准确地重现流行曲线

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于离散事件模拟的简单时序DRL环境用于柔性作业车间调度问题(FJSP)，并基于PPO算法构建端到端DRL调度模型，通过新的状态表示和奖励函数设计提升了调度性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的深度强化学习方法主要关注DRL调度智能体的设计，而忽略了DRL环境的建模，需要开发更有效的环境建模方法来提升FJSP调度性能。

Method: 基于离散事件模拟构建时序DRL环境，使用近端策略优化(PPO)算法建立端到端调度模型，提出基于两个状态变量的短状态表示和基于机器调度区域的可理解奖励函数。

Result: 在公共基准实例上的实验表明，简单优先级调度规则在该环境中性能得到提升，所提出的DRL调度模型相比OR-Tools、元启发式、DRL和PDR方法具有竞争优势。

Conclusion: 所提出的简单时序DRL环境和调度模型为FJSP提供了有效的解决方案，通过改进环境建模和状态奖励设计显著提升了调度性能。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯方法需要为所有参数建立概率模型，这阻碍了复杂结构约束的融入，需要更简约的框架来处理这类问题。

Method: 采用简约贝叶斯框架，仅对关键参数设置先验，通过轮廓似然消除冗余参数。开发了MINTS（简约汤普森采样）算法作为具体实现。

Result: 框架能处理结构化问题（如连续臂Lipschitz赌博机和动态定价），为经典凸优化算法提供概率视角，并在多臂赌博机问题上实现了接近最优的遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 该简约贝叶斯框架成功解决了传统方法难以处理复杂约束的问题，为序列决策提供了新的有效工具，并在理论和应用层面都取得了良好结果。

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过结合因果发现和不确定性感知预测方法，更好地理解宏观经济指标间的动态因果关系，并为经济政策制定提供更稳健的预测工具。

Method: 使用LPCMCI框架和Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC)方法分析1970-2021年季度数据，发现因果关系；利用Chronos大型语言模型进行零样本概率预测。

Result: 发现经济增长对GDP存在稳健单向因果关系，通胀连通性有限；失业率预测在1-2个季度范围内准确，提供90%置信区间，支持异常检测。

Conclusion: 研究表明将因果结构学习与概率语言模型结合，能够为经济政策提供信息并增强预测稳健性，展示了该方法在金融时间序列分析中的价值。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Motivation: 解决AI在光伏监测中的可解释性障碍，确保深度学习模型的决策与热物理原理一致，以消除能源基础设施应用中的部署疑虑。

Method: 系统比较ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0等CNN模型与ViT-Tiny、Swin-Tiny等视觉Transformer模型，使用XRAI显著性分析评估模型决策与热物理原理的一致性，基于20,000张红外图像进行评测。

Result: Swin Transformer获得最高性能（94%二元准确率，73%多类别准确率），XRAI分析显示模型学习到了物理意义特征，如局部热点、线性热道等。但电气故障检测效果优秀（F1分数>0.90），环境因素如污染检测仍靠挑战（F1分数0.20-0.33）。

Conclusion: 热物理导向的可解释性方法为验证AI在能源监测中的决策提供了方法论支撑，有助于光伏监测系统的可靠部署，但热成像分辨率对某些故障类型的检测仍形成限制。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型中，高维线性映射（线性层）占据了大部分参数和计算成本，需要找到更好的容量与推理成本权衡方案。

Method: 使用查找多元Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（lmKANs），通过可训练低维多元函数表达高维映射，这些函数作为样条查找表实现，只需少量乘法即可计算。

Result: lmKANs将推理FLOPs降低达6.0倍，在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1k上分别减少1.6-2.1倍和1.7倍FLOPs，在甲烷配置数据集上实现10倍以上H100吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: lmKANs提供了线性层的高效替代方案，在保持模型灵活性和精度的同时显著降低计算成本，适用于各种深度学习架构。

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

Motivation: 传统的欧几里得归一化层不适用于流形数据，而许多机器学习中的黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，需要一种理论上有保证的黎曼批量归一化方法。

Conclusion: GyroBN提供了一个理论上有保证的通用框架，成功将批量归一化扩展到非欧几里得流形，代码已开源。

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

Conclusion: 表格化重构为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了新的潜力，证明了TFMs在图领域的适用性

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端数据分布随时间演化且存在显著异构性，导致标准FL算法性能下降的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段客户端学习本地模型提取特征表示；第二阶段服务器基于表示动态聚类客户端，协调集群级任务特定模型训练。

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证表明Fed-REACT在真实数据集上实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Fed-REACT有效解决了联邦学习中的异构数据挑战，为实际部署提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

Method: 分析量化过程中权重和激活值变化如何导致网络级联影响，研究梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值的变化，提出结合混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)、数据采样方法和加权损失函数的解决方案。

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加、群体准确率受损，对少数群体影响更严重。通过梯度范数和Hessian分析揭示了从优化角度看的网络状态变化。

Conclusion: 量化会加剧模型的不公平性，需要采用混合精度QAT与公平性技术相结合的方法来实现量化神经网络的公平部署。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive
performance characterization.

*Shalev Manor,Mohammad Kohandel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP-Basis PINNs是一种元学习框架，通过离线-在线分解解决多查询逆问题，大幅减少计算开销，实现快速高效的参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在多查询逆问题中计算成本高昂，每个新的观测数据集都需要重新训练，效率低下。

Method: 采用离线-在线分解：离线训练深度网络生成基函数，在线冻结网络仅训练轻量级线性输出层，结合前向自动微分和新型损失函数。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异，包括常数和函数参数估计，相比标准PINNs显著加速，在稀缺和噪声数据下鲁棒运行。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为多查询逆问题提供了高效解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Alexandrovna Studenikina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCond是一种基于PCGrad原理的梯度冲突解决方法，通过梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制实现计算效率提升，在保持优化质量的同时获得两倍计算加速，并在多个数据集和模型架构上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题严重，现有方法如PCGrad、CAGrad和GradNorm计算成本高，限制了它们在现代大模型和Transformer中的应用。

Method: 提出Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，结合PCGrad原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，提供随机模式和确定性模式两种实现。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈CT数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上表现优越，获得更低的L1和SSIM损失，计算速度提升两倍，且在MobileNetV3-Small和ConvNeXt等不同规模模型上都具有良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，与现代优化器兼容，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个基于变分贝叶斯推理的鲁棒框架，从噪声稀疏的相空间数据中无监督学习广义哈密顿动力学，能够处理保守、耗散和端口哈密顿系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统哈密顿网络模型难以从采样的相空间轨迹中捕捉不同物理系统（保守、耗散、端口哈密顿系统）的独特运动动力学和物理特性，需要一个统一的框架来处理这种复杂的哈密顿流形学习挑战。

Method: 扩展稀疏辛随机傅里叶高斯过程学习，结合哈密顿景观的预测性连续数值估计，使用广义的状态和共轭动量哈密顿动力学形式。除了核化ELBO损失函数外，还加入稳定性和守恒约束作为超参数平衡的损失项来正则化模型的多梯度。

Result: 该方法能够以有界不确定性提高预测精度，强制物理正确性，适用于不同类型的物理系统。

Conclusion: 该框架为从噪声稀疏数据中学习广义哈密顿动力学提供了一个有效的无监督方法，通过结合变分推理和物理约束，实现了对复杂物理系统动力学的准确建模。

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密码破解作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，模型需要从26!种可能的映射中选择，而无需显式访问密码。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用仅编码器Transformer和新型双射解码头，通过Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法显式建模排列，实现直接提取学习到的密码映射。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个唯一密码（占可能密码空间的3.7×10^{-24}）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，实现了最先进的准确性和速度。

Conclusion: 该架构创新和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: 这个框架在准确性、可解释性和满足监管要求之间取得平衡，降低注释成本，为自动化临床决策支持提供可扩展的途径。

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用人口统计预训练模型(GDP)，专门针对年龄和性别特征进行表示学习，通过顺序排序策略和编码方法将表格型人口统计数据转换为潜在嵌入，在多种疾病数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的人口统计属性是临床风险分层和治疗决策的重要预测因子，但在模型设计中往往被置于辅助角色，缺乏专门的表示学习方法。

Method: 开发GDP预训练模型，探索不同的排序策略和编码方法，将表格型人口统计输入转换为潜在嵌入表示，并在不同地理区域、不同疾病和人群组成的数据集上进行预训练和评估。

Result: 顺序排序策略显著提升了模型在判别、校准和决策树分裂信息增益方面的性能，特别是在年龄和性别对风险分层贡献显著的疾病中。即使在人口统计属性预测价值较低的数据集中，GDP也能增强其表示重要性。

Conclusion: 针对表格型人口统计属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群泛化，为提高医疗健康应用的预测性能提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

TL;DR: FedTeddi是一种针对联邦边缘学习中动态非IID数据的时间漂移和分歧感知调度算法，通过联合调度和带宽分配实现快速收敛


<details>

Motivation: 现实场景中客户端数据具有时变和非IID特性，需要及时有效地适应这种动态数据演化

Method: 使用时序漂移和集体分歧量化数据动态特性，提出基于EMD距离的优化目标，开发联合调度和带宽分配算法

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上相比随机调度分别提升58.4%和49.2%的收敛速度，获得更高的测试精度

Conclusion: FedTeddi算法能有效处理动态数据演化，在通信资源限制下实现快速收敛和知识保持

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Motivation: 现有的神经网络权重隐式表示方法存在明显的频谱偏差，难以有效重建高频细节，限制了参数压缩效果

Method: 提出SBS方法：1）单向排序平滑改善输出空间核平滑度；2）基于排序平滑的自适应随机傅里叶特征，根据层参数数量调制输入编码频率带宽

Result: 在ResNet模型和CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet数据集上的广泛评估显示，SBS相比SOTA方法以更少参数获得显著更好的重建精度

Conclusion: SBS通过有效抑制频谱偏差，为神经网络权重压缩提供了参数效率更高的增强方案

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection

creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DPH-RL框架，通过使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，解决RLVR微调中多尝试性能退化问题，在保持多样性的同时提升单次和多次尝试准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法在微调大语言模型时经常导致多尝试性能（Pass@k）下降和灾难性遗忘，缺乏有效的知识保留机制。反向KL散度会加速知识衰减，而无散度项则无法防止模型偏离其多样化的知识库。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，通过持续参考初始策略来强制模型保持广泛的解决方案覆盖范围。该方法使用生成函数计算f-散度，只需从初始策略采样，无需在线参考模型。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的大量实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还提高了域内和域外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是构建更通用和多样化推理模型的有力工具，DPH-RL为改进RLVR提供了一个关键但被忽视的维度。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了水需求预测的准确性，还能够识别具体的消费行为模式，为水务管理提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoseCDL是一个可扩展且鲁棒的卷积字典学习算法，用于长信号中的无监督罕见事件检测，通过随机窗口和在线异常检测解决了传统CDL的计算成本和异常敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积字典学习(CDL)在建模信号局部结构方面很强大，但在检测罕见或异常事件方面应用有限，主要面临高计算成本和对异常值敏感两大挑战。

Method: RoseCDL结合了随机窗口技术（用于大数据集高效训练）和在线异常检测（增强鲁棒性并隔离异常模式），将CDL重构为实用的异常事件发现工具。

Result: 该方法使CDL能够扩展到处理大规模信号，同时保持对罕见事件的检测能力，超越了传统CDL在压缩和去噪等任务中的应用范围。

Conclusion: RoseCDL为天文学、物理模拟和生物医学科学等领域的罕见事件检测提供了一个实用的无监督学习框架，扩展了CDL在真实世界信号分析中的应用价值。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ΔL归一化方法，解决RLVR训练中响应长度变化导致的梯度方差大和优化不稳定问题，通过理论分析和实验验证其无偏性和最小方差特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示强大潜力，但训练过程中响应长度的大幅变化导致高梯度方差和不稳定优化，现有方法存在估计偏差或高方差问题

Method: 通过理论分析不同长度对策略损失的影响，将问题重构为寻找最小方差无偏估计量，提出ΔL归一化方法

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在不同模型大小、最大长度和任务上都能取得优越结果

Conclusion: ΔL归一化是一种简单有效的损失聚合方法，能够提供无偏的策略损失估计并最小化梯度方差，在RLVR训练中表现优异

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经元仅使用加权和非线性激活函数，缺乏概率解释和不确定性捕捉能力。uGMM-NN旨在将概率论推理直接嵌入神经网络的计算单元中。

Method: 每个uGMM-NN节点将激活值当作单元正态混合模型进行参数化，包含可学习的均值、方差和混合系数，以捕捉多模态特征。

Result: uGMM-NN在辨别性能力上与传统多层感知机相比具有竞争力，同时还能提供激活值的概率解释。

Conclusion: 该框架为将不确定性意识组件集成到现代神经网络架构中奠定了基础，为辨别性和生成性建模打开了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了PINN的双重公式化方法，用于处理具有不连续系数的材料均质化问题，提供可靠的上界和下界误差估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN在处理具有不连续系数（如分段常数属性）的材料时经常失败，需要更可靠的方法来解决周期性热导复合材料的均质化问题

Method: 引入双重公式化到PINN框架，比较标准PINN与变分PINN(VPINN)，使用谱和神经网络基测试函数，为强形式和变分形式提供保证误差边界

Result: 强形式PINN在受控环境下可能优于VPINN，但对材料不连续性敏感且缺乏明确诊断；VPINN能直接处理分段常数参数但需要仔细选择测试函数

Conclusion: 双重公式化作为收敛质量的可靠指标，集成到PINN框架中增强了其在微观力学均质化问题中的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法GinAR缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式，需要解决变量缺失对时空图神经网络建模变量间相关性的挑战

Method: 集成不确定性感知插值(UAI)和高斯核图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重建值不确定性，双向递归单元增强时间依赖性建模

Result: 在各种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能

Conclusion: IBN为具有缺失变量的多元时间序列预测提供了更可靠和可解释的框架

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Motivation: MoE模型在有限GPU内存下的高效服务面临挑战，将非激活专家卸载到主存需要解决数据传输问题，需要探索有效的专家压缩方法并分析压缩误差对推理性能的影响

Method: 采用误差有界损失压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，通过大量实验分析不同层次专家压缩误差对整体推理精度的影响

Result: 浅层专家（负责注意力机制和输入转换）对压缩误差敏感度低；中层专家（负责模型推理）压缩误差会显著降低推理精度；深层专家（负责指令跟随和输出整合）的压缩误差有时反而能提高推理精度

Conclusion: 误差有界压缩是减少MoE模型数据传输开销的有效方法，不同层次专家对压缩误差的敏感性不同，需要分层采用不同的压缩策略

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial

effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

TL;DR: 基于多组学数据（影像组学和放射组学）的支持向量回归模型，用于预测脑转移癌肿体积连续变化，在PULSAR治疗中提供个性化方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测脑部转移癌肿体积（GTV）变化对PULSAR治疗具有重要的预后价值，需要开发更准确的预测模型

Method: 采用回顾性研究设计，分析39名患者69个脑转移癌的病例，提取影像组学和放射组学特征，计算delta特征描述相对变化，使用Lasso算法进行特征选择，构建支持向量回归模型，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 多组学模型表现优于单组学模型，delta影像组学特征显著提升预测准确性，最佳模型达到R2=0.743和RRMSE=0.022

Conclusion: 该多组学SVR模型在预测GTV连续变化方面表现突出，为PULSAR治疗提供了更量化和个性化的病人选择和治疗调整帮助

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Motivation: 传统EEG睡眠监测设备笨重不便，限制了在家庭环境等真实场景中的应用。耳内EEG设备可以提供无创、舒适的长期睡眠监测方案

Method: 使用11名参与者进行睡眠研究，采用带有干耳尖电极的定制耳塞，在一只耳朵中放置测量电极，另一只耳朵放置参考电极。使用Apple Watch Ultra获取真实睡眠阶段标签

Result: 系统在留一法交叉验证中实现了90.5%的二元睡眠检测准确率（清醒vs睡眠）和65.1%的四分类准确率（清醒、REM、核心睡眠、深度睡眠）

Conclusion: 耳内电极作为一种低负担、舒适的睡眠监测方法具有巨大潜力，可用于如用户入睡时自动暂停播客等消费级应用

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Motivation: 现有算法在在线凸凹优化中无法在平稳或可预测环境中提供最优性能，特别是在处理动态对偶间隙(D-DGap)这一关键性能指标时存在不足。

Method: 设计了三模块算法：自适应模块动态调整非平稳性水平，多预测器聚合器选择最佳预测器，集成模块有效结合各组件优势。

Result: 算法实现了近乎最优的D-DGap上界（最多相差对数因子），同时确保预测误差驱动的D-DGap边界，实证结果验证了方法的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该模块化算法为在线凸凹优化提供了有效的解决方案，其设计允许灵活替换组件以适应动态环境，并可整合来自多个预测器的辅助知识。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version

Conclusion: 逆问题方法可以高效地揭示缩放定律，为构建大语言模型提供经济有效的指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

TL;DR: ScaleZero通过混合专家架构和动态参数缩放策略，解决了异构多任务学习中梯度冲突和模型可塑性损失问题，在多个基准测试中达到与专用单任务模型相当的性能，且只需80%的环境交互步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务世界模型（如UniZero）在处理大规模异构环境时面临梯度冲突和模型可塑性损失的问题，限制了其样本和计算效率。

Method: 1. 采用混合专家（MoE）架构缓解梯度冲突，提出ScaleZero模型；2. 引入基于LoRA的动态参数缩放（DPS）策略，根据任务进度动态调整计算负载。

Result: 在Atari、DMControl和Jericho等基准测试中，ScaleZero仅使用在线强化学习和单一模型就达到了与专用单任务基线相当的性能，配合DPS策略后只需80%的环境交互步骤。

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了在大规模多任务学习中有效解决梯度冲突和可塑性问题的潜力，为异构多任务学习提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

Method: 提出联邦学习与多模态多任务基础模型的集成方案，支持多模态和多任务的协作、隐私保护训练

Result: 识别了该方法在隐私保护、个性化和公平包容性三个关键架构架上的潜力，以及实际部署面临的五大研究挑战

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs是一种有前景但尚未充分探索的方法，需要集体解决异构隐私规定、数据模态特征不均等挑战才能实现实际部署

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但完全伪相关会导致模型泛化根本性的欠规范问题

Method: 使用自训练方法学习一组与训练数据一致但在新未标注数据上做出不同预测的概念，通过鼓励自信和选择性分歧来实现

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法，同时保持对不完全伪相关的鲁棒性，在语言模型对齐应用中也表现良好

Conclusion: ACE在克服模型欠规范方面取得重要进展，虽然仍有局限性，但提供了更可配置的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影会导致高维输入的信息损失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏置。

Method: 提出了基于计算高效的结构化矩阵（Block Tensor-Train和Multi-Level Low Rank矩阵）的新评分函数，这些矩阵具有高秩特性。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，提出的评分函数在任何固定计算预算下都优于标准注意力；在语言建模任务中，MLR-based注意力方法相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的缩放规律；在长程时间序列预测中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于一个更广泛的能够编码全秩或距离依赖性计算偏置的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的重要缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Result: 学习率预热一致加速梯度下降，在某些特定情况下比非递增学习率调度快Θ(T)倍收敛

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在优化理论角度具有明确优势，为大规模深度神经网络训练提供了理论支持

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服在意见形成模型中具有重要作用，本文为发送者提供了在不同目标下的信息揭示策略和计算复杂性分析。

Abstract: Prominent opinion formation models such as the one by Friedkin and Johnsen
(FJ) concentrate on the effects of peer pressure on public opinions. In
practice, opinion formation is also based on information about the state of the
world and persuasion efforts. In this paper, we analyze an approach of Bayesian
persuasion in the FJ model. There is an unknown state of the world that
influences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal
information about the state to all agents. The agents update their
preconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose
algorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various
aspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we
show that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class
of range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We
provide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of
preconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a
polynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S. This
generalizes, e.g., instances with a constant number of states and/or agents, or
instances with a logarithmic number of ranges. In general, we show that
subadditive range-based objectives allow a simple n-approximation, and even for
additive ones, obtaining an $n^{1-c}$-approximation is NP-hard, for any
constant $c > 0$.

Conclusion: 为解决公民大会抽样中的实际问题提供了实用的算法解决方案，平衡了城市数量最小化和其他公平性目标

Abstract: In citizens' assemblies, a group of constituents is randomly selected to
weigh in on policy issues. We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by
practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact
information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only
select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring
equal selection probability for constituents ex ante.
  We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the
number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for
a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go
beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more
interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post
monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we
explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical
algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear
programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent
distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to
deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.

Motivation: 理解智能体的公平性在社会互动中至关重要，但缺乏直接观察偏好的方法，因此需要开发能够从演示中推断公平性偏好的技术。

Method: 采用多智能体逆强化学习框架，构建反映智能体对他人福利重视程度的奖励函数，引入贝叶斯策略来分析演示的最优性和一般和马尔可夫博弈中的均衡特征。

Result: 在随机环境和协作烹饪任务中的实验表明，可以从演示中可靠地推断出一致的公平性概念，并且通过分离公平性组件可以获得对智能体偏好的解耦理解。

Conclusion: 通过将智能体置于不同群体中，可以揭示其奖励结构的新方面，从而解决公平性判断的模糊性问题，准确回答"谁在表现公平"这一核心问题。

Abstract: From altruism to antagonism, fairness plays a central role in social
interactions. But can we truly understand how fair someone is, especially
without explicit knowledge of their preferences? We cast this challenge as a
multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning problem, explicitly structuring
rewards to reflect how agents value the welfare of others. We introduce novel
Bayesian strategies, reasoning about the optimality of demonstrations and
characterisation of equilibria in general-sum Markov games. Our experiments,
spanning randomised environments and a collaborative cooking task, reveal that
coherent notions of fairness can be reliably inferred from demonstrations.
Furthermore, when isolating fairness components, we obtain a disentangled
understanding of agents preferences. Crucially, we unveil that by placing
agents in different groups, we can force them to exhibit new facets of their
reward structures, cutting through ambiguity to answer the central question:
who is being fair?

Method: SFF 基于历史广告活动数据动态更新系统参数（如开始时间和节流率），构建在行业标准快速完成功能之上。

Result: 在线预算分割实验数据和离线模拟显示，SFF 在预算节奏控制中是一个稳健的超支缓解解决方案，目前已在 DoorDash 平台实际部署使用。

Conclusion: SFF 通过动态参数调整有效解决了预算节奏控制中的超支问题，为大型交付平台的广告投放系统提供了可靠的预算管理方案。

Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds
upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems
that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the
end of some fixed time period. SFF dynamically updates system parameters such
as start time and throttle rate depending on historical ad-campaign data. SFF
is currently in use at DoorDash, one of the largest delivery platforms in the
US, and is part of its budget pacing system. We show via online budget-split
experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for
overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.

### [111] [Avoiding Over-Personalization with Rule-Guided Knowledge Graph Adaptation for LLM Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07133)
*Fernando Spadea,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 轻量级神经符号框架，通过在推理时适应性修改用户知识图来渗透LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，在保持相关性的同时提高内容新颖度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM基于推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，这会引发个性化信息环境(PIEs)形成过滤氛氛，限制内容多样性。传统方法需要重新训练模型或依赖不透明的调试策略。

Method: 使用符号适应策略（软重新权重、硬反转、偏见三元组目标删除）来重构用户个性化知识图(PKG)，压制特征共现模式。通过客户端学习算法优化适应策略应用，并使用修改后的PKG构建结构化提示来导向语言模型。

Result: 在菜谱推荐基准测试中，个性化PKG适应显著提高了内容新颖性，同时保持了推荐质量，表现超过全局适应和简单提示方法。

Conclusion: 该轻量级神经符号框架能够有效减缓LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，通过符号方法修改用户知识图来实现更多样化的推荐，为解决算法过滤氛问题提供了一种高效的方案。

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard
inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning
algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe
recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly
increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality,
outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.

### [112] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 是一种新颖的检索方法，通过直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档来绕过传统检索-重排序管道的限制，在有限的重排序预算下显著提升检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-重排序管道面临两个关键限制：受限于初始检索质量，以及LLM重排序器计算需求增长限制了可处理文档数量。

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性策略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，且重排序预算限制在100个文档内。

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序模型对下，策略性地选择要重排序的文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

### [113] [Benchmarking Information Retrieval Models on Complex Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07253)
*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个多样化的复杂检索任务集合，用于评测现有检索模型在复杂查询下的性能，发现即使最好的模型也仅能达到中等水平，而LLM查询重写技术对强模型效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型(LLMs)在文本任务上发挥了极大作用，但检索模型还缺乏能够处理复杂查询的通用模型。现有评测集主要测试简单查询，而实际中用户需要检索系统能处理包含多个约束和要求的复杂自然语言查询。

Method: 构建了一个多样化且实际的复杂检索任务集合，对代表性的现有最优检索模型进行基准测试，并探索LLM基于查询扩展和重写技术对检索质量的影响。

Result: 即使最好的模型也在复杂检索任务上表现差强，平均nDCG@10仅为0.346，R@100仅为0.587。LLM增强技术虽然对弱模型有帮助，但对最强模型的性能在所有指标上都有所下降。

Conclusion: 现有检索模型在处理复杂查询时面临显著挑战，需要发展新一代检索模型来满足越来越复杂的信息需求。这个新的评测集为评估和推动检索模型技术的进步提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

*Amelia Kovacs,Jerry Chee,Kimia Kazemian,Sarah Dean*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个包含敏感度标签的新数据集，用于评估个性化AI系统对用户福祉的影响，而不仅仅是参与度指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化AI系统（如推荐系统和聊天机器人）可能向用户暴露敏感或有害内容，影响用户福祉，需要定量评估工具

Method: 创建了两个数据集：1）整合MovieLens评分数据和Does the Dog Die?网站内容警告；2）结合Archive of Our Own的同人小说互动数据和用户生成警告

Result: 开发了包含敏感度分类标签和用户-内容评分的新型数据集

Conclusion: 这些数据集使研究人员能够超越传统参与度指标，定量评估个性化系统对用户福祉的影响

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

TL;DR: MEGG是一个基于经验回放的增量学习框架，通过GGscore指标选择高影响力样本进行回放，有效缓解推荐系统中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经协同过滤模型通常在静态设置下训练，无法适应动态环境中用户偏好的变化。现有增量学习方法在推荐任务中面临数据稀疏性和任务范式差异的挑战。

Method: 提出MEGG框架，引入GGscore指标量化样本影响力，选择性回放高影响力样本。该方法是模型无关的，可无缝集成到各种架构中。

Result: 在三个神经模型和四个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGG在性能、可扩展性、效率和鲁棒性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MEGG为解决推荐系统中的增量学习问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

*Jeongwoo Na,Jun Kwon,Eunseong Choi,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MVP是一种基于非生成式大语言模型的段落重排序方法，通过多视图嵌入和正交损失来提升效率并减少外部偏差影响，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM重排序方法存在计算效率低和对位置/选择偏差敏感的问题，需要一种更高效且抗偏差的重排序解决方案。

Method: 提出MVP模型，使用多视图嵌入将查询-段落信息编码为不同视图的锚向量，通过正交损失增强视图区分度，单步解码计算相关性分数。

Result: 220M参数的MVP模型性能媲美7B规模模型，推理延迟降低100倍；3B参数版本在域内和域外基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MVP通过创新的多视图架构有效解决了LLM重排序的效率和外偏差问题，为高效段落重排序提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based
methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.
(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window
strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the
number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or
selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and
increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking
(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes
query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced
by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings
to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute
relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an
orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of
much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in
inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Zheng Dou,Deqing Wang,Fuzhen Zhuang,Jian Ren,Yanlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FLeW是一个统一的科学文档表示学习方法，通过结合引用意图和频率的三元组采样、基于科学写作结构的领域泛化切面划分，以及自适应权重搜索，解决了现有方法在引用信息利用、细粒度表示和任务感知方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学文档表示学习方法面临三个主要挑战：1)对比学习方法未能充分利用引用信息且只能生成单向量表示；2)细粒度表示方法需要昂贵整合且缺乏领域泛化能力；3)任务感知方法依赖人工预定义任务分类，忽略了细微任务差异。

Method: 提出FLeW方法：1)利用引用意图(背景、方法、结果)和频率的新型三元组采样方法增强引用结构信号；2)基于科学写作通用结构的领域泛化切面划分进行细粒度表示学习；3)采用简单权重搜索自适应整合三个切面级嵌入，无需任务感知微调即可生成任务特定文档嵌入。

Result: 实验表明FLeW在多个科学任务和领域中相比先前模型具有更好的适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLeW成功统一了三种方法，通过引用意图驱动的切面划分和自适应权重整合，实现了更好的科学文档表示学习，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

TL;DR: ELEC是一个高效的LLM增强CTR预测框架，通过结合传统协同模型和LLM的优势，在保持效率的同时提升点击率预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTR预测模型能捕捉表格数据的协同信号但丢失文本语义，LLM擅长理解文本但难以捕捉协同信号且推理延迟长，需要结合两者优势

Method: 使用伪孪生网络（包含增益网络和普通网络），将LLM生成的高层表示向量注入协同CTR模型形成增益网络，然后通过分数级和表示级知识蒸馏将知识迁移到仅使用表格数据的普通网络

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验证明了ELEC在CTR预测中的有效性和效率

Conclusion: ELEC框架成功实现了协同建模和语义建模的优势结合，在保持高效率的同时提升了CTR预测性能，且具有模型无关性

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online
advertising systems. On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture
the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but
they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)
excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face
challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference
latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models
and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is
an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for
the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but
simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which
contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level
representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to
form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling
and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency.
We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on
both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla
network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable
performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for
the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ELEC for CTR prediction.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, despite their growing
popularity for enhancing model response reliability, often struggle with
trustworthiness and explainability. In this work, we present a novel, holistic,

techniques to explain the retrieval and generation processes in a RAG system.
We propose different strategies to evaluate these explanations and discuss the
sufficiency of model-agnostic explanations in RAG systems. With this work, we
further aim to catalyze a collaborative effort to build reliable and

Abstract: The proliferation of long-form documents presents a fundamental challenge to
information retrieval (IR), as their length, dispersed evidence, and complex
structures demand specialized methods beyond standard passage-level techniques.
This survey provides the first comprehensive treatment of long-document
retrieval (LDR), consolidating methods, challenges, and applications across
three major eras. We systematize the evolution from classical lexical and early
neural models to modern pre-trained (PLM) and large language models (LLMs),
covering key paradigms like passage aggregation, hierarchical encoding,
efficient attention, and the latest LLM-driven re-ranking and retrieval
techniques. Beyond the models, we review domain-specific applications,
specialized evaluation resources, and outline critical open challenges such as
efficiency trade-offs, multimodal alignment, and faithfulness. This survey aims
to provide both a consolidated reference and a forward-looking agenda for
advancing long-document retrieval in the era of foundation models.

Conclusion: 提出了质量控制、成本感知调用、领域适应等未来研究方向，为实际约束下的查询扩展技术选择提供了原则性蓝图。

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) must bridge short, ambiguous queries and
ever more diverse, rapidly evolving corpora. Query Expansion (QE) remains a key
mechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted
markedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models
(LLMs). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a
four-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection
(explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases,
model-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to
knowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only, instruction-tuned, and
domain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for
QE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot
reasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE
helps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion
with PLM/LLM-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications
across web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational
and code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design
grounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG
constraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude
with an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal
adaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy.
Collectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and
combining QE techniques under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Effectively managing intellectual property is a significant challenge.
Traditional methods for patent analysis depend on labor-intensive manual
searches and rigid keyword matching. These approaches are often inefficient and
struggle to reveal the complex relationships hidden within large patent
datasets, hindering strategic decision-making. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce KLIPA, a novel framework that leverages a knowledge graph and a
large language model (LLM) to significantly advance patent analysis. Our
approach integrates three key components: a structured knowledge graph to map
explicit relationships between patents, a retrieval-augmented generation(RAG)
system to uncover contextual connections, and an intelligent agent that
dynamically determines the optimal strategy for resolving user queries. We
validated KLIPA on a comprehensive, real-world patent database, where it
demonstrated substantial improvements in knowledge extraction, discovery of
novel connections, and overall operational efficiency. This combination of
technologies enhances retrieval accuracy, reduces reliance on domain experts,
and provides a scalable, automated solution for any organization managing
intellectual property, including technology corporations and legal firms,
allowing them to better navigate the complexities of strategic innovation and
competitive intelligence.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对PAC码的增强型堆栈解码算法，通过利用特殊比特节点（如rate-0和rate-1节点）显著提高并行化程度，并引入剪枝技术减少活跃路径数量，在不降低纠错性能的情况下平均路径数减少70%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAC码在短码长下具有接近容量的性能，但传统堆栈解码需要探索所有路径或限制候选路径数量，计算复杂度和延迟较高。

Method: 提出剪枝技术丢弃错误路径，保留路径度量接近期望均值的路径；开发方差极化近似方法估计BI-AWGN信道下的方差极化；设计选择性保留解码路径的高效堆栈剪枝策略。

Result: 对于PAC(128,64)码，该方法实现了平均路径数减少70%，同时保持纠错性能不下降。

Conclusion: 所提出的增强堆栈解码算法通过智能剪枝策略显著降低了PAC码解码的计算复杂度和延迟，为高效解码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes have recently emerged as a
promising class of error-correcting codes, achieving near-capacity performance
particularly in the short block-length regime. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced stack decoding algorithm for PAC codes that significantly improves
parallelization by exploiting specialized bit nodes, such as rate-0 and rate-1
nodes. For a rate-1 node with $N_0$ leaf nodes in its corresponding subtree,
conventional stack decoding must either explore all $2^{N_0}$ paths, or, same
as in fast list decoding, restrict attention to a constant number of candidate
paths. In contrast, our approach introduces a pruning technique that discards
wrong paths with a probability exponentially approaching zero, retaining only
those whose path metrics remain close to their expected mean values.
Furthermore, we propose a novel approximation method for estimating variance
polarization under the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN)
channel. Leveraging these approximations, we develop an efficient stack-pruning
strategy that selectively preserves decoding paths whose bit-metric values
align with their expected means. This targeted pruning substantially reduces
the number of active paths in the stack, thereby decreasing both decoding
latency and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that for a
PAC(128,64) code, our method achieves up to a 70% reduction in the average
number of paths without degrading error-correction performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive derivation of single and multi-frequency
large-scale path loss model parameters for the close-in (CI) free space
reference distance, CI free space reference distance with cross-polarization
(CIX), floating-intercept (FI), CI free space reference distance with
frequency-dependent path loss exponent (CIF), CI free space reference distance
with frequency-dependent path loss exponent and cross-polarization (CIFX),

models for specific frequencies and across frequency ranges of 7-24 GHz,
0.5-100 GHz, and 0.5-150 GHz. The analysis is based on extensive real-world
measurements conducted by NYU WIRELESS at 6.75 GHz, 16.95 GHz, 28 GHz, 73 GHz,

(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel conditions. Specifically, the
derived CI, FI, and ABG path loss model parameters for 7-24 GHz and 0.5-100 GHz
frequency ranges in this article were submitted in Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) to validate Technical Report (TR) 38.901 InH path loss models,
as part of the release (Rel) 19 study on "Channel Model Validation of TR 38.901

into understanding large-scale path loss, comparing different path loss models,
and extending the path loss models standardized by 3GPP and ITU for the InH
scenario, which is essential for advancing next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: As a promising 6G enabler beyond conventional bit-level transmission,
semantic communication can considerably reduce required bandwidth resources,
while its combination with multiple access requires further exploration. This
paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD)
semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for
multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust
feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop
a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with
enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise
ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white
Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image
restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage
knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on
interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature
affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a
diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform
initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual
quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory
reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These
results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual
metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image
recovery.

Abstract: A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) free-space optical (FSO)
communication system is considered in this paper, which supports the secret key
transmission between two legitimate users, Alice and Bob, by employing
continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). The wireless channels
are subjected to the effects of atmospheric turbulence that lead to beam
spreading, pointing error, and turbulence-induced fading, which, along with the
presence of hybrid quantum noise, negatively impact the secret key exchange
between Alice and Bob. Furthermore, the security of the communication system is
considered to be compromised due to the intervention of an eavesdropper, Eve,
employing a collective Gaussian attack to intercept the secret key exchange.
For this system, novel one-way and two-way protocols are proposed to enhance
the security of the transmitted keys. The transmissivity of the FSO channels is
mathematically formulated, and the bounds on the mutual information between the
transmitted and received coherent states are obtained, using which, novel
expressions for the secret key rates (SKRs) for the one-way and two-way
protocols are derived. Asymptotic expressions for the SKRs and numerical
results corroborating the analytical framework are also presented, which
demonstrate the SKR gains obtained by employing MIMO and the two-way protocol
for the FSO CV-QKD system.

Abstract: This letter investigates a novel wireless-powered quantum optical
communication system, in which a batteryless quantum transmitter harvests
energy from a classical radio-frequency source to transmit quantum coherent
states. The transmission employs M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation
over an optical channel impaired by thermal noise, and the fundamental
detection performance is evaluated using the Helstrom bound. An optimization
framework is proposed that jointly determines the optimal quantum measurement
and the energy-harvesting time fraction to maximize the effective rate under a
block time constraint. Analytical expressions are derived for special cases,
while semidefinite programming techniques are employed for the general M-PSK
scenario. Numerical results validate the unimodal nature of the effective rate
function and demonstrate the impact of the optimal design parameters.

Abstract: We initiate the study of what we term ``fast good codes'' with ``fast good
duals.'' Specifically, we consider the task of constructing a binary linear
code $C \leq \mathcal{F}_2^n$ such that both it and its dual $C^\perp :=\{x \in
\mathcal{F}_2^n:\forall c \in C, \langle x,c\rangle=0\}$ are asymptotically
good (in fact, have rate-distance tradeoff approaching the GV bound), and are
encodable in $O(n)$ time. While we believe such codes should find applications
more broadly, as motivation we describe how such codes can be used the secure
computation task of encrypted matrix-vector product, as studied by Behhamouda
et al (CCS 2025, to appear).
  Our main contribution is a construction of such a fast good code with fast
good dual. Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA)
codes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2
code, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps --
where first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the
prefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative
steps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and
afterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these
two operations are inverse of each other. In particular, the dual of the code
is very similar, with the accumulation and discrete derivative steps reversed.
  Our analysis is inspired by a prior analysis of RMA codes due to Ravazzi and
Fagnani (IEEE Trans. Info. Theory, 2009). The main idea is to bound the
input-output weight-enumerator function: the expected number of messages of a
given weight that are encoded into a codeword of a given weight. We face new
challenges in controlling the behaviour of the discrete derivative matrix
(which can significantly drop the weight of a vector), which we overcome by
careful case analysis.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-static position estimation in cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (CF mMIMO) architectures, where orthogonal time
frequency space (OTFS) is used as an integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC) signal. A maximum likelihood position estimation scheme is proposed,
where the required search space is reduced by employing a common reference
system. Closed-form expressions for the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and the
position error bound (PEB) in multi-static position estimation are derived,
providing quantitative evaluations of sensing performance. These theoretical
bounds are further generalized into a universal structure to support other ISAC
signals. To enhance overall system performance and adapt to dynamic network
requirements, a joint AP operation mode selection and power allocation
algorithm is developed to maximize the minimum user communication spectral
efficiency (SE) while ensuring a specified sensing PEB requirement. Moreover, a
decomposition method is introduced to achieve a better tradeoff between
complexity and ISAC performance. The results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms, demonstrating the superiority of the OTFS signal through a
nearly twofold SE gain over the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) signal. These findings highlight promising advantages of the CF-ISAC
systems from a novel parameter estimation perspective, particularly in
high-mobility vehicle-to-everything applications.

Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) are capable of receiving multi-band
radio-frequency (RF) signals simultaneously, which are expected to break Chu's
limit for classical electronic antennas. However, signals from different users
will interfere with each other in the optical intermediate frequency (IF)
domain of the multi-band quantum receiver, which is termed the IF interference
(IFI) problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum receiver (RAQ-MIMO)
by exploiting the additional spatial diversity of MIMO receivers. Specifically,
by applying the dynamic signal model of RAQRs, we clarify the physical
relationship between the quantum local oscillator (LO) configurations and the
multi-band gains with the concept of quantum transconductance. Then, with the
quantum transconductance-based signal model, we formulate the spectral
efficiency (SE) maximization problem and further propose the quantum weighted
minimum mean square error (qWMMSE) algorithm, which jointly optimizes the
quantum LO configurations and the classical precoder/combiner matrices.
Furthermore, we test the qWMMSE algorithm within the standard space division
multiple access (SDMA) scheme and the frequency division multiple access (FDMA)
scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the qWMMSE optimization framework
can significantly improve the SE of RAQ-MIMO systems for both multiple access
schemes, and that RAQ-MIMO systems can outperform classical electronic
receiver-based multi-user MIMO systems by eliminating the mutual coupling
effect between classical antennas.
