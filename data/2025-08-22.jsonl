Second, a Large Language Model\n(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance\nmetrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight\nrepresentative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,\nBrock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer\nvision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent\npipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,\ncohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building\non this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model\nselection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward\nindividualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening."}

Our key finding challenges the \"test-time scaling\" paradigm: while\nrecent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,\nincreasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves\ncalibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens\nwith longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond\nmodest computational investments.

In this work, we introduce Few-Shot\nAdversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages\nthe in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\ngenerate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that\nrely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,\nFSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,\nrequiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning\nthe LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP\nsynthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly\nembed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic\ncontent. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful\nexamples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which\nenables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across\nunrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health\nMisinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that\nFSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate\ndocuments.

Experimental results\nshow that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning\nthree orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled\nLightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More\nimportantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online\nservice, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average\ninference time acceptable.

The layer-freezing technique\nhas recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively\nreduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing\nmethods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate\nfeature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.\nTo overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches\nfeature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to\ntrain directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be\nstraightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely\noverlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations\nto feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these\noverlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method\nwill be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first\nto comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.\nTo improve training accuracy, we propose \\textit{similarity-aware channel\naugmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a\nminimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate\nlossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \\textit{progressive\ncompression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are\nfrozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves\nsignificant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with\na minor time overhead.

RoPE, a recent SBI\napproach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process\nthat combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based\ndistribution alignment.

Designed with research and practical applications in mind,\nAgentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In\nthis framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used\ninternally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics\nencourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting\nprompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by\nLLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when\ntypes are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the\napplicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question\nanswering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization\ntasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without\nsacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at\n\\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}."}

While prior\nwork typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward\nsignals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent\ncontributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted\nthat are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing\nthe policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents\ntend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the\nlikelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a\nmethod based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each\nagent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.\nSpecifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies\nby assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis\nacross cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to\nwhich agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects\nbetween policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent\nbehaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic\ndecisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed\nmethod offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances\nexplainability in MARL systems."}

Traditional approaches treat these\ndimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated\nmethods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about\noptimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability."}
