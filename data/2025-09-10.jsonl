The classical\n$\\mathsf{CountSketch}$ algorithm due to Charikar, Chen, and Farach-Colton\n[2004], was the first algorithm to detect $\\ell_2$ heavy hitters using\n$O\\left(\\frac{\\log^2 n}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ bits of space, and their algorithm is\noptimal for streams with deletions. For insertion-only streams, Braverman,\nChestnut, Ivkin, Nelson, Wang, and Woodruff [2017] gave the $\\mathsf{BPTree}$\nalgorithm which requires only $O\\left(\\frac{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}{\\epsilon}\\log n\n\\right)$ space. Note that any algorithm requires at least\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\log n\\right)$ space to output $O(1/\\epsilon)$ heavy\nhitters in the worst case. So for constant $\\epsilon$, the space usage of the\n$\\mathsf{BPTree}$ algorithm is optimal but their bound could be sub-optimal for\n$\\epsilon=o(1)$. In this work, we show that for random order streams, where the\nstream elements can be adversarial but their order of arrival is uniformly\nrandom, it is possible to achieve the optimal space bound of\n$O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\log n\\right)$ for every $\\epsilon =\n\\Omega\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{\\sqrt{\\log n}}}\\right)$. We also show that for\npartially random order streams where only the heavy hitters are required to be\nuniformly distributed in the stream, it is possible to achieve the same space\nbound, but with an additional assumption that the algorithm is given a constant\napproximation to $F_2$ in advance."}

Leveraging these approximations, we develop an efficient stack-pruning\nstrategy that selectively preserves decoding paths whose bit-metric values\nalign with their expected means. This targeted pruning substantially reduces\nthe number of active paths in the stack, thereby decreasing both decoding\nlatency and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate that for a\nPAC(128,64) code, our method achieves up to a 70% reduction in the average\nnumber of paths without degrading error-correction performance."}

In this paper,\nwe characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the\nsymbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the\nunderlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms\ninstead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification\nto leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic\nmodeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \\textit{DeepProbLog},\n\\textit{Scallop}, and \\textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within\neach facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each\nframework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim\nto spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this\nproblem in novel ways."}

The proposed approach\nfacilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through\na composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional\nsub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework\ncomprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate\nmodels for all random variables, identifying the requirements for\ncoupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable\nsub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design\nof experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,\nwith objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample\nlocation and inter-sample distances.

Our construction is inspired by the repeat multiple accumulate (RMA)\ncodes of Divsalar, Jin and McEliece (Allerton, 1998). To create the rate 1/2\ncode, after repeating each message coordinate, we perform accumulation steps --\nwhere first a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and afterwards the\nprefix-sum mod 2 is applied -- which are alternated with discrete derivative\nsteps -- where again a uniform coordinate permutation is applied, and\nafterwards the previous two coordinates are summed mod 2. Importantly, these\ntwo operations are inverse of each other.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers.

This is often accompanied by catastrophic\nforgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods\nhave been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been\nsurprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR\nobjectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those\nforgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge\nretention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the\npolicy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from\nits diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:\nusing the divergence term itself as the solution.

By\ncontinuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to\nmaintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain.

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable\nguidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into\nclassifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques."}

We argue that standard RLVR\nobjectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those\nforgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge\nretention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the\npolicy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from\nits diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:\nusing the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,\nDiversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences\n(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By\ncontinuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to\nmaintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL\ngeneration demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but\nimproves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is\nmore training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator\nfunctions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online\nreference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving\nRLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a\npowerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models."}

While numerous studies have explored\nrebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to\nevaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such\ntechniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the\nperformance of binary classifiers \"as-is\", without performing any explicit\nrebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a\ndiverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic\ndatasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and\nfew-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data\ncomplexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate\nreal-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include\nexperiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class\nclassification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.\nThe results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data\ncomplexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional\nclassifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN\nand boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better\ngeneralization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and\nevaluation metrics further validate these findings.

GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code\nsimilarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen\nreal-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and\ninterpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious\ncorrelations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.\nCounterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite\nlabels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a\nLarge Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples\nwith opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the\ncrucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring\nspurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more\nrobust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to\n97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group\naccuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20\nvulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class\nattribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score\ndependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real\nand counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION\nadvances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through\ninteractive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis."}

A program that produces the counts of different queries often risks\nleaking sensitive individual-level information. A popular approach to enhance\ndata privacy is to return a noisy version of the actual count. It is typically\nachieved by adding independent noise to each query and then control the total\nprivacy budget within a period. This approach may be limited in the number of\nqueries and output accuracy in practice. Also, the returned counts do not\nmaintain the total order for nested queries, an important feature in many\napplications. This work presents the design and analysis of a new method,\nsigma-counting, that addresses these challenges.
