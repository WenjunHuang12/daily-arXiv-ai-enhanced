### [1] [List Recoverable Codes: The Good, the Bad, and the Unknown (hopefully not Ugly)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07597)
*Nicolas Resch,S. Venkitesh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文综述了列表恢复码的最新研究成果，包括可能性结果、不可能性结果和未知问题，并展示了列表恢复码在理论计算机科学中的多种应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 列表恢复是纠错码的基本任务，它从最坏情况错误和列表解码中大大推广了唯一解码。该问题在编码理论和理论计算机科学中以多种形式出现。

Method: 通过调查分析近期关于列表恢复码的研究成果，包括存在性证明、不可能性证明以及尚未解决的问题。

Result: 展示了列表恢复码不仅作为列表解码级联码的组成部分，还在理论计算机科学的其他领域中找到了多种应用和联系。

Conclusion: 列表恢复码是一个基础且重要的研究领域，在编码理论和理论计算机科学中具有广泛的应用前景和研究价值。

Abstract: List recovery is a fundamental task for error-correcting codes, vastly
generalizing unique decoding from worst-case errors and list decoding. Briefly,
one is given ''soft information'' in the form of input lists S_1,...,S_n of
bounded size, and one argues that there are not too many codewords that agree a
lot with this soft information. This general problem appears in many guises,
both within coding theory and in theoretical computer science more broadly.
  In this article we survey recent results on list recovery codes, introducing
both the ''good'' (i.e., possibility results, showing that codes with certain
list recoverability exist), the ''bad'' (impossibility results), and the
''unknown''. We additionally demonstrate that, while list recoverable codes
were initially introduced as a component in list decoding concatenated codes,
they have since found myriad applications to and connections with other topics
in theoretical computer science.

### [2] [Is star complexity a proxy for information based complexity of graphs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07722)
*Russell K. Standish*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了信息基础复杂度(IBC)在图形复杂度测量中的应用，比较了基于链接的IBC测量C和星形复杂度C*，发现它们之间存在强相关性，并找到了星形复杂度的易计算上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同实用IBC测量方法之间的渐近等价性，特别关注图形复杂度测量，验证Standish提出的基于链接的IBC测量与星形复杂度之间的关系。

Method: 构建了10和22个顶点的图形，星形复杂度达到8，经验性地比较了C*和C测量方法，并找到了星形复杂度的易计算上界。

Result: 经验分析显示C*和C之间存在强相关性，找到了与C强相关的星形复杂度上界。

Conclusion: 不同实用的IBC测量方法在渐近意义下是等价的，星形复杂度与基于链接的IBC测量存在强相关性，为图形复杂度分析提供了新的工具。

Abstract: Information-based complexity (IBC) is a well-defined complexity measure of
any object given a description in a language and a classifier that identifies
those descriptions with the object. Of course, the exact numerical value will
vary according to the descriptive language and classifier, but under certain
universality conditions (eg the classifier identifies programs of a universal
Turning machine that halt and output the same value), asymptotically, the
complexity measure is independent of the classifier up to a constant of O(1).
The hypothesis being investigated in this work that any practical IBC measure
will similarly be asymptotically equivalent to any other practical IBC measure.
Standish presented an IBC measure for graphs ${\cal C}$ that encoded graphs by
their links, and identifies graphs as those that are automorphic to each other.
An interesting alternate graph measure is {\em star complexity}, which is
defined as the number of union and intersection operations of basic stars that
can generate the original graph. Whilst not an IBC itself, it can be related to
an IBC (called ${\cal C}^*$) that is strongly correlated with star complexity.
In this paper, 10 and 22 vertex graphs are constructed up to a star complexity
of 8, and the ${\cal C}^*$ compared emprically with ${\cal C}$. Finally, an
easily computable upper bound of star complexity is found to be strongly
related to ${\cal C}$.

### [3] [Integrated Localization, Mapping, and Communication through VCSEL-Based Light-emitting RIS (LeRIS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08071)
*Rashid Iqbal,Dimitrios Bozanis,Dimitrios Tyrovolas,Christos K. Liaskos,Muhammad Ali Imran,George K. Karagiannidis,Hanaa Abumarshoud*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出基于VCSEL的发光可重构智能表面架构，集成用户定位、障碍物感知地图构建和毫米波通信功能，实现紧凑、低功耗且分析可处理的系统设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有LED基LeRIS设计的漫射发射问题以及LiDAR辅助方案需要笨重传感模块的不足，寻求更紧凑、低功耗且分析可处理的集成方案。

Method: 利用VCSEL的窄高斯光束和多模多样性，通过五个VCSEL从接收信号强度联合恢复用户位置和方向，在特定几何条件下可减少到三个VCSEL；同时提出基于反射信号到达时间测量的障碍物检测方法。

Result: 仿真结果显示毫米级定位精度、鲁棒的障碍物检测、高频谱效率以及显著的最小用户速率增益。

Conclusion: VCSEL基LeRIS被确立为具有多功能可编程无线环境的弹性6G无线系统的可扩展且实际可集成的使能器。

Abstract: This paper presents a light-emitting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(LeRIS) architecture that integrates vertical cavity surface emitting lasers
(VCSELs) to jointly support user localization, obstacle-aware mapping, and
millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in programmable wireless environments
(PWEs). Unlike prior light-emitting diode (LED)-based LeRIS designs with
diffuse emission or LiDAR-assisted schemes requiring bulky sensing modules, the
proposed VCSEL-based approach exploits narrow Gaussian beams and multimode
diversity to enable compact, low-power, and analytically tractable integration.
We derive closed-form expressions to jointly recover user position and
orientation from received signal strength using only five VCSELs, and reduce
this requirement to three under specific geometric conditions by leveraging
dual-mode operation. In parallel, we introduce a VCSEL-based mapping method
that uses reflected signal time-of-arrival measurements to detect obstructions
and guide blockage-resilient RIS beam routing. Simulation results demonstrate
millimeter-level localization accuracy, robust obstacle detection, high
spectral efficiency, and substantial gains in minimum user rate. These findings
establish VCSEL-based LeRIS as a scalable and practically integrable enabler
for resilient 6G wireless systems with multi-functional PWEs.

### [4] [Near-optimal Rank Adaptive Inference of High Dimensional Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08117)
*Frédéric Zheng,Yassir Jedra,Alexandre Proutiere*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了高维矩阵估计问题，提出了秩自适应算法，通过数据驱动方式确定有效秩，在估计精度和近似成本之间取得平衡，并开发了接近理论极限的实用算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维矩阵估计中的秩自适应问题，探索如何在样本复杂度、噪声水平和矩阵特性之间找到最优平衡点，以提升矩阵估计的效率和准确性。

Method: 结合最小二乘估计器和通用奇异值阈值处理程序，通过增强的奇异值阈值去噪方法分析，提出秩自适应算法来估计矩阵的奇异值和奇异向量。

Result: 建立了样本复杂度的实例特定下界，提出了性能接近理论极限的算法，并在多元回归和线性动态系统识别等应用中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了秩自适应矩阵估计中的基本权衡关系，提出的算法能够根据数据自适应确定最优有效秩，在理论和实践层面都取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear
measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These
algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the
corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined
based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample
complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting
the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular
values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our
analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being
estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that
combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding
procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and
demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits.
Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on
singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to
multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.

### [5] [Exponential Error Bounds for Information Bottleneck Source Coding Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08364)
*Han Wu,Hamdi Joudeh*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了信息瓶颈源编码问题，分析了在速率高于或低于率失真函数时，超额失真概率收敛到0或1的速度。建立了精确的误差指数和强逆指数，并揭示了IB源编码与带辅助源的源编码之间的码级联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信息瓶颈源编码的超额失真概率收敛速度，特别是在速率高于或低于率失真函数时的指数收敛行为，这对于理解编码性能的极限具有重要意义。

Method: 通过推导匹配的指数上界和下界来建立精确的误差指数和强逆指数，涉及辅助随机变量的优化。同时建立了IB源编码与Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner问题之间的码级联系。

Result: 获得了IB源编码的精确误差指数和强逆指数，这些指数涉及辅助随机变量的优化。还证明了WAK问题的每个码都是IB源编码的码，并重新推导了WAK问题的最佳已知球包装指数。

Conclusion: 本文为信息瓶颈源编码建立了完整的指数理论框架，揭示了其与带辅助源的源编码之间的深刻联系，为理解这些编码问题的性能极限提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We study the information bottleneck (IB) source coding problem, also known as
remote lossy source coding under logarithmic loss. Based on a rate-limited
description of noisy observations, the receiver produces a soft estimate for
the remote source, i.e., a probability distribution, evaluated under the
logarithmic loss. We focus on the excess distortion probability of IB source
coding and investigate how fast it converges to 0 or 1, depending on whether
the rate is above or below the rate-distortion function. The latter case is
also known as the exponential strong converse. We establish both the exact
error exponent and the exact strong converse exponent for IB source coding by
deriving matching upper and lower exponential bounds. The obtained exponents
involve optimizations over auxiliary random variables. The matching converse
bounds are derived through non-trivial extensions of existing sphere packing
and single-letterization techniques, which we adapt to incorporate auxiliary
random variables.
  In the second part of this paper, we establish a code-level connection
between IB source coding and source coding with a helper, also known as the
Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem. We show that every code for the WAK
problem is a code for IB source coding. This requires noticing that IB source
coding, under the excess distortion criterion, is equivalent to source coding
with a helper available at both the transmitter and the receiver; the latter in
turn relates to the WAK problem. Through this connection, we re-derive the best
known sphere packing exponent of the WAK problem, and provide it with an
operational interpretation.

### [6] [A Rate-Distortion Bound for ISAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08487)
*Mohammadreza Bakhshizadeh Mohajer,Alex Dytso,Daniela Tuninetti,Luca Barletta*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了基于率失真理论的逆界（RDB），用于分析集成感知与通信系统的性能极限，克服了传统估计理论如贝叶斯克拉美-罗界的限制条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决集成感知与通信系统性能分析中传统估计理论的局限性，特别是贝叶斯克拉美-罗界对参数分布和失真度量的严格假设限制。

Method: 引入基于率失真理论的新型逆界框架，适用于任意参数分布和失真度量，包括均方误差和错误概率。

Result: 证明该界在高感知噪声区域是紧的，在低感知噪声区域可以严格优于贝叶斯克拉美-罗界，并在Nakagami衰落信道估计和二进制占用检测任务中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为表征集成感知与通信系统的终极性能权衡提供了一个强大而通用的工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental performance limits of Integrated Sensing
and Communication (ISAC) systems by introducing a novel converse bound based on
rate-distortion theory. This rate-distortion bound (RDB) overcomes the
restrictive regularity conditions of classical estimation theory, such as the
Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB). The proposed framework is broadly
applicable, holding for arbitrary parameter distributions and distortion
measures, including mean-squared error and probability of error. The bound is
proved to be tight in the high sensing noise regime and can be strictly tighter
than the BCRB in the low sensing noise regime. The RDB's utility is
demonstrated on two challenging scenarios: Nakagami fading channel estimation,
where it provides a valid bound even when the BCRB is inapplicable, and a
binary occupancy detection task, showcasing its versatility for discrete
sensing problems. This work provides a powerful and general tool for
characterizing the ultimate performance tradeoffs in ISAC systems.

### [7] [Truth-Aware Decoding: A Program-Logic Approach to Factual Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07331)
*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD) 是一种验证导向的解码方案，通过知识库对齐神经语言生成，在解码时使用语义防护机制减少幻觉，同时保持吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经语言模型生成内容与知识库不一致的问题，减少幻觉，同时不牺牲模型吞吐量，为大规模经验模型与形式验证之间搭建实用桥梁。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学，在指令调优系统上添加语义防护格，采用约束语义学、贪心选择证明、熵式不变量和多智能体操作演算等方法。

Result: 数值和算法案例研究表明，防护机制有效减少幻觉而不影响吞吐量，实现了经验模型与形式验证的实用结合。

Conclusion: TAD 提供了一种实用的解码方案，通过形式验证方法确保语言生成与知识库的一致性，为可靠的语言模型应用提供了理论基础和实现保障。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

### [8] [L2M-AID: Autonomous Cyber-Physical Defense by Fusing Semantic Reasoning of Large Language Models with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07363)
*Tianxiang Xu,Zhichao Wen,Xinyu Zhao,Jun Wang,Yan Li,Chang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM赋能的工业物联网自主防御框架，通过多智能体强化学习实现自适应安全防护，在检测率和误报率方面显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业物联网系统面临复杂的多阶段攻击，传统防御缺乏上下文感知能力，需要更智能的自适应安全解决方案。

Method: 结合LLM作为语义桥梁，将非结构化遥测数据转换为上下文感知状态表示，使用多智能体强化学习算法MAPPO学习协作策略，奖励函数平衡安全目标和操作稳定性。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和MITRE ATT&CK ICS合成数据集上，L2M-AID达到97.2%检测率，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为关键国家基础设施安全提供了一个强大的新范式，通过深度融合LLM和MARL实现语义感知的自主防御。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

### [9] [Base Models Know How to Reason, Thinking Models Learn When](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07364)
*Constantin Venhoff,Iván Arcuschin,Philip Torr,Arthur Conmy,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 思考模型如DeepSeek R1的性能提升主要来自更有效地利用基础模型已有的推理能力，而非学习全新能力。通过激活基础模型在合适时间的推理机制，可以恢复思考模型91%的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型性能提升的本质原因：是学习全新推理能力，还是更有效地利用基础模型已有能力。

Method: 提出混合模型方法，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法来发现思考模型中的可解释推理行为。

Result: 在3个基础模型和4个思考模型上，混合模型无需权重更新就能恢复思考模型91%的性能差距，仅需引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在合适时间有效部署这些机制，实现推理计算的高效利用。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right
time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.

### [10] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康评估转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例展示生成式AI如何解决神经心理学能力限制，实现个性化纵向护理路径，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为变革性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断评估存在能力限制，需要更个性化、纵向的护理方法。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的体验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，建立持续更新的心理健康数字孪生模型。

Result: AI能够高效进行患者体验采样，实现动态适应个体需求和病情变化，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Conclusion: 心理健康数字孪生框架有潜力变革个性化心理健康护理，需要进一步研究来完善和操作化这一框架。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

*William Nguyen,Vinh Luong,Christopher Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProSEA是一个模块化多智能体框架，通过探索和计划演化实现迭代问题解决，在FinanceBench基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作和自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，由管理器智能体协调领域专家智能体，基于失败尝试的结构化反馈进行任务分解和自适应重规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空交通预测框架，通过引入结合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性的SpatioSemantic专家，在METR LA和PEMS BAY数据集上显著优于TESTAM，并发现策略性专家选择比简单集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通预测模型如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式结合，限制了其空间建模能力。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入新颖的SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动特征相似性相结合。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%（3.10 vs 3.14），在PEMS BAY上提升4.1%（1.65 vs 1.72）；最佳配置比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%（2.99 vs 3.38），推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 策略性设计的少量专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时具有更优的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLM的推理能力与时间序列分析工具结合，避免知识泄露和幻觉问题，在推理任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在时间序列推理任务中存在幻觉和知识泄露问题，需要一种能充分利用LLM推理能力同时避免这些缺陷的方法。

Method: 设计TS-Agent，让LLM专注于证据收集和结论合成，将统计和结构信息提取委托给时间序列分析工具，通过原子操作符与原始数值序列交互，并使用自我批评和最终质量门进行迭代优化。

Result: 在基准测试中，TS-Agent在理解任务上达到SOTA LLM水平，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型，特别是在零样本设置下。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过分离LLM推理和时间序列分析，有效解决了时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄露问题，实现了可解释和可验证的推理过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

and reliability of the content. To address these challenges, we propose
ExpertAgent - an intelligent agent framework designed for personalized
education that provides reliable knowledge and enables highly adaptive learning
experiences. Therefore, we developed ExpertAgent, an innovative learning agent
that provides users with a proactive and personalized learning experience.
ExpertAgent dynamic planning of the learning content and strategy based on a
continuously updated student model. Therefore, overcoming the limitations of
traditional static learning content to provide optimized teaching strategies
and learning experience in real time. All instructional content is grounded in
a validated curriculum repository, effectively reducing hallucination risks in
large language models and improving reliability and trustworthiness.

### [15] [Evaluation of LLMs for Process Model Analysis and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07489)
*Akhil Kumar,Jianliang Leon Zhao,Om Dobariya*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs（如ChatGPT）能够理解BPMN流程模型图像，通过自然语言界面进行深度推理，发现语法和逻辑错误，并在零样本设置下有效回答关于流程模型的查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在理解业务流程模型、发现错误和进行深度推理方面的能力，探索其作为业务流程设计助手的作用。

Method: 使用多个LLMs（包括ChatGPT o3模型）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，通过自然语言对话进行交互式分析。

Result: 未经训练的LLMs能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，在不同深度层次（语法、逻辑、语义）上智能回答问题，不同LLMs在准确性和有效性方面表现各异。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，表现出拟人化特性，能够进行深度推理分析。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

TL;DR: 本文研究了医疗智能系统的伦理风险降低优化问题，提出了基于MIP、SAT和CP三种求解方法，并使用Minizinc建模进行实验比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案归类为高风险系统，需要正式的风险管理流程来确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，研究混合整数规划、可满足性和约束编程三种求解范式，使用Minizinc约束建模语言进行建模。

Result: 通过实验研究比较了三种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 从方法论的局限性出发，提出了将Minizinc模型整合到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"早期经验"的中间范式，使用智能体自身交互数据作为监督信号，通过隐式世界建模和自我反思两种策略来改进语言智能体的学习和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言智能体主要依赖专家数据进行监督微调，但这种方法难以扩展且泛化能力差，因为专家演示只覆盖有限场景。强化学习在缺乏可验证奖励或需要长序列环境交互时也很困难。

Method: 使用智能体自身交互产生的早期经验数据，采用两种策略：(1)隐式世界建模：利用收集的状态来让策略基于环境动态；(2)自我反思：智能体从次优行动中学习以改进推理和决策。

Result: 在八个多样化环境和多个模型系列中评估，方法持续提高了有效性和跨域泛化能力。在具有可验证奖励的环境中，结果为后续强化学习提供了良好基础。

Conclusion: 早期经验为模仿学习和完全经验驱动智能体之间提供了实用的桥梁，显著提升了智能体的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新的偏好关系获取和评估框架，仅需m-1次两两比较就能获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统两两比较方法需要完成m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负荷高，存在不一致风险，且计算复杂度高。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用精简的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的两两比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。

Result: 该方法确保设计一致性，最小化认知努力，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数，并与经典卡片法兼容。

Conclusion: TTM方法有效解决了传统两两比较方法的局限性，并开发了基于Web的工具展示其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体框架，用于解决流行路径查询问题，通过搜索和生成两阶段流程，在真实和合成数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法需要模型训练、参数调整和重新训练，而大型语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索其在地理空间问题中的应用很有价值。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，分为SEARCH阶段（识别流行路径）和GENERATE阶段（在历史轨迹数据中不存在时合成新路径）的两阶段流程。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验显示，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出卓越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将LLM的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为流行路径查询提供了有效解决方案，展示了LLM在空间问题中的潜力。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告、质量管控不足等问题，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，亟需建立统一可信的评估体系。

Method: 提出PeerBench蓝图，采用社区治理模式，包含密封执行、题库银行与滚动更新、延迟透明度等核心机制。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过插入必要问题来阻止多智能体系统中边缘级错误的传播，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然承诺通过协作分工增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会在整个链中传播），经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从整理的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略；(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问；(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提升公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，作者贡献了边缘级错误的分类学原理和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统难以信任，因为错误会从一个阶段悄悄传递到下一个阶段，需要建立可追踪和可问责的管道系统来识别错误来源并分配责任。

Method: 采用Planner->Executor->Critic管道结构，评估了8种配置的三种最先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制，量化各角色的修复率和损害率。

Result: 1) 添加结构化的可问责交接显著提高准确性；2) 模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；3) 准确性-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖性的，异构管道通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理基准上表现不佳，但研究发现这是由于评估指标的系统性低估导致的，需要更准确的评估方法和提升策略。

Method: 引入组匹配分数来更好地利用组结构，并提出测试时匹配算法——一种无需外部监督的迭代自改进方法。

Result: 新方法显著提升了模型性能：SigLIP-B16超越GPT-4.1，在Winoground上首次超过估计的人类表现，在16个数据集上均获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估方法和测试时优化，可以显著释放AI模型在组合推理任务中的隐藏能力，推动该领域的前沿发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Method: 首先开发Safe OPG方法，基于高置信度离线策略评估；然后提出DEPL框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPL框架能在保证安全的同时有效探索新物品

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时实现新物品的有效探索

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监测的奖励生成方法，通过实时监测系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，生成反映瞬时状态动态的奖励，解决了传统STL-RL方法中全局稀疏奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实时安全关键系统中，传统STL指导的强化学习方法使用全局稀疏奖励，无法准确累积局部变化，导致训练不收敛和不稳定。需要一种能够反映瞬时状态动态的连续奖励生成机制。

Method: 提出在线因果监测方法，在每个控制步骤持续监测系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的量化距离，生成瞬时奖励。同时提供因果语义的平滑近似，使其可微分以适用于深度强化学习方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中的连续控制基准测试上，该方法优于现有的STL指导RL方法，提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 基于STL在线因果语义的强化学习方法能够有效解决稀疏奖励问题，提高训练稳定性和效率，为深度强化学习提供了更好的奖励生成框架。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

TL;DR: 提出了oMeBench基准测试和oMeS评估框架，用于评估大语言模型在有机反应机理推理方面的能力。研究发现当前模型虽显示化学直觉，但在多步推理方面表现不佳，通过提示策略和微调可将性能提升50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有机反应机理是理解化学反应性和设计新分子的基础。虽然大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，如生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步路径。

Method: 引入oMeBench（首个大规模、专家策划的有机机理推理基准），包含10,000多个带注释的机理步骤。提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分。

Result: 分析最先进的大语言模型发现，当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步推理方面存在困难。使用提示策略和在所提数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先的闭源模型提高50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench将为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供严格基础。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合层次化引用图来生成更全面、结构更好的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成综述的方法通常直接提取和总结论文内容，忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合层次化引用图（包含Foundation、Development、Frontier三层），结合横向层内搜索和纵向跨层遍历，通过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明SurveyG在人类专家和LLM-as-a-judge评估中都优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且与领域知识分类体系更匹配。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，显著提升了LLM生成综述的质量，为自动化综述生成提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在医学领域容易产生事实和逻辑错误的问题，因为在这个高风险领域，错误是不可接受的。

Method: 采用递归分解复杂医疗任务为原子步骤，建立可形式化验证的推理链，并引入"引导"模式将已验证的推理链存储为"定理"，后续任务使用RAG进行低成本验证。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域的验证中，MMIA实现了超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，显著优于基线LLM，RAG模式预计可降低85%的处理成本。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要进展，使LLM技术在医学关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GRAIL框架，将测试时图域适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用大语言模型将目标图恢复到类似源域的原始状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域适应方法依赖源域数据，但在隐私和安全限制下源域数据往往不可用，因此需要开发无需源域数据的测试时图域适应方法。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架：1）压缩节点表示为紧凑潜在特征，使用图扩散过程建模图恢复；2）量化模块将恢复特征编码为离散标记；3）微调LLM作为生成式恢复器；4）引入强化学习过程，通过对齐和置信度奖励优化恢复质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将图域适应重新定义为生成式恢复问题，并利用LLM的能力，GRAIL框架成功实现了无需源域数据的测试时图域适应。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分解方法依赖启发式、代理或手动分解，导致LLM在复杂任务上可靠性不足。

Method: 将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式化复杂度度量指导分解。

Result: 在组合优化和数据库查询任务上，基于复杂度度量的分解使代理性能提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: ACONIC框架通过系统化分解方法有效提升LLM在复杂任务上的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

TL;DR: 提出GCPO方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO算法在模型无法解决问题时缺乏正确更新方向的问题，提高训练效率和推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型rollout响应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对样本中获取知识。当模型无法解决问题时，缺乏正确的更新方向。

Method: 引入Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)，在模型无法解决问题时，使用外部标准参考答案提供正确响应，引导模型向明确准确的更新方向优化。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法通过引入外部参考答案，有效解决了GRPO的局限性，提高了训练效率和推理泛化能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出SHADOW框架，通过强化学习在对抗环境中平衡信息获取与风险暴露的权衡，实现更高的追捕成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗环境中存在信息获取与风险暴露的关键权衡：获取信息增强态势感知，但同时可能暴露自身位置增加风险。

Method: 提出SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线实现更高的成功率，消融研究确认时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

<details>

Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架，包含全局交通分配代理和局部导航代理，采用协同推理优化机制和双奖励结构（个体奖励和共享奖励）。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最多160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在旅行效率和拥堵缓解方面优于九种基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our

Conclusion: Augur框架通过利用LLM的因果推理能力，不仅提高了预测准确性，还提供了透明可追溯的变量交互推理，为LLM在时间序列预测中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估深度研究系统提供了全面框架，建立了系统能力比较的基础，支持深度研究向智能研究伙伴的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

Result: 建立了有意义透明度的框架，强调透明度应让公众能够与影响他们生活的AI系统互动

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决AI系统在公共服务中问题的关键，它连接了理解与行动潜力，使公众能够真正参与决策过程

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器四个核心组件，通过反事实扰动迫使代理学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在样本外泛化方面超越所有基线，提供优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效缓解了LLM金融代理的信息泄漏问题，提高了模型在真实市场环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，以增强基于LLM的AI代理的个性化长期交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的AI代理在提供个性化交互方面存在局限，检索增强生成虽然提升了上下文感知，但缺乏结合上下文信息和用户特定数据的机制。

Method: 基于统一的个性化定义，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟的AI代理模式，开发了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore等指标，并通过为期五天的试点用户研究收集了用户对感知个性化的反馈。

Conclusion: 研究为未来工作提供了初步指导，强调了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM代理的适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 提出了TaoSR-SHE框架，通过SRPO算法结合步骤级奖励，解决电商搜索相关性分析中现有方法的泛化性和逻辑一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式（SFT、DPO、RLVR）在长尾查询泛化、细粒度监督和稀疏反馈方面存在局限，需要更可解释和鲁棒的相关性系统。

Method: TaoSR-SHE框架核心是SRPO强化学习算法，结合生成式步骤奖励模型和人工标注验证器，采用多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习。

Result: 在真实搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了电商搜索相关性分析的可解释性和鲁棒性，为复杂推理场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注孤立能力如转录或问答，缺乏对多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估。

Method: 创建包含5,500+合成语音查询的基准，支持英语、印地语等7种印度语言，使用基于说话人嵌入的采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 该基准暴露了当前语音语言模型的关键局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要评估框架。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多智能体框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作来解决移动GUI代理在模糊、动态和冲突任务场景中的信息困境问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过度强调自主操作，忽视了任务执行过程中用户主动参与的必要性，导致在信息困境场景下无法适应真实用户需求和偏好。

Method: ReInAgent框架包含三个专门智能体：信息管理智能体负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策智能体负责冲突感知规划，反思智能体负责任务反思和信息一致性验证，所有智能体围绕共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 实验结果表明ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境问题，产生更符合用户偏好的结果。在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的人机协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，在复杂现实场景中实现了更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管能够高精度重建数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与数值输入空间正交，且随着小数精度的增加性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续表示，以及它们在数值表示中的实际表现。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值嵌入空间中的表现。

Result: 虽然重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，表明许多嵌入空间分量与简单数值输入空间正交，且随着小数精度增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型在数值表示中存在非连续性和噪声问题，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段调整熵值来控制大推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时减少冗余推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型生成的推理过程往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个重要挑战。

Method: 提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚过高的熵值以鼓励简洁推理，在最终答案阶段允许适度的探索性，实现自适应长度控制。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时保持竞争力的准确性，并展现出良好的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制PEAR能有效平衡推理的简洁性和性能，为控制大模型推理长度提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能欠佳和收敛缓慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，而W^V的特征表示相对稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保持任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保留通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专门角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: 通过考虑注意力参数的功能差异，AILoRA为参数高效微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

TL;DR: LinguaSim是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够将自然语言转换为真实、交互式的3D场景，确保动态车辆交互和输入描述与生成场景的忠实对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的场景生成方法难以平衡命令遵循准确性与真实世界驾驶环境的真实性，常常为了降低场景描述复杂度而牺牲真实性，限制在2D或非交互式仿真中。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，通过反馈校准模块进一步细化生成精度，提高对用户意图的保真度，利用场景描述和自动驾驶模型约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的具有不同关键性的场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其细化模块有效降低了初始输出中的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim通过弥合自然语言与闭环交互仿真之间的差距，促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符合性选择方法仅限于单阈值场景，无法满足实际应用中多条件选择（如合取或析取条件）的需求。

Method: MCCS算法引入具有区域单调性的新型非符合性分数用于合取条件，以及全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序用于析取条件。

Result: 实验验证MCCS在多种多条件环境、不同现实世界模态和多任务可扩展性方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MCCS能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线评论质量排序对电商平台至关重要，但质量评估面临领域依赖性和动态变化的挑战。传统方法难以跨领域扩展，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性。

Method: AutoQual模拟人类研究过程，通过反思生成特征假设，自主工具实现特征操作化，并在持久记忆中积累经验，将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性可计算特征。

Result: 在拥有亿级用户的大规模在线平台上部署，A/B测试显示平均每用户查看评论数增加0.79%，评论读者转化率提升0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估的可扩展性和可解释性问题，证明了其作为通用框架将隐性知识转化为显性特征的潜力。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除所有敏感信息及其代理变量来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理变量对AI决策的影响，需要一种数学上可证明的公平性保证方法。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理变量，构建捕获偏见模式完整结构的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法生成了与G独立的变量，同时最小化L2距离以保持准确性，保证了真正的独立性而不仅仅是去相关。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个可认证且数学基础扎实的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统，在贷款审批等任务中确保完全公平性。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见。

Method: 通过检查语言模型在不同经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型显示出与人类行为的一些一致性，但显著差异突显了需要改进生物中心的可操纵性测量。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成来解决对话AI中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问需求与响应延迟之间的根本矛盾，避免轻量模型缺乏推理深度和工具增强代理同步执行阻塞交互的问题。

Method: 采用三组件架构：知识充分性评估器进行实时评估、轻量响应生成器提供即时交互、异步知识精炼代理进行后台知识增强，通过智能触发机制实现连续对话流。

Result: 在TopiOCQA评估中，PMFR实现了95.3%的延迟降低（23.38秒→1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过时间解耦框架成功解决了延迟-质量权衡问题，证明了异步知识编排在保持对话质量的同时显著降低延迟的有效性。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法和基准，用于评估和增强大型推理模型在长视野多步推理任务中的能力，发现现有模型在此类任务上表现显著下降，并通过强化学习验证奖励训练提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型在复杂长视野场景中的理解和响应能力，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步推理任务的基准，并使用强化学习验证奖励进行训练。

Result: 评估发现最先进的大型推理模型在长视野任务中性能显著下降，存在有效推理长度有限和思考预算分配不当的问题。使用R-HORIZON进行RLVR训练不仅提升了多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提高了7.5个AIME2024分数。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AI多元主义指数(AIPI)，这是一个评估AI系统多元治理的透明、可验证的测量工具，旨在解决AI治理集中在少数实体的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家，可能导致技术编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。现有基准主要关注技术能力，缺乏对多元治理的公开可审计测量。

Method: 开发AIPI评估框架，包含四个支柱：参与式治理、包容性与多样性、透明度、问责制。通过可验证的公共证据和独立评估进行编码，处理"未知"证据，报告下限分数和已知分数。

Result: 建立了可复现的测量流程，包括结构化网络分析、外部评估和专家访谈。通过评分者间一致性、覆盖度报告等验证可靠性。发布了协议、代码本和证据图。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励措施转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据，促进AI系统的多元治理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解。让AI具备因果意识能提升性能，深入理解环境机制。

Method: 智能体在隐藏因果DAG的环境中通过重复干预学习，利用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下优于观测方法，常能以零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战配置中比最佳基线高0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: 通过干预学习因果结构的方法有效，DODO算法在因果发现任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

TL;DR: 该论文从因果视角重新审视推理任务，提出将推理视为选择机制，并引入SR²框架来学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，显著提升了推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使在大量预训练后仍无法可靠地进行推理。作者希望从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，为解决推理挑战提供见解。

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反射表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈整合到选择机制中，促进学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系。

Result: 实验显示该方法在推理准确性上取得显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，使用8倍更少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，是提升模型推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发严重担忧，需要揭示这些智能体的安全漏洞。

Method: CoTri后门攻击使用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中提取，实现多步操控以偏离智能体的预期任务。

Result: CoTri实现了接近完美的攻击成功率（ASR）和接近零的误触发率（FTR），同时意外提升了智能体在良性任务上的性能和对环境干扰的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri能够在智能体中实现稳定的多步控制，同时提高其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware
metanetworks as a powerful approach for efficient and generalizable neural
network optimization. Open-source code:

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了大型语言模型的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。通过实验发现训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次答案正确率，而非通过反思修正错误的能力。据此提出了动态截断反思的方法，显著减少推理token数量。

Motivation: 研究反思在大型语言模型推理能力提升中的实际贡献，探索反思行为的本质及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 系统分析了8个推理模型在5个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建了不同反思步骤的SFT数据集进行训练实验，并提出了基于候选答案的早期停止方法和动态截断反思策略。

Result: 反思行为主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次答案正确率；动态截断反思方法可减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理中主要起确认作用而非修正作用，通过动态截断不必要的反思步骤可以显著提高推理效率，同时保持较好的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了Cover@tau指标来替代Pass@k，用于更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Pass@k指标在大采样预算下会高估基础模型的推理边界，因为它反映了在大量尝试中成功的概率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，测量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，设置可靠性阈值来过滤随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估RLVR模型显示，相比Pass@1，流行算法的相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更准确地捕捉模型的真实推理能力，避免离散答案空间中随机猜测带来的评估偏差。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏见和规模限制，LLMs虽能模拟合成消费者，但直接要求数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法：从LLMs获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考声明的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查(9300个人类响应)测试中，SSR达到90%的人类重测可靠性，保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)，合成受访者还提供丰富的定性反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留了传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务上表现出色，可作为即插即用模块用于实际部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过专注于有效检索的策略，增强了LLM应用的泛化能力，解决了传统RAG和RL搜索代理的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于LLM的代码生成代理，通过集成领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索来解决机器学习工程中的AutoML和Kaggle竞赛任务，在有限时间内实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在机器学习工程任务中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，传统搜索方法限制了知识传递和搜索空间多样性，无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，使用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自进化和协作学习。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过领域知识集成和图搜索策略，显著提升了LLM在机器学习工程任务中的表现，证明了该方法在复杂搜索空间中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

TL;DR: CaRT方法通过反事实轨迹对和语言推理训练LLMs学习何时停止信息收集，在医疗诊断和数学解题任务中提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中策略性地收集相关信息，但现有模型缺乏何时停止收集信息并做出决策的能力，容易导致过度思考或偏离正轨。

Method: CaRT使用反事实轨迹对进行微调：一条轨迹在适当终止点停止，另一条是相同轨迹的轻微修改版本但不应终止。通过语言推理训练LLM解释终止决策的合理性。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT通过反事实推理和语言解释训练，有效提升了LLMs在策略性信息收集任务中的终止决策能力。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured
knowledge flow to drive subtask execution and reasoning. FlowSearch is capable
of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成的方法在图推理中存在局限性，检索质量限制生成效果，且专门化的检索器难以泛化到未见过的图结构。

Method: RoE将检索和生成统一为图探索过程，LLM逐步选择节点和边构建推理路径。采用两阶段训练：监督微调学习黄金推理路径，强化学习提升探索效果和泛化能力。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，RoE相比基线方法取得了显著的整体改进，并能有效泛化到未见过的图结构。

Conclusion: RoE通过统一的图探索框架解决了传统两阶段方法的局限性，为LLM在图结构推理任务中提供了更有效和可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning over structured graphs remains a fundamental challenge for Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly when scaling to large graphs. Existing
approaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:
first retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers
conditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often
struggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation
process is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the
retrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed
recently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training
graphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical
applicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel
approach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs
as a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate
nodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and
generating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is
trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness
and generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE
achieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also
generalizing effectively to unseen graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖点击、点赞等短期互动信号存在噪声大、稀疏性强的问题，无法有效捕捉长期用户满意度和留存率。

Method: 引入基于调查的Retentive Relevance指标，采用心理测量学方法验证其有效性，开发生产就绪的代理模型并集成到多阶段排序系统中。

Result: Retentive Relevance在预测次日留存方面显著优于互动信号和其他调查指标，尤其对历史互动有限的用户效果更佳；A/B实验显示能显著提升互动和留存，同时减少低质量内容曝光。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供了将内容级用户感知与生产系统留存结果关联的经验验证框架，为负责任AI发展提供了可扩展的用户中心解决方案。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement
signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these
signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user
satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel
content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users'
intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey
measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets
forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions
and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive
Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent,
discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we
show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals
and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for
users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy
model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage
ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based
on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention,
while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale
A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework
linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production
systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both
platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for
responsible AI development.

Motivation: 现代信息环境日益复杂，现有信息寻求模型难以完全捕捉其全貌，需要一个新的框架来更好地理解和表征用户-系统交互。

Method: 提出ISMIE框架，包含三个核心概念：组件（如信息寻求者）、干预变量（如交互变量）和活动（如获取）。通过错误信息传播案例研究分析六个现有IS和IR模型，展示ISMIE的应用价值。

Result: ISMIE框架能够有效揭示现有模型的局限性，并可作为可操作框架用于问题表征和实验设计，提出了针对AI生成内容真实性危机和多巴胺驱动内容消费的两个研究蓝图。

Conclusion: ISMIE框架为开发IS和IR模型提供了基础，有助于推进对现代信息环境中人机交互和系统设计的理解。

Abstract: The modern information environment (MIE) is increasingly complex, shaped by a
wide range of techniques designed to satisfy users' information needs.
Information seeking (IS) models are effective mechanisms for characterizing
user-system interactions. However, conceptualizing a model that fully captures
the MIE landscape poses a challenge. We argue: Does such a model exist? To
address this, we propose the Information Seeking in Modern Information
Environments (ISMIE) framework as a fundamental step. ISMIE conceptualizes the
information seeking process (ISP) via three key concepts: Components (e.g.,
Information Seeker), Intervening Variables (e.g., Interactive Variables), and
Activities (e.g., Acquiring). Using ISMIE's concepts and employing a case study
based on a common scenario - misinformation dissemination - we analyze six
existing IS and information retrieval (IR) models to illustrate their
limitations and the necessity of ISMIE. We then show how ISMIE serves as an
actionable framework for both characterization and experimental design. We
characterize three pressing issues and then outline two research blueprints: a
user-centric, industry-driven experimental design for the authenticity and
trust crisis to AI-generated content and a system-oriented, academic-driven
design for tackling dopamine-driven content consumption. Our framework offers a
foundation for developing IS and IR models to advance knowledge on
understanding human interactions and system design in MIEs.

Motivation: 传统视频检索方法依赖文本查询与视频元数据的直接匹配，难以弥合文本描述与视频多面性内容之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 1. 文本查询聚类机制捕获更广语义范围；2. Sweeper模块识别并减轻聚类中的噪声；3. VTC-Attention机制根据视频内容动态调整聚类内注意力。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上的实验表明，所提模型超越了现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: VTC框架通过文本查询聚类和注意力机制有效提升了视频检索性能，解决了语义鸿沟问题。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of video content across various platforms has
highlighted the urgent need for advanced video retrieval systems. Traditional
methods, which primarily depend on directly matching textual queries with video
metadata, often fail to bridge the semantic gap between text descriptions and
the multifaceted nature of video content. This paper introduces a novel
framework, the Video-Text Cluster (VTC), which enhances video retrieval by
clustering text queries to capture a broader semantic scope. We propose a
unique clustering mechanism that groups related queries, enabling our system to
consider multiple interpretations and nuances of each query. This clustering is
further refined by our innovative Sweeper module, which identifies and
mitigates noise within these clusters. Additionally, we introduce the
Video-Text Cluster-Attention (VTC-Att) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts
focus within the clusters based on the video content, ensuring that the
retrieval process emphasizes the most relevant textual features. Further
experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model surpasses existing
state-of-the-art models on five public datasets.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
mitigating hallucinations and outdated information issues, yet simultaneously
facilitates unauthorized data appropriation at scale. This paper addresses this
challenge through two key contributions. First, we introduce RPD, a novel
dataset specifically designed for RAG plagiarism detection that encompasses
diverse professional domains and writing styles, overcoming limitations in
existing resources. Second, we develop a dual-layered watermarking system that
embeds protection at both semantic and lexical levels, complemented by an
interrogator-detective framework that employs statistical hypothesis testing on
accumulated evidence. Extensive experimentation demonstrates our approach's
effectiveness across varying query volumes, defense prompts, and retrieval
parameters, while maintaining resilience against adversarial evasion
techniques. This work establishes a foundational framework for intellectual

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.

Motivation: 互补关系具有主观性且因人而异，传统基于历史数据的方法难以准确推断。研究者关注驱动物品组合的底层使用情境，假设人们通过想象具体使用场景来选择互补物品。

Method: 探索使用大语言模型生成物品使用场景作为构建互补推荐系统的起点，并通过人工标注评估生成场景的合理性。

Result: 约85%的LLM生成场景被判定为合理，表明大语言模型能够有效生成现实的物品使用场景。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生成物品使用场景方面表现良好，为构建基于使用情境的互补推荐系统提供了可行起点。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations suggest combinations of useful items that play
important roles in e-commerce. However, complementary relationships are often
subjective and vary among individuals, making them difficult to infer from
historical data. Unlike conventional history-based methods that rely on
statistical co-occurrence, we focus on the underlying usage context that
motivates item combinations. We hypothesized that people select complementary
items by imagining specific usage scenarios and identifying the needs in such
situations. Based on this idea, we explored the use of large language models
(LLMs) to generate item usage scenarios as a starting point for constructing
complementary recommendation systems. First, we evaluated the plausibility of
LLM-generated scenarios through manual annotation. The results demonstrated
that approximately 85% of the generated scenarios were determined to be
plausible, suggesting that LLMs can effectively generate realistic item usage
scenarios.

Conclusion: TaoSR-AGRL已成功部署在淘宝主搜索场景，为数亿用户提供服务，有效解决了LLM在电商搜索中的推理挑战

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and
has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic
understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and
business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative,
reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes
the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning
capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via
reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient
guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these
challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning
framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance.
TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which
decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned
with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which
identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted
ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating
reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on
large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human
evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO
baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence,
and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully
deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of
users.

Motivation: 现有的RAG系统在文档版本化时表现不佳，只能达到58-64%的准确率，无法进行时间有效性检查。

Method: 使用分层图结构捕获版本序列、内容边界和文档状态变化，通过意图分类进行查询路由，实现版本感知过滤和变更追踪。

Conclusion: 将版本化文档问答确立为独立任务，为未来研究提供了解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive
questions, retrieving semantically similar content without temporal validity
checks. We present VersionRAG, a version-aware RAG framework that explicitly
models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to
track undocumented modifications. Additionally, VersionRAG requires 97% fewer
tokens during indexing than GraphRAG, making it practical for large-scale
deployment. Our work establishes versioned document QA as a distinct task and
provides both a solution and benchmark for future research.

allows the model to effectively capture the complex semantic relationships
between queries and documents. Third, we implement ReasonEmbed across multiple

reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Notably, our ReasonEmbed-Qwen3-8B model
offers a record-high nDCG@10 score of 38.1 on the BRIGHT benchmark, which

Method: 基于移动游戏玩家的应用内购买特征，设计目标分解重构框架，先预测特定价格下的交易数量，再从中计算总支付金额。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上进行实验评估，并在TapTap RTB广告系统中与最先进的ZILN模型进行在线A/B测试。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过分解和重构框架有效解决了LTV分布复杂性带来的预测挑战。

Abstract: For Internet platforms operating real-time bidding (RTB) advertising service,
a comprehensive understanding of user lifetime value (LTV) plays a pivotal role
in optimizing advertisement allocation efficiency and maximizing the return on
investment (ROI) for advertisement sponsors, thereby facilitating growth of
commercialization revenue for the platform. However, the inherent complexity of
user LTV distributions induces significant challenges in accurate LTV
prediction. Existing state-of-the-art works, which primarily focus on directly
learning the LTV distributions through well-designed loss functions, achieve
limited success due to their vulnerability to outliers. In this paper, we
proposed a novel LTV prediction method to address distribution challenges
through an objective decomposition and reconstruction framework. Briefly
speaking, based on the in-app purchase characteristics of mobile gamers, our
model was designed to first predict the number of transactions at specific
prices and then calculate the total payment amount from these intermediate
predictions. Our proposed model was evaluated through experiments on real-world
industrial dataset, and deployed on the TapTap RTB advertising system for
online A/B testing along with the state-of-the-art ZILN model.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层融合策略和表示对齐方法，用于自监督音频视觉源分离，在多个数据集上达到了最先进的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法在音频视觉分离任务中的性能与声音特性密切相关，需要针对不同类型声音设计更有效的融合策略。

Method: 使用分层融合策略整合中期和晚期融合阶段，并提出表示对齐方法将音频编码器特征与预训练音频模型嵌入对齐。

Result: 在MUSIC、MUSIC-21和VGGSound数据集上的实验表明，该方法在自监督设置下超越了现有方法，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 分层融合策略能有效处理不同类型的声音，表示对齐方法减少了音频和视觉模态之间的模态差距。

Abstract: Self-supervised audio-visual source separation leverages natural correlations
between audio and vision modalities to separate mixed audio signals. In this
work, we first systematically analyse the performance of existing multimodal
fusion methods for audio-visual separation task, demonstrating that the
performance of different fusion strategies is closely linked to the
characteristics of the sound: middle fusion is better suited for handling
short, transient sounds, while late fusion is more effective for capturing
sustained and harmonically rich sounds. We thus propose a hierarchical fusion
strategy that effectively integrates both fusion stages. In addition, training
can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external audio
representations, rather than relying solely on the audio branch to learn them
independently. To explore this, we propose a representation alignment approach
that aligns the latent features of the audio encoder with embeddings extracted
from pre-trained audio models. Extensive experiments on MUSIC, MUSIC-21 and
VGGSound datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results, surpassing existing methods under the self-supervised setting. We
further analyse the impact of representation alignment on audio features,
showing that it reduces modality gap between the audio and visual modalities.

Motivation: 尽管全模态大语言模型快速发展，但对音频-视觉线索下情感推理的系统评估仍然有限，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建AV-EMO-Reasoning基准，包含精心策划的单轮和多轮合成音频-视觉语料库及真实世界数据集，在连续、分类和感知指标下进行评估。

Conclusion: AV-EMO-Reasoning为评估情感感知对话提供了可复现标准，推动了更自然、自适应的人机交互发展。

Abstract: Emotions conveyed through voice and face shape engagement and context in
human-AI interaction. Despite rapid progress in omni-modal large language
models (LLMs), the holistic evaluation of emotional reasoning with audiovisual
cues remains limited. To address this gap, we introduce AV-EMO-Reasoning, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess emotional coherence in LLMs. The
framework leverages a curated, single- and multi-turn synthetic audiovisual
corpus with a real-world set and is assessed under continuous, categorical, and
perceptual metrics. Experiments with leading LLMs show that visual cues
reliably improve emotional coherence over audio-only baselines. Moreover, LLMs
can leverage audio-visual cues to generate more emotion-aware speech. Models
exhibit complementary strengths across metric families, indicating that
automatic scores capture facets distinct from perceptual judgments. By
releasing a systematic evaluation benchmark, AV-EMO-Reasoning offers a
reproducible standard for evaluating emotion-aware dialogue and advances toward
more natural, adaptive human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向多云计算的租户预算感知数据复制框架(TCDRM)，通过动态创建数据副本，在满足响应时间和预算约束的同时优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多云计算系统在确保可接受性能同时遵守租户预算要求方面面临重大挑战，需要一种能够平衡性能和经济约束的智能数据复制策略。

Method: 采用启发式副本放置算法，利用多云提供商的不同定价结构，基于预定义的响应时间阈值、租户经济预算和数据流行度动态创建数据副本。

Result: 带宽消耗相比非复制方法减少高达78%，复杂查询的平均响应时间减少51%，同时严格遵守租户预算限制。

Conclusion: TCDRM策略有效实现了租户性能目标，同时尊重其经济约束，证明了在多云环境中智能数据复制的可行性。

Abstract: Multi-cloud computing systems face significant challenges in ensuring
acceptable performance while adhering to tenant budget requirements. This paper
proposes a tenant budget-aware (tenant-centric) data replication framework for
Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM). The proposed strategy dynamically creates data
replicas based on predefined thresholds for response time, economic budget of
the tenant and data popularity. TCDRM employs a heuristic replica placement
algorithm that leverages the diverse pricing structures of multiple cloud
providers. The TCDRM strategy aims to maintain the required performance without
exceeding the tenant's budget by taking advantage of the capabilities offered
by multicloud environments. The middleware considered acts as an intermediary
between tenants and multiple cloud providers, facilitating intelligent replica
placement decisions. To achieve this, the proposed TCDRM strategy defines
strict thresholds for tenant budget and response time. A performance evaluation
is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. The results show
that our approach effectively meets tenant performance objectives while
respecting their economic constraints. Bandwidth consumption is reduced by up
to 78% compared to non-replicated approaches, and average response time for
complex queries is decreased by 51%, all while adhering to tenant budget
limitations.

Motivation: 现有移动对象数据库系统要么过于复杂不适合生产环境，要么不够轻量级。MobilityDB虽然扩展了PostgreSQL的时空功能，但继承了其架构复杂性。

Method: 开发MobilityDuck作为DuckDB扩展，集成MEOS库来支持时空和其他时序数据类型，利用DuckDB的轻量级、列式、内存执行特性。

Result: 使用BerlinMOD-Hanoi基准数据集评估，MobilityDuck在保持时空查询表达能力的同时，受益于DuckDB的内存列式架构，性能优于MobilityDB。

Conclusion: MobilityDuck是首个提供原生时空类型和连续轨迹操作符的内存嵌入式分析系统，为时空数据分析提供了高效轻量的解决方案。

Abstract: The analytics of spatiotemporal data is increasingly important for mobility
analytics. Despite extensive research on moving object databases (MODs), few
systems are ready on production or lightweight enough for analytics. MobilityDB
is a notable system that extends PostgreSQL with spatiotemporal data, but it
inherits complexity of the architecture as well. In this paper, we present
MobilityDuck, a DuckDB extension that integrates the MEOS library to provide
support spatiotemporal and other temporal data types in DuckDB. MobilityDuck
leverages DuckDB's lightweight, columnar, in-memory executable properties to
deliver efficient analytics. To the best of our knowledge, no existing
in-memory or embedded analytical system offers native spatiotemporal types and
continuous trajectory operators as MobilityDuck does. We evaluate MobilityDuck
using the BerlinMOD-Hanoi benchmark dataset and compare its performance to
MobilityDB. Our results show that MobilityDuck preserves the expressiveness of
spatiotemporal queries while benefiting from DuckDB's in-memory, columnar
architecture.

TL;DR: ZeroCard是一种基于语义的基数估计方法，无需原始数据、查询日志或目标数据库重训练，通过模式语义预测数据分布，实现零依赖的基数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的基数估计方法严重依赖原始数据或查询，难以泛化到新数据集，限制了实际应用。作者认为模式语义可能有助于基数估计，并减轻这些依赖。

Method: 提出ZeroCard方法：1) 使用模式语义预测数据分布，避免原始数据依赖；2) 引入查询模板无关的表示方法减轻查询依赖；3) 在真实世界表构建的大规模查询数据集上预训练，从模式语义和谓词表示中学习基数。

Result: 实验证明ZeroCard具有明显优势，其零依赖特性显著促进了在实际场景中的部署。

Conclusion: ZeroCard是首个语义驱动的基数估计方法，无需任何原始数据访问、查询日志或目标数据库重训练，在查询优化中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义查询处理引擎使用嵌套循环实现语义连接，需要对每个行对调用LLM，效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 受传统数据库块嵌套循环连接启发，将两个输入表的行批次集成到单个提示中，让LLM识别当前批次中的所有匹配行对，并引入公式优化批次大小。

Result: 提出的方法显著降低了处理成本，在渐近处理成本分析和实证结果中表现优于现有语义查询处理引擎的连接实现。

Conclusion: 基于块嵌套循环连接的语义连接算法能有效减少LLM调用次数，提高语义查询处理效率，适用于输出大小难以估计的情况。

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.

Motivation: 研究高级持续性威胁(APT)中具有不同偏好的内部人员问题，解决内部人员偏好不确定性的挑战。

Method: 提出BG-FlipIn贝叶斯博弈框架，分析恶意、无意或腐败内部人员，计算闭式贝叶斯纳什均衡表达式，并推导三种确定性内部人员的纳什均衡边界情况。

Result: 发现了与防御者移动率和成本以及内部人员偏好相关的APT现象，为防御者提供不同参数条件下的决策指导。两个应用验证了该框架能使防御者做出一致决策，无需频繁检测内部人员具体偏好或调整策略。

Conclusion: BG-FlipIn框架有效解决了APT中内部人员偏好不确定性问题，为防御者提供了实用的决策支持工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we study advanced persistent threats (APT) with an insider who
has different preferences. To address the uncertainty of the insider's
preference, we propose the BG-FlipIn: a Bayesian game framework for
FlipIt-insider models with an investigation on malicious, inadvertent, or
corrupt insiders. We calculate the closed-form Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
expression and further obtain three edge cases with deterministic insiders
corresponding to their Nash Equilibrium expressions. On this basis, we further
discover several phenomena in APT related to the defender's move rate and cost,
as well as the insider's preferences. We then provide decision-making guidance
for the defender, given different parametric conditions. Two applications
validate that our BG-FlipIn framework enables the defender to make decisions
consistently, avoiding detecting the insider's concrete preference or adjusting
its strategy frequently.

<details>

Motivation: 传统Shapley值计算需要指数级复杂度或依赖蒙特卡洛采样，性能受随机过程影响。本研究旨在设计确定性算法来高效近似计算Shapley值。

Method: 设计了基于异构伯努利试验的确定性算法，在随机集（随机设备网络）的置信函数和Choquet容量框架下，通过线性或二次时间算法近似Shapley值。

Result: 提出了可在线性或二次时间内近似Shapley值的确定性算法，并提供了严格的误差分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络游戏中的Shapley值计算提供了高效的确定性算法，填补了Shapley原始证明中的空白，明确了二项式定理和Beta函数在证明中的作用。

Abstract: Suppose that $n$ computer devices are to be connected to a network via
inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials. The Shapley value of a device quantifies how
much the network's value increases due to the participation of that device.
Characteristic functions of such games are naturally taken as the belief
function (containment function) and Choquet capacity (hitting probability) of a
random set (random network of devices).
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is either calculated as the expected
marginal contribution over all possible coalitions (subnetworks), which results
in exponential computational complexity, or approximated by the Monte Carlo
sampling technique, where the performance is highly dependent on the stochastic
sampling process.
  The purpose of this study is to design deterministic algorithms for games
formulated via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials that approximate the Shapley
value in linear or quadratic time, with rigorous error analysis (Sections 3 and
4). Additionally, we provide a review of relevant literature on existing
calculation methods in Remark 3.1 and Appendix I.
  A further goal is to supplement Shapley's original proof by deriving the
Shapley value formula using a rigorous approach based on definite integrals and
combinatorial analysis. This method explicitly highlights the roles of the
Binomial Theorem and the Beta function in the proof, addressing a gap in
Shapley's work (Appendix II).

Motivation: 解决标准数系统在建模无限认知感知时的局限性，特别是游戏理论中与直觉相悖的有限视界悖论。

Conclusion: 通过将数学基础建立在不同人类认知模式上，扩展了游戏理论在长期视界场景中的解释能力。

Abstract: This paper argues that the finite horizon paradox, where game theory
contradicts intuition, stems from the limitations of standard number systems in
modelling the cognitive perception of infinity. To address this issue, we
propose a new framework based on Alternative Set Theory (AST). This framework
represents different cognitive perspectives on a long history of events using
distinct topologies. These topologies define an indiscernibility equivalence
that formally treats huge, indistinguishable quantities as equivalent. This
offers criterion-dependent resolutions to long-standing paradoxes, such as
Selten's chain store paradox and Rosenthal's centipede game. Our framework
reveals new intuitive subgame perfect equilibria, the characteristics of which
depend on the chosen temporal perspective and payoff evaluation. Ultimately, by
grounding its mathematical foundation in different modes of human cognition,
our work expands the explanatory power of game theory for long-horizon
scenarios.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication
abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of
individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies
are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and
addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic
children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the
foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite
to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor
emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding
of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in
the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.
Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a
targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to
meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a
sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep
understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis
for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early
identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and
supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational
and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Conclusion: MACC-MGNAS有效解决了多模态图神经网络架构搜索中的模态异质性挑战，在漏洞共利用预测任务上取得了显著性能提升和计算效率改进。

Abstract: Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to
enterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and
multimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are
well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby
improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN
architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific
components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic
algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural
solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook
modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware
cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture
search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative
co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a
coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific
gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator
reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively
captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we
introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce
evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a
similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively
balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and
avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)
dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,
outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing
computation cost by 27%.

Motivation: 现有多模态学习模型存在两个关键问题：1）不同数据模态学习不均衡，导致模型偏向某些模态；2）模型可能偏向某些人口群体，造成不公平性能。这两个方面相互影响，导致不平衡且不公平的多模态学习。

Conclusion: MultiFair有效解决了多模态医疗分类中的模态偏差和群体不公平问题，为构建更可靠、无偏的诊断系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to
ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning
models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical
challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby
converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may
emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.
The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may
favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and
unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called
MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these
challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically
modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude
at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two
multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show
that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness
learning methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化日益破坏农业系统，需要准确的作物产量预测来保障粮食安全。虽然深度学习模型在利用卫星和天气数据进行产量预测方面显示出潜力，但其跨地理区域和年份的泛化能力（对实际部署至关重要）尚未得到充分测试。

Method: 使用覆盖2017-2022年1200多个美国县的大规模CropNet数据集，在现实的分布外(OOD)条件下对GNN-RNN和MMST-ViT两种最先进模型进行基准测试，采用跨七个USDA农场资源区域的留一聚类交叉验证和年度预测场景。

Result: GNN-RNN在地理转移下表现出优越的泛化能力，具有正相关性，而MMST-ViT在域内表现良好但在OOD条件下急剧退化。Heartland和Northern Great Plains等区域显示出稳定的转移动态，而Prairie Gateway在所有模型和作物中持续表现不佳。GNN-RNN的训练速度比MMST-ViT快135倍。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，时空对齐（而不仅仅是模型复杂性或数据规模）是稳健泛化的关键，并强调需要透明的OOD评估协议来确保公平可靠的气候感知农业预测。

Abstract: Climate change is increasingly disrupting agricultural systems, making
accurate crop yield forecasting essential for food security. While deep
learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and
weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years -
critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two
state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset
spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out
cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead
prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region
transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive
correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain
but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern
Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for
soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE
greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural
dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and
incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves
135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more
viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that
spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key
to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation
protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural
forecasting.

*Qinghua Liu,Sam Heshmati,Zheda Mai,Zubin Abraham,John Paparrizos,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLLM4TS是一个利用多模态大语言模型进行时间序列分析的框架，通过将时间序列数据转换为视觉表示来弥合数值数据与自然语言之间的模态差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分析面临复杂时间依赖性和跨通道交互的挑战，受人类视觉检查时间序列的启发，探索视觉表示是否能增强自动化分析。多模态大语言模型具有强大的泛化和视觉理解能力，但在时间序列应用上受到模态差距的限制。

Method: 引入MLLM4TS框架，将每个时间序列通道渲染为水平堆叠的彩色线图，使用时间感知视觉块对齐策略将视觉块与对应时间片段对齐，融合数值数据的细粒度时间细节和视觉表示的全局上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MLLM4TS在预测任务（如分类）和生成任务（如异常检测和预测）中均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了将视觉模态与预训练语言模型结合以实现稳健和可泛化时间序列分析的潜力。

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to
the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in
multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time
series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual
representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in
multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series
remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and
discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel
framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general
time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series
channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one
composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a
temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with
their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details
from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the
visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal
time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g.,
classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting).
These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with
pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series
analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ConCuR数据集和KernelCoder模型，通过生成高质量CUDA内核和推理轨迹来解决内核生成任务中高质量数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核生成面临高质量数据稀缺的挑战，因为大多数高质量内核是专有的且不开源，这阻碍了使用监督微调来对齐LLMs进行内核生成任务。

Method: 开发了一个生成和筛选高质量CUDA内核及推理轨迹的流水线，构建ConCuR数据集，并训练KernelCoder模型，这是首个在包含PyTorch、推理和CUDA内核对的数据集上训练的模型。

Result: 在KernelBench设置中，该模型显著优于现有表现最佳的QwQ-32B模型，超越了所有为内核生成微调的开源模型以及前沿模型如DeepSeek-V3.1-Think和Claude-4-sonnet。

Conclusion: 平均推理长度可以作为评估内核生成任务难度的指标，该研究的方法、指标和数据收集流水线有助于未来获得更好的内核生成数据。

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development,
leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a
key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as
most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge
prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel
generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that
generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces,
motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning
traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this
pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder,
which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch,
reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup,
our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing
model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel
generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and
Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve
as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The
observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help
obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

TL;DR: ETD方法通过在推理时迭代特定层来增强语言模型的推理能力，无需改变模型架构或增加参数，在多个推理基准上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提升LLM推理能力的方法要么扩大模型规模和数据量，要么通过复杂思维链增加推理计算。研究发现推理所需的关键计算集中在有限层中，因此开发了更高效的方法。

Method: ETD方法在中间训练阶段训练基础模型在推理相关层上进行迭代，保持原始架构、参数和训练数据不变，推理时在选定层上进行迭代计算。

Result: 在17个推理基准上取得显著提升，OLMo-2 1B模型在GSM8K上相对准确率提升28.4%，在MATH上提升36%。自适应深度策略能根据输入调整计算量。

Conclusion: 递归潜在推理为增强LLM推理能力提供了一条简单有效的路径，无需改变模型架构即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Most efforts to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) involve either scaling the number of parameters and the size of training
data, or scaling inference computation by letting models generate complex
chains of thought. Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the
crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited
range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances
the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a
small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD
amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture,
parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating
on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on
17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on
GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an
adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our
results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path
to stronger LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出SurpMark方法，通过量化token surprisal动态来检测机器生成文本，使用广义Jensen-Shannon差距比较测试文本与人类/机器参考语料的状态转移矩阵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒检测机器生成文本的实际约束：评分模型可能与未知源模型不匹配，且对比生成成本高昂。

Method: 将surprisal量化为可解释状态，估计测试文本的状态转移矩阵，通过广义Jensen-Shannon差距与固定参考（人类vs机器历史语料）进行比较。

Result: 在多个数据集、源模型和场景下，SurpMark始终匹配或超越基线方法，实验证实统计量的渐近正态性和离散化有效性。

Conclusion: SurpMark是一种有效的参考检测器，能够在实际约束下可靠检测机器生成文本。

Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical
constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source
model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a
reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token
surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates
a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized
Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references
(human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled
discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision
statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios,
SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments
corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed discretization.

Motivation: 研究线性上下文赌博机中的付费观测问题，学习者可以选择支付固定成本来观察任何臂的损失，旨在设计一个既能处理对抗性环境又能适应随机环境的算法。

Method: 基于Follow-the-Regularized-Leader框架，通过矩阵几何重采样构建高效估计器，开发计算高效的Best-of-Both-Worlds算法。

Result: 算法在对抗性设置中实现了Θ(T^{2/3})的最小最大最优遗憾，在（损坏的）随机环境中保证了多对数遗憾。

Conclusion: 该方法为"困难问题"设计了BOBW算法，使用针对所考虑设置量身定制的分析技术，实现了在对抗性和随机环境中的最优性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of linear contextual bandits with paid observations,
where at each round the learner selects an action in order to minimize its loss
in a given context, and can then decide to pay a fixed cost to observe the loss
of any arm. Building on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework with
efficient estimators via Matrix Geometric Resampling, we introduce a
computationally efficient Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm for this
problem. We show that it achieves the minimax-optimal regret of
$\Theta(T^{2/3})$ in adversarial settings, while guaranteeing poly-logarithmic
regret in (corrupted) stochastic regimes. Our approach builds on the framework
from \cite{BOBWhardproblems} to design BOBW algorithms for ``hard problem'',
using analysis techniques tailored for the setting that we consider.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在标记数据有限且存在分布偏移的情况下，如何提升模型泛化能力的问题。多模态协同训练可以利用未标记数据并通过模态间一致性来增强模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用多模态协同训练框架，通过理论分析推导了使用未标记数据和促进模态间分类器一致性的条件，进行了收敛性分析，并建立了新的泛化边界。

Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance
model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and
distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of
this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and
the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to
significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence
analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing
classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound
that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and
quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal
data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view
independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal
co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI
systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments.
The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of,
established co-training principles.

*Wang Wei,Tiankai Yang,Hongjie Chen,Yue Zhao,Franck Dernoncourt,Ryan A. Rossi,Hoda Eldardiry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaRP是一种基于偏好调优的上下文多臂老虎机路由方法，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，支持在推理时无需重新训练即可调整性能/成本权衡，显著优于离线路由器和最大LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM部署中的效率问题：传统离线路由方法需要所有候选模型的标签，这在部署中不现实，因为只能观察到所选模型的结果。需要一种在部分反馈限制下训练的方法。

Method: 将LLM路由建模为基于提示特征和用户偏好向量的上下文多臂老虎机问题，在训练时模拟在线反馈环境，自适应地为每个新提示做出路由决策。

Result: 实验表明，该方法持续优于强离线路由器至少12.46%，优于最大LLM至少2.45%，并且在未见任务上具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BaRP方法成功地将训练条件与部署条件对齐，支持偏好可调推理，在性能和成本权衡方面提供了灵活性和优越性能。

Abstract: Efficient use of large language models (LLMs) is critical for deployment at
scale: without adaptive routing, systems either overpay for strong models or
risk poor performance from weaker ones. Selecting the right LLM for each query
is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices
fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are
trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks
in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We
bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach
that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while
supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the
performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a
contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method
simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing
decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline
supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at
least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习可以加速强化学习，但在马尔可夫链训练样本下，现有TD学习方法需要依赖未知问题参数才能达到最优收敛速率，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用两时间尺度的联邦时序差分学习结合Polyak-Ruppert平均，构建参数无关的FTD方法，适用于异构环境。

Result: 该方法在平均奖励和折扣设置下均能证明达到最优的O~(1/NT)收敛速率，且适用于异构联邦学习场景。

Conclusion: 提出的FTD方法填补了联邦强化学习在马尔可夫数据下的理论空白，为异构环境下的参数无关联邦TD学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) can dramatically speed up reinforcement learning by
distributing exploration and training across multiple agents. It can guarantee
an optimal convergence rate that scales linearly in the number of agents, i.e.,
a rate of $\tilde{O}(1/(NT)),$ where $T$ is the iteration index and $N$ is the
number of agents. However, when the training samples arise from a Markov chain,
existing results on TD learning achieving this rate require the algorithm to
depend on unknown problem parameters. We close this gap by proposing a
two-timescale Federated Temporal Difference (FTD) learning with Polyak-Ruppert
averaging. Our method provably attains the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/NT)$ rate in
both average-reward and discounted settings--offering a parameter-free FTD
approach for Markovian data. Although our results are novel even in the
single-agent setting, they apply to the more realistic and challenging scenario
of FL with heterogeneous environments.

Motivation: 科学文献中药代动力学信息的提取和标准化是计算药理学中的重大挑战，限制了药物开发中数据驱动模型的可靠性。LLMs在文本理解方面取得进展，但在处理PK表格等结构化生物医学数据时受到异质性、噪声和领域偏移的限制。

Method: HySim-LLM统一数学和计算框架，集成嵌入加权微调和流形感知去噪。建立了两个理论结果：(1)基于相似性的泛化边界量化嵌入差异下的适应性能；(2)基于流形的去噪保证限制噪声或离流样本的损失贡献。

Result: 为结构化生物医学环境中微调LLMs提供了原则性理论基础，增强了模型对噪声和领域偏移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学和数据密集型科学领域中可靠且可解释的LLM适应提供了数学基础路径。

Abstract: The extraction and standardization of pharmacokinetic (PK) information from
scientific literature remain significant challenges in computational
pharmacology, which limits the reliability of data-driven models in drug
development. Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
text understanding and reasoning, yet their adaptation to structured biomedical
data, such as PK tables, remains constrained by heterogeneity, noise, and
domain shift. To address these limitations, we propose HySim-LLM, a unified
mathematical and computational framework that integrates embedding-weighted
fine-tuning and manifold-aware denoising to enhance the robustness and
interpretability of LLMs. We establish two theoretical results: (1) a
similarity-weighted generalization bound that quantifies adaptation performance
under embedding divergence, and (2) a manifold-based denoising guarantee that
bounds loss contributions from noisy or off-manifold samples. These theorems
provide a principled foundation for fine-tuning LLMs in structured biomedical
settings. The framework offers a mathematically grounded pathway toward
reliable and interpretable LLM adaptation for biomedical and data-intensive
scientific domains.

Motivation: 改进神经网络风险证书的可用性，特别是在PAC-Bayes边界框架下，以提供更紧的泛化保证。

Method: 1. 推导伯努利分布KL散度的两个边界；2. 基于隐式微分的方法将PAC-Bayesian风险证书优化集成到模型训练中；3. 优化非可微目标（如0-1损失）的边界。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上实现了首个非平凡泛化边界，提供了最紧的显式分类器真实风险边界。

Conclusion: 提出的理论贡献显著提高了神经网络风险证书的实用性和紧致性，为神经网络泛化分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability
of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two
bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the
derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers
across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the
formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation
that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk
certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model.
The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable
objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are
complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on
CIFAR-10 for neural networks.

<details>

Motivation: 传统混合专家模型仅提供点估计，无法量化预测不确定性，而时序预测中不确定性评估对决策至关重要。

Method: 将每个专家输出建模为高斯分布，用专家估计的方差来确定其对最终预测的贡献，替代传统的基于输入的门控网络。

Result: 在多个时序预测基准测试中，MoGU始终优于单专家模型和传统混合专家设置，并提供与预测误差直接相关的良好量化不确定性。

Conclusion: MoGU框架通过不确定性量化增强了预测可靠性，在时序预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Mixture-of-Gaussians with Uncertainty-based Gating (MoGU), a
novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed for regression tasks and
applied to time series forecasting. Unlike conventional MoEs that provide only
point estimates, MoGU models each expert's output as a Gaussian distribution.
This allows it to directly quantify both the forecast (the mean) and its
inherent uncertainty (variance). MoGU's core innovation is its
uncertainty-based gating mechanism, which replaces the traditional input-based
gating network by using each expert's estimated variance to determine its
contribution to the final prediction. Evaluated across diverse time series
forecasting benchmarks, MoGU consistently outperforms single-expert models and
traditional MoE setups. It also provides well-quantified, informative
uncertainties that directly correlate with prediction errors, enhancing
forecast reliability. Our code is available from:

Motivation: 解决层次数据中贝叶斯混合效应回归计算成本高的问题，传统MCMC方法分析困难且耗时

Method: 使用基于Transformer的神经网络模型进行神经后验估计，通过预训练模拟数据集来分摊计算成本

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上达到与MCMC方法相当的稳定性能，但所需时间显著减少

Conclusion: metabeta模型为贝叶斯混合效应回归提供了一种高效替代方案，大幅降低了计算成本

Abstract: Hierarchical data with multiple observations per group is ubiquitous in
empirical sciences and is often analyzed using mixed-effects regression. In
such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is
analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of
computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated
datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a
transformer-based neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression.
Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable
performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually
required time.

Motivation: RLVR使用简单的二元反馈来后训练大语言模型，在实践中取得了显著成功，但缺乏对其工作原理的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析RLVR在完整响应和令牌级别的训练过程，引入梯度间隙概念来形式化从低奖励到高奖励区域的改进方向，并推导收敛条件和步长阈值。

Result: 证明了收敛依赖于更新方向与梯度间隙的对齐，推导了基于梯度间隙大小的尖锐步长阈值，并预测了临界步长如何随响应长度和成功率缩放。

Conclusion: 理论解释了为什么长度归一化等实用启发式方法能提高稳定性，并表明固定学习率下成功率可能停滞在100%以下，这些预测通过受控模拟和LLM实验得到了验证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple
binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant
empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been
lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its
training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.
Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes
the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the
response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the
update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size
threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning
converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts
how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success
rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization
improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success
rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through
controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training
Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.

Conclusion: 张量补全是一种有效的替代模型，特别适用于训练数据存在偏置采样的材料设计场景，能够加速晶格结构的优化设计过程。

Abstract: When designing new materials, it is often necessary to design a material with
specific desired properties. Unfortunately, as new design variables are added,
the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating
the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this
work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to
mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine
learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials
design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training
data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random
sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might
synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of
convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a
surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical
supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor
completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and
XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\% increased
$R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a
uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.

Result: 在27,254名百万退伍军人计划参与者数据上训练，HEMERA实现了>99%的AUC评分，模型预测与已知肺癌风险位点高度一致。

Abstract: Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of
cancer deaths in the US. Although smoking is the primary risk factor, the
occurrence of LC in never-smokers and familial aggregation studies highlight a
genetic component. Genetic biomarkers identified through genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) are promising tools for assessing LC risk. We
introduce HEMERA (Human-Explainable Transformer Model for Estimating Lung
Cancer Risk using GWAS Data), a new framework that applies explainable
transformer-based deep learning to GWAS data of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for predicting LC risk. Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly
processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive
positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant
filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated
Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning
strongly with known LC risk loci. Trained on data from 27,254 Million Veteran
Program participants, HEMERA achieved >99% AUC (area under receiver
characteristics) score. These findings support transparent,
hypothesis-generating models for personalized LC risk assessment and early
intervention.

Abstract: Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and
industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable
Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges.
Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources
available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart
wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new
computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context,
task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby
edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a
framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We
formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy
consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task
offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the
Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task
offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications
and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show
how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the
overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average
energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.

Motivation: 现有研究通常只检查孤立的攻击面或特定场景，缺乏对多智能体系统漏洞的整体理解，需要系统性的评估基准。

Method: 引入PEAR基准测试，专注于广泛采用的规划者-执行者结构，通过大量实验系统评估多智能体系统的效用和脆弱性。

Result: 发现：弱规划者比弱执行者更严重影响任务性能；规划者需要记忆模块而执行者不需要；任务性能与鲁棒性存在权衡；针对规划者的攻击特别有效。

Conclusion: 这些发现为增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性提供了可行见解，并为多智能体环境中的原则性防御奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a
powerful paradigm for tackling complex, multi-step tasks across diverse
domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible
to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack
surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS
vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for
systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of
planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our
benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and
widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak
planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak
executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a
memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3)
there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4)
attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the
system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness
of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的睡眠分期对睡眠障碍诊断至关重要，传统方法依赖人工标注或EEG信号的时域/频域特征，需要更自动化和鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用连续小波变换(CWT)生成时频图捕捉睡眠分期的瞬态和振荡模式，结合集成学习方法进行分类。

Result: 在Sleep-EDF数据库上达到88.37%总体准确率和73.15宏平均F1分数，优于传统机器学习方法，与近期深度学习方法性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 小波分析为睡眠分期提供了鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的分类方法，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages is crucial for the diagnosis and
management of sleep disorders. Conventional approaches for sleep scoring rely
on manual annotation or features extracted from EEG signals in the time or
frequency domain. This study proposes a novel framework for automated sleep
stage scoring using time-frequency analysis based on the wavelet transform. The
Sleep-EDF Expanded Database (sleep-cassette recordings) was used for
evaluation. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency
maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency
bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning,
achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of
73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting
comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches. These
findings highlight the potential of wavelet analysis for robust, interpretable,
and clinically applicable sleep stage classification.

TL;DR: 提出FairSpecTemp方法从图平稳节点观测中估计公平图，确保连接不偏袒敏感属性，包含两种变体：直接约束偏见的显式方法和通过限制图谱间接鼓励公平的隐式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中的边往往对某些群体对表现出连接偏好，这种有偏连接会加剧甚至引发下游图任务的歧视性处理，因此需要确保图的公平性。

Method: 提出FairSpecTemp优化方法，包含两种变体：一种利用图平稳性的交换性质直接约束偏见，另一种通过限制图谱间接鼓励公平估计。方法提供概率性能边界，在公平性和准确性之间实现条件权衡。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上评估FairSpecTemp，证明其有效性并突出两种变体的优势。分析表明恢复公平图不必牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: FairSpecTemp能够有效估计公平图，提供多种偏见度量方法，包括谱域中的新测量，为图公平性研究提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We estimate fair graphs from graph-stationary nodal observations such that
connections are not biased with respect to sensitive attributes. Edges in
real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of
groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair
treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and
individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level
definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we
provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral
domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an
optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from
stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many
existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of
graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly
encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus
more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding
a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our
analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs.
We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate
its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of
FairSpecTemp.

Result: 在二维不可压缩圆柱绕流CFD示例中，构建的tDT能够准确预测长期流体动力，完全绕过全流场模拟。

Conclusion: FML-based tDT方法能够高效准确地预测QoIs的长期动态，显著降低计算成本，为复杂系统分析提供实用工具。

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for constructing a targeted digital twin
(tDT) that directly models the dynamics of quantities of interest (QoIs) in a
full digital twin (DT). The proposed approach employs memory-based flow map
learning (FML) to develop a data-driven model of the QoIs using short bursts of
trajectory data generated through repeated executions of the full DT. This
renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational
process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and
analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the
full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After
introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction
and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this
problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs
are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit
knowledge of the underlying flow field. Numerical results show that the tDTs
yield accurate long-term predictions of the forces while entirely bypassing
full flow simulations.

Motivation: 作为理解dropout在大型神经网络中作用的第一步，研究dropout在两层神经网络中的大宽度渐近行为，以揭示其在不同参数设置下的动态特性。

Method: 使用平均场初始化尺度，研究梯度下降与dropout在两层神经网络中的大宽度渐近行为，通过混合平均场粒子系统和随机过程的工具进行收敛证明。

Result: 获得了丰富的渐近相图，显示五个不同的非退化相。发现dropout的惩罚效应仅在O(1/宽度)量级的极小学习率下存在，而在实际学习率下等效于随机几何技术。极限由平均场跳跃过程描述。

Conclusion: 研究结果为重新理论理解大规模神经网络中的dropout奠定了基础，揭示了dropout在不同学习率下的本质差异。

Abstract: Dropout is a standard training technique for neural networks that consists of
randomly deactivating units at each step of their gradient-based training. It
is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale
training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding
the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width
asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with
the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram
that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative
magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we
find that the well-studied "penalty" effect of dropout only persists in the
limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\text{width})$. For
larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is
equivalent to a "random geometry" technique, where the gradients are thinned
randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this
asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where
the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks
(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the
phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in
distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from
mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay
the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in
large-scale neural networks.

Abstract: This study applies BERTopic, a transformer-based topic modeling technique, to
the lmsys-chat-1m dataset, a multilingual conversational corpus built from
head-to-head evaluations of large language models (LLMs). Each user prompt is
paired with two anonymized LLM responses and a human preference label, used to
assess user evaluation of competing model outputs. The main objective is
uncovering thematic patterns in these conversations and examining their
relation to user preferences, particularly if certain LLMs are consistently
preferred within specific topics. A robust preprocessing pipeline was designed
for multilingual variation, balancing dialogue turns, and cleaning noisy or
redacted data. BERTopic extracted over 29 coherent topics including artificial
intelligence, programming, ethics, and cloud infrastructure. We analysed
relationships between topics and model preferences to identify trends in
model-topic alignment. Visualization techniques included inter-topic distance
maps, topic probability distributions, and model-versus-topic matrices. Our
findings inform domain-specific fine-tuning and optimization strategies for
improving real-world LLM performance and user satisfaction.

Abstract: In this work, we present LOTUS (Learning to Learn with Optimal Transport for
Unsupervised Scenarios), a simple yet effective method to perform model
selection for multiple unsupervised machine learning(ML) tasks such as outlier
detection and clustering. Our intuition behind this work is that a machine
learning pipeline will perform well in a new dataset if it previously worked
well on datasets with a similar underlying data distribution. We use Optimal
Transport distances to find this similarity between unlabeled tabular datasets
and recommend machine learning pipelines with one unified single method on two
downstream unsupervised tasks: outlier detection and clustering. We present the
effectiveness of our approach with experiments against strong baselines and
show that LOTUS is a very promising first step toward model selection for
multiple unsupervised ML tasks.

Abstract: Symbolic regression refers to the task of finding a closed-form mathematical
expression to fit a set of data points. Genetic programming based techniques
are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,
neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading
neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize
transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on
encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to
generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned
only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all
tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose
Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which
simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete
token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we
compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model
based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures.
We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for
symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved
performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying
architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based
symbolic regression.

Abstract: This review aims to conduct a comparative analysis of liquid neural networks
(LNNs) and traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their variants,
such as long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and gated recurrent units
(GRUs). The core dimensions of the analysis include model accuracy, memory
efficiency, and generalization ability. By systematically reviewing existing
research, this paper explores the basic principles, mathematical models, key
characteristics, and inherent challenges of these neural network architectures
in processing sequential data. Research findings reveal that LNN, as an
emerging, biologically inspired, continuous-time dynamic neural network,
demonstrates significant potential in handling noisy, non-stationary data, and
achieving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Additionally, some LNN
variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and
computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling
due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks.
This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs,
summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out
valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the
importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in
broader and more complex scenarios.

Motivation: 当前LLM的环境交互必须通过文本格式表达，需要手工解析器，这使语言模型同时承担推理和控制职责。作者希望将环境交互从语言中解耦，简化交互过程。

Method: 提出ExpA框架，允许模型在语言环境和外部环境之间切换；引入EARL强化学习算法，使用反事实策略优化来探索扩展动作空间。

Conclusion: ExpA框架成功将环境交互从语言中解耦，EARL算法能有效探索扩展动作空间，在复杂交互任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but
their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a
result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators
or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,
and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with
both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external
to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language
by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the
vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but
may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.
From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive
feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a
result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new
environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with
counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions
and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with
vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based
multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves
perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm
competitive with classical designs.

Conclusion: TGM不仅提供了高效的计算性能，还通过支持动态图属性预测和时间驱动训练范式，开启了之前难以研究的新研究方向。

Abstract: Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML)
research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric
and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks
comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific
architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving
field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic
graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To
address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a
research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG
and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features,
time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and
graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across
multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an
average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available
implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks
entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property
prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions
previously impractical to study. TGM is available at

Method: 引入增量合成数据基准测试，提出基于自注意力机制的Transformer模型，通过重构训练但主要从学习到的注意力权重偏差中推导异常分数。

Result: Transformer模型普遍优于其他方法，但所有模型都对高频局部噪声表现出显著脆弱性；提出的模型在保持准确度的同时具有更好的推理速度。

Conclusion: 未来iSHM模型需要增强噪声鲁棒性，基于注意力的高效方法为开发实用车载异常检测系统提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Indirect structural health monitoring (iSHM) for broken rail detection using
onboard sensors presents a cost-effective paradigm for railway track
assessment, yet reliably detecting small, transient anomalies (2-10 cm) remains
a significant challenge due to complex vehicle dynamics, signal noise, and the
scarcity of labeled data limiting supervised approaches. This study addresses
these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental
synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness
against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel
inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark,
we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed
Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism,
trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily
from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and
computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while
transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit
significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this
as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model
achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while
demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for
enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more
efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing
practical onboard anomaly detection systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGTEN是一个用于动态信任评估的图神经网络框架，通过高斯分布表示节点和边的不确定性，结合时间建模和防御机制，在比特币信任网络中显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型快速演化的图需要能够捕捉变化关系、表达校准置信度并抵抗对抗性操纵的信任评估模型。

Method: 使用高斯分布表示节点和边，结合HAGH位置编码、KAN注意力机制和ODE残差学习模块，采用鲁棒自适应集成系数分析来防御攻击。

Result: 在比特币信任网络中，单时间槽预测MCC提升10.77%，冷启动场景MCC提升16.41%，在对抗攻击下MCC提升达11.63%。

Conclusion: DGTEN统一框架在动态信任评估中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models
that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and
resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation
Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by
combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and
built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges
as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic
uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware
trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves,
it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with
Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly
capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient
analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary
cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering,
sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN
delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on
Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the
cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all
tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline
by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified
DGTEN framework.

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型（LLM）的遗忘方法进行了系统分类和评估，提出了更全面的评估指标，揭示了当前评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM遗忘研究碎片化，缺乏对有效遗忘的明确定义和严谨评估标准，现有评估方法（如多选题准确率）过于片面，无法反映模型的实际生成行为。

Method: 提出了12种状态遗忘方法的分类体系，分为三类：差异驱动优化、表示错配和基于拒绝的定向遗忘。引入了开放问答（Open-QA）评估指标，并对WMDP基准进行了重新评估。

Result: 发现当前基于多选题准确率的评估高估了遗忘效果，Open-QA指标更好地揭示了生成性能，并显示出UE-UT权衡关系。不同方法家族在鲁棒性方面存在显著差异。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘需要更全面的评估框架，应考虑生成行为而不仅仅是选择题表现，同时需要细粒度分析不同攻击场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for large language models (LLMs) aims to remove undesired
data, knowledge, and behaviors (e.g., for safety, privacy, or copyright) while
preserving useful model capabilities. Despite rapid progress over the past two
years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on
what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously
evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent
stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families:
divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and
rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the
evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and
robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that
current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy,
offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking
the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open
question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance
and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example,
vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and
out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks.
Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning
and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.

Abstract: In multi-armed bandits with network interference (MABNI), the action taken by
one node can influence the rewards of others, creating complex interdependence.
While existing research on MABNI largely concentrates on minimizing regret, it
often overlooks the crucial concern that an excessive emphasis on the optimal
arm can undermine the inference accuracy for sub-optimal arms. Although initial
efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios,
these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this
paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier
characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy
in adversarial (design-based) MABNI. We further introduce an anytime-valid
asymptotic confidence sequence along with a corresponding algorithm,
$\texttt{EXP3-N-CS}$, specifically designed to balance the trade-off between
regret minimization and inference accuracy in this setting.

Motivation: 持续学习面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有深度学习模型在顺序学习多个任务时会丢失先前学到的知识。正则化技术可以通过约束模型参数来防止过拟合，但需要更有效的方法来解决持续学习中的遗忘问题。

Method: 在损失函数中引入基于类间分离的正则化项，惩罚模型输出与先前任务数据形成的聚类中心之间的距离。通过超参数调优找到正则化项的最佳权重，确保神经网络内部表示中任务之间有更清晰的分离。

Result: 在标准的5任务Split CIFAR-10基准测试和ResNet-18架构上，ICS在保持初始任务性能方面表现出有效性。但随着任务数量增加，长期知识保留存在局限性。

Conclusion: ICS方法在缓解灾难性遗忘方面有效，但持续学习仍然存在复杂性和权衡，特别是在长期知识保留方面需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Continual learning the ability of a neural network to learn multiple
sequential tasks without losing previously acquired knowledge remains a
significant obstacle to developing truly adaptive artificial intelligence. Deep
learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but
overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent
overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent
catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization
technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which
penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids
of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed
hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed
regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the
neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating
forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18
architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong
performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations
in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks
increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual
learning and points toward avenues for further research.

Motivation: 传统分布强化学习方法将回报分布简化为离散分类分布或有限分位数，无法捕捉精细的回报分布结构，也难以识别高不确定性的状态用于决策。

Method: 使用灵活的流模型估计完整未来回报分布，提出新的流匹配目标满足分布贝尔曼方程，通过流导数ODE估计状态回报不确定性，并利用不确定性信息优先学习更准确的回报估计。

Conclusion: 基于流模型的分布强化学习方法能够有效学习完整回报分布并识别高不确定性状态，在离线和在线到在线设置中均优于现有方法。

Abstract: While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of
future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the
return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable
applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for
estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical
distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles,
such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of
the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return
uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern,
flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and
identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new
flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the
distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we
estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative
ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a
more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method
(Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings.
Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks
demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\times$ improvement on average in
success rates. Website: https://pd-perry.github.io/value-flows Code:

Conclusion: FedQS弥合了SAFL中聚合策略之间的差距，为稳定、准确和高效的联邦学习提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
parties without sharing raw data, with semi-asynchronous FL (SAFL) emerging as
a balanced approach between synchronous and asynchronous FL. However, SAFL
faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD)
and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct
trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient
aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from
pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but
slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the
first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL.
FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity
by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their
local training based on data distribution characteristics and available
computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural
language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the
highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in
convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges
the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for
stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning. The code and datasets are

Abstract: In AI-powered e-commerce livestreaming, digital avatars require real-time
responses to drive engagement, a task for which high-latency Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) are ill-suited. We introduce LiveThinking, a practical two-stage
optimization framework to bridge this gap. First, we address computational cost
by distilling a 670B teacher LRM into a lightweight 30B Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) model (3B active) using Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). This
reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning,
causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's
reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing
correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold
reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world
application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and
helpfulness by 21.8%. Tested by hundreds of thousands of viewers, our system
led to a statistically significant increase in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV),
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing user experience and commercial

Motivation: 传统Graph Random Features (GRFs)存在长期限制，包括难以建模远距离节点关系、依赖采样长随机游走效率低下，以及游走终止机制过于简单。

Conclusion: GRFs++通过创新技术解决了传统GRFs的关键限制，在保持无偏性的同时显著提升了计算效率和近似精度。

Abstract: We propose refined GRFs (GRFs++), a new class of Graph Random Features (GRFs)
for efficient and accurate computations involving kernels defined on the nodes
of a graph. GRFs++ resolve some of the long-standing limitations of regular
GRFs, including difficulty modeling relationships between more distant nodes.
They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel
walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking
unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation
quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading
sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of
short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the
simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed
halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general
distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy
of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost. We provide
empirical evaluations to showcase all our claims and complement our results
with theoretical analysis.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) presents an attractive paradigm for
training intelligent agents without expensive online interactions. However,
current approaches still struggle with complex, long-horizon sequential
decision making. In this work, we introduce DEtached value learning with Action
Sequence (DEAS), a simple yet effective offline RL framework that leverages
action sequences for value learning. These temporally extended actions provide
richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the
options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling
reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at
once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms
introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached
value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that
achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS
consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench
and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale
Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly
boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归transformer通过参数重用和隐藏状态迭代来解耦计算深度与参数深度，但在相同计算量下，参数较少的递归模型性能往往落后于非递归模型

Method: 引入Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH)方案，将状态管理外部化到显式内存缓冲区，并使用轻量级路由器动态多样化各迭代的计算

Result: 在Pythia套件(160M-1.4B)上，MeSH增强的递归transformer持续优于递归基线，在1.4B规模上超越其更大的非递归对应模型，平均下游准确率提升+1.06%

Conclusion: MeSH被确立为构建更强递归模型的可扩展和原则性架构，成功解决了计算未分化和信息过载的病理问题

Abstract: Recursive transformers reuse parameters and iterate over hidden states
multiple times, decoupling compute depth from parameter depth. However, under
matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind
non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance
gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is
forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and
information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist
in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a
Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management
into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically
diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that
MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional
specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B),
MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive
baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B
scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer
non-embedding parameters. Our analysis establishes MeSH as a scalable and
principled architecture for building stronger recursive models.

TL;DR: 论文证明t-SNE可视化不能可靠反映输入数据的聚类强度和异常点极端程度，揭示了该方法的两个主要失效模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管t-SNE被广泛使用并被认为能反映输入数据结构，但作者质疑这种假设的可靠性，旨在揭示t-SNE在实际应用中的局限性。

Method: 通过理论证明和实际案例演示，分析t-SNE在反映输入聚类强度和异常点极端程度方面的不可靠性。

Result: 发现t-SNE输出无法可靠推断输入数据的聚类强度和异常点的极端程度，这些失效模式在实践中普遍存在。

Conclusion: t-SNE可视化结果不能准确反映输入数据的真实结构特征，用户需要谨慎解读t-SNE输出结果。

Abstract: Central to the widespread use of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding
(t-SNE) is the conviction that it produces visualizations whose structure
roughly matches that of the input. To the contrary, we prove that (1) the
strength of the input clustering, and (2) the extremity of outlier points,
cannot be reliably inferred from the t-SNE output. We demonstrate the
prevalence of these failure modes in practice as well.

Motivation: 现有图基础模型需要集中访问多领域图数据，但隐私和制度限制使得这不可行。联邦图基础模型解决了这一限制，但需要构建既能实现域内语义一致性又能保持域间多样性的全局代码本。

Method: FedBook采用两阶段过程：1）域内协作：通过参考语义更可靠的高频token来优化低频token；2）域间集成：根据客户端代码本的语义独特性加权聚合，构建全局图基础模型。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，FedBook在多个领域和任务上持续优于21个基线方法，包括孤立监督学习、FL/FGL、集中式GFMs的联邦适应和FedGFM技术。

Conclusion: FedBook通过系统化的联邦预训练过程，成功构建了既能保持域内语义一致性又能保留域间多样性的全局代码本，为联邦图基础模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable cross-domain generalization in
language and vision, inspiring the development of graph foundation models
(GFMs). However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to
multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional
constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this
limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a
robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating
mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining
inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To
this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook
that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side
federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain
Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more
semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance
domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client
contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks
during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain
diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and
tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including
isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized
GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的锐度度量方法——Rényi锐度，基于Rényi熵来衡量损失Hessian矩阵特征值的分布均匀性，并证明其与泛化能力的强相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有锐度度量方法与泛化能力的相关性通常不强，有时甚至很弱。为了弥补直觉与现实之间的差距，需要一种能更好反映泛化能力的锐度度量。

Method: 定义Rényi锐度为损失Hessian矩阵的负Rényi熵，利用Rényi熵简洁地表征Hessian特征值的分布范围。还提出了Rényi锐度感知最小化(RSAM)作为训练正则化方法。

Result: 实验验证了Rényi锐度与泛化能力之间的强相关性（特别是Kendall秩相关）。RSAM方法在所有现有的锐度感知最小化方法中表现最佳，相比经典SAM方法测试准确率提升可达近2.5%。

Conclusion: Rényi锐度是一种有效的泛化能力度量指标，基于此提出的RSAM训练方法显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the
generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the
landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.
Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the
generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap
between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,
i.e., \textit{R\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\'enyi
entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss
Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \textit{uniform}
(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping
the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the
\textit{R\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of
the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller
the (R\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between
generalization and (R\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization
bounds in terms of R\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the
reparametrization invariance property of R\'enyi sharpness, as well as the
trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.
Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong
correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\'enyi
sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\'enyi
Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\'enyi Sharpness Aware
Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware
minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our
proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\%, compared against the
classical SAM method.

Result: 在模拟和真实广告系统实验中显著优于典型基线方法

Conclusion: VAMO方法通过验证集对齐策略有效提升了多任务竞价优化的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 无线联邦学习中，客户端需要通过带宽受限的通道传输高维DNN参数，这导致了通信延迟问题。现有方法为所有DNN层分配相同的调制级别，没有考虑各层的重要性差异。

Method: 提出层自适应调制方案，考虑DNN各层的重要性，自动为不同层决定最优调制级别，提供更多自由度来节省延迟。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有方案相比，该方案可节省高达73.9%的通信延迟。

Conclusion: 层自适应调制方案能有效减少无线联邦学习中的通信延迟，通过考虑DNN层的重要性差异实现更高效的通信。

Abstract: In wireless federated learning (FL), the clients need to transmit the
high-dimensional deep neural network (DNN) parameters through bandwidth-limited
channels, which causes the communication latency issue. In this paper, we
propose a layer-wise adaptive modulation scheme to save the communication
latency. Unlike existing works which assign the same modulation level for all
DNN layers, we consider the layers' importance which provides more freedom to
save the latency. The proposed scheme can automatically decide the optimal
modulation levels for different DNN layers. Experimental results show that the
proposed scheme can save up to 73.9% of communication latency compared with the
existing schemes.

Conclusion: 弱形式方程学习技术能够从高度稀疏的实验数据中学习昆虫种群运动的有效模型，有助于理解和预测害虫行为。

Abstract: Insect species subject to infection, predation, and anisotropic environmental
conditions may exhibit preferential movement patterns. Given the innate
stochasticity of exogenous factors driving these patterns over short
timescales, individual insect trajectories typically obey overdamped stochastic
dynamics. In practice, data-driven modeling approaches designed to learn the
underlying Fokker-Planck equations from observed insect distributions serve as
ideal tools for understanding and predicting such behavior. Understanding
dispersal dynamics of crop and silvicultural pests can lead to a better
forecasting of outbreak intensity and location, which can result in better pest
management. In this work, we extend weak-form equation learning techniques,
coupled with kernel density estimation, to learn effective models for
lepidopteran larval population movement from highly sparse experimental data.
Galerkin methods such as the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear
Dynamics (WSINDy) algorithm have recently proven useful for learning governing
equations in several scientific contexts. We demonstrate the utility of the
method on a sparse dataset of position measurements of fall armyworms
(Spodoptera frugiperda) obtained in simulated agricultural conditions with
varied plant resources and infection status.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法在遗忘敏感信息时往往损害模型的原有能力和知识，需要一种既能有效遗忘又能保持模型效用的方法。

Method: 提出选择性影响机器遗忘(SIMU)框架，通过识别并仅更新编码遗忘集的关键神经元，限制参数更新范围来保护模型原有知识。

Result: SIMU在实现可比遗忘效果的同时，在保持模型原有知识方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 选择性神经元更新策略是平衡遗忘效果与知识保留的有效方法，SIMU框架为机器遗忘提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model
behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that
enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For
machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have
shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information.
However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original
capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior
knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence
Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order
optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons
responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these
targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while
substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original
knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制无法泛化到由未见攻击模板伪装的恶意查询，尽管LLMs能够在嵌入空间中区分这些伪装的恶意查询。

Method: 采用两阶段防御方法：(i)预生成防御在响应生成前检测恶意查询；(ii)生成中防御在生成过程中监控部分响应，防止输出更多有害内容。通过专门提示训练LLM预测查询和部分响应的危害性。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的广泛实验表明，MetaDefense显著优于现有防御机制，对已知和未知攻击模板的恶意查询都能实现鲁棒防御，同时在良性任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MetaDefense通过早期终止潜在有害交互，为LLMs提供了有效的防御机制，能够应对不断演变的越狱攻击策略。

Abstract: This paper introduces MetaDefense, a novel framework for defending against
finetuning-based jailbreak attacks in large language models (LLMs). We observe
that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries
disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of
distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these
insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense
that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii)
mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to
prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to
predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized
prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B,
Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense
significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense
against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining
competitive performance on benign tasks. Code is available at

Conclusion: 测试时自改进算法TT-SI展示了构建更强大智能体实现自我进化的新范式潜力

Abstract: One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large
training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will
enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice,
gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is
prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model
will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing
techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information
or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in
unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement
method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The
proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies
the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates
similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and
(iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning
(self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time
Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training
examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast
this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model
generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using
distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks
demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy
gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning
methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the
promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at
test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward
self-evolution.

Conclusion: MA-GAD框架通过结合图压缩和元学习，有效解决了少样本图级异常检测中的噪声干扰和标注数据稀缺问题，在真实生化数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs or subgraphs
within graph datasets, playing a vital role in various fields such as fraud
detection, review classification, and biochemistry. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have made significant progress in this domain, existing methods rely
heavily on large amounts of labeled data, which is often unavailable in
real-world scenarios. Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on
GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and
reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD),
incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size,
mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We
also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar
networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly
adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection
performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the
distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based
on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under
few-shot conditions. Experiments on both graph anomaly and subgraph anomaly
detection tasks validate the framework's effectiveness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images often suffer from noise
contamination, which degrades image quality and affects further analysis. This
research presents a complete approach to estimate their Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) and noise variance (NV), and enhance image quality using NV-guided Wiener
filter. The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique
and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then
guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and
accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR
estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order
Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order
Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression
(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown
that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines
(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.
In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it
stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these
results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression
Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR
method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided
Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is
shown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and
leads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process.

Conclusion: 基于ELF的三维表示有潜力提高预测准确性，支持临床实践中更安全的组合药物处方

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical
decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI)
between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous
studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures.
Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular
binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI
Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a
novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical
information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density
maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction
risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic
properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure
interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of
drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442
substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a
comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically
significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112),
and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of
ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer
combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

TL;DR: SketchGuard是一个去中心化联邦学习框架，通过草图压缩技术降低拜占庭攻击防御的通信和计算成本，同时保持相同的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拜占庭鲁棒DFL防御方法需要交换和比较完整的高维模型向量，通信和计算成本过高，无法在web规模部署。

Method: 使用Count Sketch将d维模型压缩到k维草图进行相似性比较，仅从接受的邻居处获取完整模型，降低通信复杂度。

Result: 在保持与最先进方法相同鲁棒性的同时，计算时间减少82%，通信开销减少50-70%，且收益随模型维度和网络连接性倍增。

Conclusion: 基于草图压缩的方法是实现web规模鲁棒DFL的基本使能技术。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving
collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to
Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates.
Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor
screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete
high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round,
creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent
deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that
decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based
neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to
$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity
comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,
reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +
d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \le |N_i|$ is the
accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both
strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression
preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where
approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\epsilon))$ factor in the effective
threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets,
network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains
identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation
time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering
effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality
and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based
compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SNN时间特性的自蒸馏方法，将SNN自然解构为多个子模型，通过强子模型指导弱子模型或弱子模型反向蒸馏强子模型，有效提升SNN性能和对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN性能与ANN存在差距，传统知识蒸馏方法依赖大教师模型或引入额外训练开销。本文旨在利用SNN的时间特性实现高效自蒸馏。

Method: 将SNN每个时间步实例视为子模型，评估其输出置信度识别强弱关系，提出Strong2Weak和Weak2Strong两种自蒸馏方案，支持集成、同步和级联蒸馏实现。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效提升SNN的判别能力和整体性能，同时增强对抗鲁棒性，受益于自蒸馏带来的稳定性。

Conclusion: 巧妙利用SNN的时间特性，为高效训练高性能SNN提供了新思路。

Abstract: Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise to be a low-power
alternative to computationally intensive artificial neural networks (ANNs),
although performance gaps persist. Recent studies have improved the performance
of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or
introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be
naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient
self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and
evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the
weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient
self-distillation schemes: (1) \textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the
stronger "teacher" guides the weaker "student", effectively improving overall
performance. (2) \textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the "teacher",
distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding
significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible
implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation.
Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and
overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also
enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This
ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into
how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.

TL;DR: DISCO提出了一种新的模型评估方法，通过选择模型响应差异最大的样本来替代传统基于聚类的锚点子集选择，显著降低了评估成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型评估成本过高，传统基准测试需要数千GPU小时，这降低了包容性、减缓创新周期并加剧环境影响。

Method: DISCO方法选择模型响应差异最大的前k个样本，使用贪婪的样本级统计而非全局聚类，理论证明模型间分歧提供了信息论最优的选择规则。

Result: DISCO在MMLU、Hellaswag、Winogrande和ARC等基准测试中实现了最先进的性能预测结果。

Conclusion: 通过最大化模型响应多样性而非样本多样性，DISCO提供了一种概念更简单、效果更好的低成本模型评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating modern machine learning models has become prohibitively expensive.
Benchmarks such as LMMs-Eval and HELM demand thousands of GPU hours per model.
Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and
worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First,
select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on
this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection
depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We
argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is
to select samples that $\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our
method, $\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k
samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise
statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler.
From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an
information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection.
$\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag,
Winogrande, and ARC. Code is available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞扰动预测中，预测新基因扰动效果时需要考虑两种不确定性：模型不确定性和数据不确定性，这对评估预测可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用多变量深度证据回归框架，联合估计两种不确定性来源，为每个预测生成置信度分数。

Result: PRESCRIBE能有效估计预测置信度，与经验准确率强相关，相比基线方法实现了超过3%的稳定准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别不可靠预测结果，提高单细胞扰动预测的可靠性，为生物医学研究提供更可信的预测工具。

Abstract: In single-cell perturbation prediction, a central task is to forecast the
effects of perturbing a gene unseen in the training data. The efficacy of such
predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to
those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic)
uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which
reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for
determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation
is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose
PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a
multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both
sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE
effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly
correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering
of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy
improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体强化学习框架，集成高效的气候代理模型来替代计算昂贵的气候模拟器，实现多气体动态下的区域气候政策学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候政策研究需要能捕捉多种温室气体对全球温度综合影响的模型，但这些模型计算成本高昂，难以嵌入强化学习。

Method: 使用预训练的循环神经网络架构作为气候模型CICERO-SCM的代理，该模型在20000条多气体排放路径上训练，实现近模拟器精度和1000倍加速的单步推理。

Result: 代理模型达到全球平均温度RMSE≈0.0004K的精度，在气候政策MARL设置中替代原始模拟器，端到端训练加速超过100倍，且与模拟器收敛到相同最优策略。

Conclusion: 该方法绕过了核心计算瓶颈而不牺牲策略保真度，使得在多气体动态和高保真气候响应下进行大规模多智能体气候政策实验成为可能。

Abstract: Climate policy studies require models that capture the combined effects of
multiple greenhouse gases on global temperature, but these models are
computationally expensive and difficult to embed in reinforcement learning. We
present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a
high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment
loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas
dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network
architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to
surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains
near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\approx 0.0004
\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\times$ faster one-step inference. When
substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it
accelerates end-to-end training by $>\!100\times$. We show that the surrogate
and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology
to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our
work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing
policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across
alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity
climate response.

TL;DR: 本文通过稳定性分析推导了多八卦步骤(MGS)的泛化误差和超额误差上界，系统回答了MGS为何有效以及能否完全消除去中心化与中心化训练之间性能差距的关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化训练虽然通信效率高，但性能通常低于中心化训练。MGS作为桥梁能显著缩小这一差距，但其理论有效性和能否完全消除差距仍是未解问题。

Method: 使用稳定性分析推导MGS的泛化误差和超额误差上界，分析学习率、数据异构性、节点数量、样本大小和通信拓扑等因素对MGS泛化的影响。

Result: 1) MGS以指数速率减少优化误差，从而指数级收紧泛化误差界；2) 即使MGS趋于无穷，去中心化与中心化训练之间仍存在不可忽略的泛化误差差距；3) 在CIFAR数据集上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: MGS能显著改善去中心化训练性能，但无法完全消除与中心化训练的差距，为去中心化训练提供了重要的理论指导和统一分析框架。

Abstract: Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a
communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training
efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to
centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective
bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing
experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its
effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open
questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error
and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering
these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the
optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially
tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better
solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a
non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized
mini-batch SGD ($\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{c\beta}{c\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in
centralized and $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2c\beta}{2c\beta +2}}/{n
m^{\frac{1}{2c\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the
first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,
node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the
generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients
assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.
Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical
findings.

*Kazuki Egashira,Robin Staab,Thibaud Gloaguen,Mark Vero,Martin Vechev*

TL;DR: 本文首次揭示了现代LLM剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全漏洞，攻击者可以构建看似良性的模型，但在剪枝后表现出恶意行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型剪枝已成为减少大语言模型推理时内存占用的重要方法，但其安全影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究剪枝方法可能被恶意利用的安全风险。

Method: 攻击者首先计算每个参数被剪枝可能性的代理指标，然后将恶意行为注入到不太可能被剪枝的参数中，最后使用可能被剪枝的参数修复模型，从而在未剪枝模型中抵消注入的行为。

Result: 在五个模型上的广泛评估显示，经过vLLM中的任意剪枝方法（Magnitude、Wanda和SparseGPT）处理后，模型在多种攻击场景中持续表现出强烈的恶意行为（越狱成功率高达95.7%，良性指令拒绝率98.7%，目标内容注入成功率99.5%）。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了关键部署时安全漏洞，强调了在模型压缩中需要更强的安全意识。

Abstract: Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a
prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models
(LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM,
enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed.
While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved
significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In
this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be
maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that
appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is
based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates
how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary
can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely
to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are
likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the
unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive
evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied
(Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious
behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\%$
for jailbreak, $98.7\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\%$ for
targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time
security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in
model compression.

Result: 扩展到70B参数和超过1T训练tokens的模型，在相同额外计算预算下比从头训练获得10.66%准确率提升。

Conclusion: 检查点回收方法为经济高效的大语言模型预训练奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapidly increasing computational cost of pretraining Large Language
Models necessitates more efficient approaches. Numerous computational costs
have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them
remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity.
To efficiently reuse this "sunk" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained
checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We
propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts
model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication
with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such
growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling
experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation
with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to
better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and
over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from
scratch under the same additional compute budget. Our checkpoint recycling
approach establishes a foundation for economically efficient large language
model pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出了DUA-D2C方法，通过动态不确定性感知的聚合机制改进Divide2Conquer方法，有效对抗深度学习的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中的过拟合问题，特别是针对数据异常值、噪声和有限训练数据的情况。传统D2C方法的聚合过程未能充分利用子集模型的不同泛化能力。

Method: 在D2C基础上，引入动态不确定性感知聚合机制，基于共享验证集上的性能和预测不确定性来动态加权子集模型的贡献。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上的实证评估表明，DUA-D2C显著改善了泛化性能，即使在其他正则化方法之上应用也能提升性能。

Conclusion: DUA-D2C是一个理论上有依据且有效的方法，能够有效对抗现代深度学习中的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising
from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the
Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training
data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.
This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the
influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation
typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like
data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying
generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce
Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that
refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions
of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,
considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent
aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets
yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively
combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning
multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves
generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss
curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of
DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization
performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,
establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating
overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at:

Motivation: 解决现有个性化PageRank计算效率问题，特别是当精度要求高时传统方法复杂度与图规模相关，希望实现与图规模无关的高效算法

Method: 使用嵌套演化集过程框架，在每个阶段采用局部化近似近端点迭代求解简化线性系统，仅需求解约$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$个线性系统

Result: 时间复杂度上界为$\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$，当$1/\epsilon^2\ll m$时，总体复杂度为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2))$，与图规模无关

Conclusion: 该框架显著加速了PPR计算，解决了现有文献中的开放猜想，实验验证了早期阶段的高效收敛性能

Abstract: This work proposes a novel framework based on nested evolving set processes
to accelerate Personalized PageRank (PPR) computation. At each stage of the
process, we employ a localized inexact proximal point iteration to solve a
simplified linear system. We show that the time complexity of such localized
methods is upper bounded by $\min\{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(R^2/\epsilon^2),
\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(m)\}$ to obtain an $\epsilon$-approximation of the PPR
vector, where $m$ denotes the number of edges in the graph and $R$ is a
constant defined via nested evolving set processes. Furthermore, the algorithms
induced by our framework require solving only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\alpha})$ such linear systems, where $\alpha$ is
the damping factor. When $1/\epsilon^2\ll m$, this implies the existence of an
algorithm that computes an $\ epsilon $-approximation of the PPR vector with an
overall time complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(R^2 /
(\sqrt{\alpha}\epsilon^2)\right)$, independent of the underlying graph size.
Our result resolves an open conjecture from existing literature. Experimental
results on real-world graphs validate the efficiency of our methods,
demonstrating significant convergence in the early stages.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and
localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically
require costly calibration processes to collect location-labeled channel state
information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection
trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need
for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model
(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,
while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The
primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel
propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical
locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that
jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of
the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is
modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models
for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a
Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility
model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental
validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration
demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy
of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions.
Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error
compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN),
support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).

Motivation: 模型合并技术虽然有效，但存在严重的安全风险，特别是对后门攻击高度脆弱。现有研究显示，通过在单个微调模型中植入隐藏触发器，攻击者可以控制最终合并模型的输出。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了模型合并中后门威胁的核心漏洞——利用基础模型中对抗性弱点的固有触发器，并提出了有效的攻击和防御框架，为理解和管理模型合并安全风险提供了新视角。

Abstract: Model merging (MM) recently emerged as an effective method for combining
large deep learning models. However, it poses significant security risks.
Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which
introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows
the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference
time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor
attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\ Vector\
(BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned
backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into
attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their
similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that
enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\ Backdoor\ Vector\
(SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core
vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\ triggers$ that exploit
adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose
$Injection\ BV\ Subtraction\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against
backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the
first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same
time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even
when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.

*Akira Ito,Masanori Yamada,Daiki Chijiwa,Atsutoshi Kumagai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，仅通过增加模型宽度（无需参数置换）结合合适的softmax温度校准，即可实现线性模式连接（LMC）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究认为实现LMC需要参数置换搜索和足够宽的模型，本文旨在验证仅通过模型宽度扩展是否足以实现LMC。

Method: 引入层间指数加权连接性（LEWC）分析中间层输出，使用softmax温度校准，证明合并模型输出可表示为原始模型输出的指数加权和。

Result: 实验证明仅通过模型宽度扩展即可实现LMC，无需参数置换，且合并模型输出相当于原始模型的集成。

Conclusion: 模型宽度扩展不仅促进非线性模式连接，也显著提高实现线性模式连接的可能性。

Abstract: Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two
independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves
the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss
linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear
mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have
reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search
but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\times$ width multiplier for
ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width
ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance
of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,
even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for
achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further
explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.
Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity
(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be
represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the
corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's
output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates
LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening
the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in
prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving
linear mode connectivity.

*Gunjun Lee,Jiwon Kim,Jaiyoung Park,Younjoo Lee,Jung Ho Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出layered prefill调度方法，通过按层组调度替代分块预填充，消除MoE模型中的权重重复加载，显著降低延迟和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分块预填充调度在MoE模型中导致专家权重重复加载，增加内存流量和能耗，需要更高效的调度方法。

Method: 将transformer模型垂直划分为连续层组，在层组间交错执行预填充和解码操作，避免分块导致的MoE权重重载。

Result: 降低片外带宽需求，TTFT减少70%，端到端延迟降低41%，每token能耗降低22%，改善TTFT-TBT帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 从token轴转向层轴调度，为共置环境下的高效节能LLM服务开辟了新操作机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference in production must meet stringent
service-level objectives for both time-to-first-token (TTFT) and
time-between-token (TBT) while maximizing throughput under fixed compute,
memory, and interconnect budgets. Modern serving systems adopt stall-free
scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt
processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing
decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs
substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert
weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy
consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats
transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically
partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill
and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding
while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip
bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and
per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill
consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill,
reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free
decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a
new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in
co-located environments.

*Timon Klein,Piotr Minakowski,Sebastian Sager*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Subject-Conditioned Layer来解决EEG解码中的受试者特异性分布偏移问题，通过分解权重为共享组件和个性化低秩校正，使现有模型对受试者变化具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受试者特异性分布偏移是EEG解码基础模型发展的重要障碍，需要解决跨受试者的适应性问题。

Method: 设计Subject-Conditioned Layer作为标准线性或卷积层的替代，将权重分解为共享的受试者不变组件和轻量级的低秩校正，每个受试者都有独特的校正项。

Result: 配备该层的模型在性能上优于仅使用共享权重的模型和单独训练的受试者特定模型的平均值。

Conclusion: Subject-Conditioned Layer为构建有效的跨受试者EEG基础模型提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Subject-specific distribution shifts represent an important obstacle to the
development of foundation models for EEG decoding. To address this, we propose
Subject-Conditioned Layer,, an adaptive layer designed as a drop-in replacement
for standard linear or convolutional layers in any neural network architecture.
Our layer captures subject-specific variability by decomposing its weights into
a shared, subject-invariant component and a lightweight, low-rank correction
unique to each subject. This explicit separation of general knowledge from
personalized adaptation allows existing models to become robust to subject
shifts. Empirically, models equipped with our layer outperform both a
shared-weight-only model (subject-agnostic model) and the average of
individually trained subject-specific models. Consequently, the
Subject-Conditioned Layer, offers a practical and scalable path towards
building effective cross-subject foundation models for EEG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了学习智能体如何最优地整合专家数据的问题，提出了在贝叶斯多臂老虎机框架下处理离线专家数据和同时学习场景的方法，并开发了信息理论算法来量化专家数据的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着复杂学习智能体越来越多地与现有专家（如人类操作员或预训练智能体）共同部署，需要明确如何最优地整合与学习者自身经验结构不同的专家数据。

Method: 在贝叶斯多臂老虎机框架下研究两种设置：(i)离线设置：学习者在交互前接收专家最优策略的结果数据集；(ii)同时设置：学习者在每一步选择基于自身经验或专家同时获得的结果更新信念。提出了信息导向规则，让学习者处理能最大化关于最优动作一步信息增益的数据源。

Result: 证明了在专家结果上预训练可以通过专家数据与最优动作之间的互信息来收紧信息理论遗憾界。提出了学习者推断何时信任专家、何时不信任的策略，保护学习者免受专家无效或被破坏的情况。

Conclusion: 通过量化专家数据的价值，该框架为智能体智能地决定何时向他人学习提供了实用的信息理论算法。

Abstract: Complex learning agents are increasingly deployed alongside existing experts,
such as human operators or previously trained agents. However, it remains
unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data,
which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome
experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed
bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a
dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and
(ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether
to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome
simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences
the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens
information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the
expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an
information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that
maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we
propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and
when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is
ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our
framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to
intelligently decide when to learn from others.

*Kodai Kawamura,Yuta Goto,Rintaro Yanagi,Hirokatsu Kataoka,Go Irie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了近似领域遗忘(ADU)的新问题设置，旨在让预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)在保持其他领域识别准确性的同时，降低对指定领域图像的识别准确率，以解决传统类别遗忘在实际应用中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型虽然具有强大的泛化能力，但往往保留了下游任务不需要的冗余信息，可能带来计算效率问题和信息泄露风险。传统类别遗忘方法在实际应用中存在局限性，比如自动驾驶系统需要准确识别真实汽车，但不应将广告中的插图汽车误认为真实汽车。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过显式解耦领域分布并自适应捕获实例特定的领域信息，来解决预训练VLMs中领域分布高度纠缠的技术挑战。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在基于VLM调优技术构建的基线方法上表现更优，为VLMs中实用和细粒度的遗忘铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 近似领域遗忘(ADU)为视觉语言模型提供了更实用和细粒度的知识遗忘方案，能够有效解决领域间分布纠缠的问题，在保持模型整体性能的同时实现特定领域知识的精确遗忘。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization
capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse
domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant
information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising
concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This
has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to
selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model
performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily
focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize
specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely
forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For
instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars
while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside
advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we
introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that
requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,
illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU
presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization
capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in
the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains
ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that
explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures
instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our
approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way
for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了AEPO方法解决强化学习微调中的熵崩溃问题，通过温度调节实现精确的熵控制，揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习微调方法如GRPO存在熵崩溃问题，导致探索消失和策略过早收敛，现有熵正则化方法只能部分缓解问题且引入偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出AEPO方法，用温度调整分布上的REINFORCE策略梯度替代熵奖励，通过温度调节稳定熵值，包含策略梯度正则化、分布正则化和REINFORCE正则化三个关键设计。

Result: AEPO能够稳定熵值在任意目标水平，有效消除GRPO中的熵崩溃；揭示了熵与性能的非单调关系；提供了更广泛的RFT范式。

Conclusion: AEPO解决了熵崩溃问题，阐明了熵、探索和推理性能之间的关系，并为强化学习微调提供了更通用的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is essential for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLM), yet the widely adopted Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from entropy collapse, where
entropy monotonically decreases, exploration vanishes, and policies converge
prematurely. Existing entropy-regularized methods only partially alleviate this
issue while introducing bias and instability, leaving entropy control
unresolved and the connection between entropy, exploration, and performance
unclear. We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy
gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through
temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as
regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as
regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting
optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1)
stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in
GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves
then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy,
exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a
broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE
regularizers.

TL;DR: 提出基于香农熵的置信度框架，通过token级logprobs实现早期停止，在保持任务准确性的同时节省25-50%计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用推理模型中的熵作为置信信号，发现高级推理模型在获得正确答案时具有早期认知能力，可减少token使用和延迟。

Method: 使用token级logprobs计算香农熵作为置信信号，通过一次性计算的熵阈值实现早期停止推理。

Result: 在推理优化模型系列中实现25-50%计算成本减少，同时保持准确性，表明置信机制是现代后训练推理系统的区分特征。

Conclusion: 熵基置信度校准是高级后训练优化模型的新兴特性，可有效利用模型早期认知能力提升推理效率。

Abstract: We introduce a simple, yet novel entropy-based framework to drive token
efficiency in large language models during reasoning tasks. Our approach uses
Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable
early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task
accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration
represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present
in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and
pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop
reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot
using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results
indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a
correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be
exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates
consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50%
computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that
confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern
post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.

TL;DR: GALA是一个可扩展的联邦无监督多源域自适应框架，通过组间差异最小化和温度控制加权策略，解决了多源域自适应中的计算复杂性和性能不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式无监督多源域自适应方法假设源域数量较少，无法有效扩展到大量异构域，导致计算开销高或性能不稳定。

Method: 提出GALA框架，包含：(1)组间差异最小化目标，无需二次计算即可近似全对域对齐；(2)温度控制的质心加权策略，根据与目标域的对齐程度动态优先处理源域。

Result: 在标准基准测试中取得竞争性或最优结果，在多样化多源设置中显著优于现有方法，特别是在其他方法无法收敛的情况下。

Conclusion: GALA提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，能够在大规模异构源域设置下实现稳定和可并行化训练。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims to learn models that
generalize to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging labeled data from
multiple, diverse source domains. While distributed UMDA methods address
privacy constraints by avoiding raw data sharing, existing approaches typically
assume a small number of sources and fail to scale effectively. Increasing the
number of heterogeneous domains often makes existing methods impractical,
leading to high computational overhead or unstable performance. We propose
GALA, a scalable and robust federated UMDA framework that introduces two key
components: (1) a novel inter-group discrepancy minimization objective that
efficiently approximates full pairwise domain alignment without quadratic
computation; and (2) a temperature-controlled, centroid-based weighting
strategy that dynamically prioritizes source domains based on alignment with
the target. Together, these components enable stable and parallelizable
training across large numbers of heterogeneous sources. To evaluate performance
in high-diversity scenarios, we introduce Digit-18, a new benchmark comprising
18 digit datasets with varied synthetic and real-world domain shifts. Extensive
experiments show that GALA consistently achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks and significantly outperforms
prior methods in diverse multi-source settings where others fail to converge.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波技术提供了更精细的空间分辨率，但其在人员识别方面的相对优势尚未被探索，需要与sub-6 GHz频段进行公平比较。

Method: 使用商用Wi-Fi设备收集同步的sub-6 GHz和毫米波频段室内测量数据，采用相同的训练流程和模型配置，利用端到端深度学习和有效的背景减除技术。

Result: 在低采样率（10 Hz）下，毫米波Wi-Fi信号结合背景减除技术，在20个人的识别任务中达到了91.2%的准确率。

Abstract: Person identification plays a vital role in enabling intelligent,
personalized, and secure human-computer interaction. Recent research has
demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging Wi-Fi signals for passive person
identification using a person's unique gait pattern. Although most existing
work focuses on sub-6 GHz frequencies, the emergence of mmWave offers new
opportunities through its finer spatial resolution, though its comparative
advantages for person identification remain unexplored. This work presents the
first comparative study between sub-6 GHz and mmWave Wi-Fi signals for person
identification with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Wi-Fi, using a novel
dataset of synchronized measurements from the two frequency bands in an indoor
environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we apply identical training pipelines
and model configurations across both frequency bands. Leveraging end-to-end
deep learning, we show that even at low sampling rates (10 Hz), mmWave Wi-Fi
signals can achieve high identification accuracy (91.2% on 20 individuals) when
combined with effective background subtraction.

Conclusion: 该研究推进了生物序列建模技术，为增强自回归模型的双向理解能力提供了一种新颖的架构范式，适用于复杂序列生成任务。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.

TL;DR: 提出MORE框架，通过直接重新平衡模型参数空间来解决长尾识别问题，使用低秩参数组件和正弦重加权调度，不增加模型复杂度或推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长尾识别在深度学习和基础模型微调中普遍存在且具有挑战性，偏斜的类别分布阻碍了模型对尾部类别的泛化能力。现有方法在如多标签长尾识别等广泛场景中难以实现一致改进。

Method: 提出模型再平衡(MORE)框架，引入低秩参数组件来调节参数空间分配，通过定制损失和正弦重加权调度进行指导，但不增加整体模型复杂度或推理成本。

Result: 在多样化的长尾基准测试（包括多类和多标签任务）上的广泛实验表明，MORE显著提高了泛化能力，特别是对尾部类别，并能有效补充现有的不平衡缓解方法。

Conclusion: MORE有潜力成为长尾设置中的鲁棒即插即用模块，通过直接重新平衡模型参数空间来缓解不平衡问题。

Abstract: Long-tailed recognition is ubiquitous and challenging in deep learning and
even in the downstream finetuning of foundation models, since the skew class
distribution generally prevents the model generalization to the tail classes.
Despite the promise of previous methods from the perspectives of data
augmentation, loss rebalancing and decoupled training etc., consistent
improvement in the broad scenarios like multi-label long-tailed recognition is
difficult. In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact
under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing
(MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter
space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate
the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal
reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or
inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks,
spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly
improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively
complements existing imbalance mitigation methods. These results highlight
MORE's potential as a robust plug-and-play module in long-tailed settings.

Conclusion: 通过协同利用专门处理单一问题的'弱'辅助模型，可以有效地解决类别不平衡和标签噪声的共存挑战，D-SINK框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring
challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance.
While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial,
as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often
leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel
perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from
scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually
'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or
label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class
imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level
concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness
mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without
conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel
framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating
complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models.
Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label
allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a
noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust
one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK
significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in
learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors
due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental
sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for
further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous
methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of
modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce
and release a new dataset
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational
and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark
covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the
application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the
TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results
demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the
feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating
environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines
relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques,
highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning
capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context
improves accuracy.

Motivation: 离线RL在机器人领域应用受限，主要因为缺乏可扩展性。现有方法依赖BPTT（计算昂贵）或策略蒸馏（引入复合误差），需要开发不依赖这两种方法的可扩展离线RL方法。

Method: EVOR结合表达性策略和表达性价值函数，通过流匹配训练正则化的最优Q函数，在推理时使用拒绝采样进行策略提取，实现高效优化和计算可扩展搜索。

Result: 实验表明EVOR在多样化离线RL任务上优于基线方法，证明了表达性价值学习在离线RL中的优势。

Conclusion: EVOR提供了一种无需蒸馏或BPTT的可扩展离线RL解决方案，通过表达性价值学习显著提升了离线RL性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.

*Wiktor Jan Hoffmann,Sonia Laguna,Moritz Vandenhirtz,Emanuele Palumbo,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了后验随机概念瓶颈模型(PSCBMs)，通过在预训练CBM上添加小型协方差预测模块来建模概念间依赖关系，无需重新训练主干模型，显著提升了干预性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模概念依赖关系的方法通常需要重新训练整个模型，这在原始数据或计算资源有限时不可行。

Method: 在预训练CBM基础上添加小型协方差预测模块，构建概念的多变量正态分布，提出两种训练策略。

Result: PSCBMs在测试时概念和目标准确率均优于标准CBM，在干预情况下表现显著更好，且比从头训练类似随机模型更高效。

Conclusion: PSCBMs是一种轻量级方法，能够有效建模概念依赖关系，提升模型性能和干预效果，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are interpretable models that predict the
target variable through high-level human-understandable concepts, allowing
users to intervene on mispredicted concepts to adjust the final output. While
recent work has shown that modeling dependencies between concepts can improve
CBM performance, especially under interventions, such approaches typically
require retraining the entire model, which may be infeasible when access to the
original data or compute is limited. In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc
Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that
augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over
concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without
retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on
real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and
target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due
to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs
under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a
similar stochastic model from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了不确定性感知马尔可夫决策过程（UAMDP）框架，结合贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束，在波动性环境中实现更安全的顺序决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在波动性高、风险大的顺序决策环境中，仅最大化期望收益是不够的，需要系统性的不确定性管理方法。

Method: UAMDP框架将贝叶斯预测、后验采样强化学习和条件风险价值约束相结合，在闭环中更新潜在动态信念，通过Thompson采样生成可能未来，并在预设风险容忍度下优化策略。

Result: 在股票高频交易和零售库存控制两个领域中，UAMDP相比强深度学习基线：长期预测准确率显著提升（RMSE降低25%，sMAPE降低32%），交易夏普比率从1.54提升至1.74，最大回撤减半。

Conclusion: 整合校准概率建模、与后验不确定性对齐的探索和风险感知控制，能够产生稳健、可泛化的方法，实现更安全、更有利可图的顺序决策。

Abstract: Sequential decisions in volatile, high-stakes settings require more than
maximizing expected return; they require principled uncertainty management.
This paper presents the Uncertainty-Aware Markov Decision Process (UAMDP), a
unified framework that couples Bayesian forecasting, posterior-sampling
reinforcement learning, and planning under a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)
constraint. In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent
dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes
policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that
converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions.
We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail
inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic
volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves
long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\% and sMAPE by
32\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe
ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved. These
results show that integrating calibrated probabilistic modeling, exploration
aligned with posterior uncertainty, and risk-aware control yields a robust,
generalizable approach to safer and more profitable sequential decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DMPO（分布匹配策略优化），一种专门为扩散大语言模型设计的强化学习微调方法，通过交叉熵优化匹配策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布，显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归大语言模型的有前景替代方案，具有更高的推理吞吐量潜力，但需要专门的强化学习算法来达到可比的推理性能。

Method: DMPO通过分布匹配框架，使用交叉熵优化将dLLM策略分布与最优奖励倾斜分布对齐，并针对小批量训练挑战提出了权重基线减法等有效解决方案。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中表现出色，无需监督微调即可实现高达42.9%相对于之前SOTA基线的准确率提升，以及55.8%相对于基础模型的提升。

Conclusion: DMPO证明了分布匹配框架在增强扩散大语言模型推理能力方面的有效性，为dLLMs的强化学习微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are promising alternatives to
autoregressive large language models (AR-LLMs), as they potentially allow
higher inference throughput. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a crucial component
for dLLMs to achieve comparable performance with AR-LLMs on important tasks,
such as reasoning. However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs'
unique characteristics have yet to be developed. This paper proposes
Distribution Matching Policy Optimization (DMPO), a principled and
theoretically grounded RL fine-tuning method specifically designed to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of dLLMs by matching the dLLM policy distribution to
the optimal, reward-tilted one through cross-entropy optimization. We identify
a key challenge in the implementation with a small training batch size and
propose several effective solutions through a novel weight baseline subtraction
technique. DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks
without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\%$
over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\%$ over the base model, underscoring
the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework. Our code is available

TL;DR: 该研究使用政治罗盘测试评估了8个主流大语言模型的政治偏见和刻板印象传播，发现所有模型都呈现一致的左倾政治倾向，且通过语言变化引发的隐性刻板印象比显性刻板印象更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在信息传播和决策过程中的作用日益重要，理解其政治偏见对于防止对公众舆论和民主进程产生不当影响至关重要。

Method: 使用二维政治罗盘测试评估模型的固有政治倾向，通过角色提示探索显性刻板印象，使用多语言版本PCT揭示隐性刻板印象。

Result: 所有模型都显示一致的左倾政治倾向；不同模型的刻板印象性质和程度差异很大；隐性刻板印象比显性更明显；大多数模型的隐性和显性刻板印象存在显著一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLMs中政治偏见和刻板印象的复杂相互作用，表明模型对其固有偏见具有一定程度的透明度或"意识"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information
dissemination and decision-making processes. Given their growing societal
influence, understanding potential biases, particularly within the political
domain, is crucial to prevent undue influence on public opinion and democratic
processes. This work investigates political bias and stereotype propagation
across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test
(PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the inherent political leanings
of these models. Subsequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to
explore explicit stereotypes across various social dimensions. In a final step,
implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating models with multilingual
versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning political
alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and
extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes
elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those identified
via explicit persona prompting. Interestingly, for most models, implicit and
explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggesting a degree of
transparency or "awareness" regarding their inherent biases. This study
underscores the complex interplay of political bias and stereotypes in LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于LLM的智能体中的对手塑造问题，提出了ShapeLLM方法，证明LLM智能体能够在竞争性和合作性游戏中影响对手的学习动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实世界环境中的部署增多，多智能体交互不可避免，需要理解这类系统中的策略行为。核心问题是LLM智能体是否能够像强化学习智能体一样，仅通过交互来塑造学习动态并影响其他智能体的行为。

Method: 提出了ShapeLLM方法，这是针对基于transformer的智能体的模型无关对手塑造方法的适配版本，解决了现有OS算法无法直接应用于LLM的问题。

Result: 实验证明LLM智能体能够在竞争性游戏（重复囚徒困境、匹配硬币和胆小鬼游戏）中成功引导对手走向可被利用的均衡，在合作性游戏（重复猎鹿游戏和合作版囚徒困境）中促进协调并提高集体福利。

Conclusion: LLM智能体能够通过交互相互塑造，确立了对手塑造作为多智能体LLM研究的关键维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous
agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent
interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic
behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like
reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence
the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the
first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS
algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order
derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural
components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce
ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based
agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players'
learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate
that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria
in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and
Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative
games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma).
Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through
interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent
LLM research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mix- and MoE-DPO框架通过软混合模型和专家混合架构扩展DPO，使用随机变分推理方法学习专业化专家策略，提升多任务表达能力和异构偏好适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖单一模型，限制了在多任务设置中的表达能力和对异构偏好分布的适应性。

Method: 引入潜在变量模型和变分证据下界优化，支持共享基础架构和独立专家模型，实现输入相关的软门控机制。

Result: 在多种模型规模和多偏好数据集上验证，证明该方法提供了强大且可扩展的偏好对齐解决方案。

Conclusion: Mix- and MoE-DPO为基于偏好的LLM对齐提供了更灵活和可扩展的方法，支持参数效率和专业化之间的权衡。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently emerged as a simple and
effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with user preferences. However, existing
DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their
expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or
diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a
framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our
method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes
a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient
learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO
provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via
universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy
specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes;
and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables
user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base
architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert
models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and
specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and
multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a
powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文解决了从观测数据中识别高维多元结果反事实的开放性问题，建立了使用连续时间流进行多元反事实识别的基础，包括非马尔可夫设置下的标准准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pearl(2000)认为反事实必须可识别才能证明因果主张的有效性。现有反事实推理工作缺乏识别性，削弱了其估计的因果有效性。

Method: 使用连续时间流匹配方法，结合动态最优传输工具，构建唯一、单调且保持秩的反事实传输映射。

Result: 在具有反事实真实值的受控场景中验证了理论，并在真实图像上展示了公理化反事实合理性的改进。

Conclusion: 为高维多元结果的反事实识别建立了理论基础，确保了反事实推理的一致性和因果有效性。

Abstract: We address the open question of counterfactual identification for
high-dimensional multivariate outcomes from observational data. Pearl (2000)
argues that counterfactuals must be identifiable (i.e., recoverable from the
observed data distribution) to justify causal claims. A recent line of work on
counterfactual inference shows promising results but lacks identification,
undermining the causal validity of its estimates. To address this, we establish
a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using
continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard
criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a
unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools
from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference. Building on
this, we validate the theory in controlled scenarios with counterfactual
ground-truth and demonstrate improvements in axiomatic counterfactual soundness
on real images.

<details>

Motivation: 传统时间序列生成方法往往忽略领域特定的物理约束，限制了统计和物理一致性。

Method: 结合傅里叶神经算子学习物理算子，条件流匹配进行概率生成，通过时间依赖的分层约束和FNO引导的校正进行集成。

Result: 在谐波振荡器、人类活动识别和锂离子电池退化实验中，生成质量提高16.3%，物理违规减少46%，预测精度提升18.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理信息归纳偏置的新范式，显著提升了时间序列生成的物理一致性和预测性能。

Abstract: Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%
higher generation quality, 46% fewer physics violations, and 18.5% improved
predictive accuracy over baselines.

Motivation: 随着AI成为6G网络控制的核心组件，AI模型需要适应不断变化的环境条件，包括多供应商部署、硬件升级和服务需求演进带来的新特征和测量指标。

Method: 采用自适应随机森林(ARFs)进行迭代训练以实现动态特征适应，并提出漂移感知特征重要性(DAFI)方法，通过分布漂移检测器来决定何时应用计算密集的特征重要性方法。

Result: 在3个不同数据集上的测试表明，ARFs能够实现稳定的预测，准确率随时间推移而提高；DAFI方法可将运行时间减少至多2倍，同时产生更一致的特征重要性值。

Conclusion: ARFs和DAFI共同提供了一个有前景的框架，用于构建适应6G网络用例的灵活AI方法。

Abstract: As AI becomes a native component of 6G network control, AI models must adapt
to continuously changing conditions, including the introduction of new features
and measurements driven by multi-vendor deployments, hardware upgrades, and
evolving service requirements. To address this growing need for flexible
learning in non-stationary environments, this vision paper highlights Adaptive
Random Forests (ARFs) as a reliable solution for dynamic feature adaptation in
communication network scenarios. We show that iterative training of ARFs can
effectively lead to stable predictions, with accuracy improving over time as
more features are added. In addition, we highlight the importance of
explainability in AI-driven networks, proposing Drift-Aware Feature Importance
(DAFI) as an efficient XAI feature importance (FI) method. DAFI uses a
distributional drift detector to signal when to apply computationally intensive
FI methods instead of lighter alternatives. Our tests on 3 different datasets
indicate that our approach reduces runtime by up to 2 times, while producing
more consistent feature importance values. Together, ARFs and DAFI provide a
promising framework to build flexible AI methods adapted to 6G network
use-cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有容忍对抗行为的协作学习方法要么依赖中央服务器，要么产生高通信成本，需要一种既去中心化又高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用拉取式流行病传播策略，节点从小型随机节点子集拉取模型参数，显著减少消息数量而不影响收敛保证。

Result: 实证结果表明RPEL在对抗环境中保持鲁棒性，达到全对全通信的精度水平，并在大规模网络中高效扩展。

Conclusion: RPEL提供了一种可扩展的去中心化协作学习方案，在保持鲁棒性的同时显著降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning is challenged by training-time adversarial
behaviors. Existing approaches to tolerate such behaviors either rely on a
central server or induce high communication costs. We propose Robust Pull-based
Epidemic Learning (RPEL), a novel, scalable collaborative approach to ensure
robust learning despite adversaries. RPEL does not rely on any central server
and, unlike traditional methods, where communication costs grow in
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ with the number of nodes $n$, RPEL employs a pull-based
epidemic-based communication strategy that scales in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$.
By pulling model parameters from small random subsets of nodes, RPEL
significantly lowers the number of required messages without compromising
convergence guarantees, which hold with high probability. Empirical results
demonstrate that RPEL maintains robustness in adversarial settings, competes
with all-to-all communication accuracy, and scales efficiently across large
networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Learning to Defer (LtD)方法将人类和ML模型视为互斥决策者，限制了专家贡献仅为预测。需要开发更灵活的人类-AI协作框架。

Method: 基于两阶段架构：标准ML模型和增强专家反馈模型，提供顺序训练和联合训练两种实现方式，设计了具有可实现一致性保证的代理损失函数。

Result: 在合成和真实专家数据上的实验表明，LtA为有效的人类-AI协作提供了更灵活和强大的基础。

Conclusion: LtA框架能够更好地处理何时以及如何整合专家输入，相比LtD方法在人类-AI协作方面更具优势。

Abstract: Developing decision-support systems that complement human performance in
classification tasks remains an open challenge. A popular approach, Learning to
Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a
human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive
decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To
address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that
handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is
based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model
trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy
for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical
implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in
stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the
latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our
experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a
more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究注意力机制transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，发现平衡logit位移可保证泛化但精度下降，并提出dropout和EMA可改善泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化能力，该任务对棋盘游戏式推理至关重要，需要模型预测输入序列中缺失的token的均匀分布。

Method: 理论分析单层注意力transformer的嵌入和值维度边界，证明平衡logit位移可保证长度泛化。提出dropout对抗softmax压缩效应，EMA减少训练噪声。通过随机超参数搜索和OthelloGPT模型验证。

Result: 理论证明：平衡logit位移在长度1和2时可泛化到更长序列但精度降低。实验验证：dropout和EMA确实改善泛化性能，在OthelloGPT中EMA同样有效。

Conclusion: transformer在集合补集任务中的长度泛化受softmax压缩和训练噪声限制，dropout和EMA是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指南或启发式方法在肠内营养治疗中缺乏个性化，无法适应患者不断变化的生理状态。需要开发能够平衡短期生理目标和长期生存结果的数据驱动个性化方法。

Method: 使用来自MIMIC-IV数据库的11,000多名ICU患者数据进行离线训练，采用经过临床精心设计的特征空间和自定义奖励函数，结合dueling double deep Q-network和保守Q学习正则化技术。

Result: DeepEN在各项定性和定量指标上均优于临床医生和基于指南的策略，估计死亡率降低3.7个百分点（18.8% vs 22.5%），关键营养生物标志物也有所改善。

Conclusion: 研究表明，安全、数据驱动的肠内营养个性化治疗有潜力超越传统的指南或启发式方法，改善患者预后。

Abstract: We introduce DeepEN, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
personalized enteral nutrition (EN) in critically ill patients. Trained offline
on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database, DeepEN generates
4-hourly recommendations for caloric, protein, and fluid intake tailored to
each patient's evolving physiology. The model integrates a curated, clinically
informed state space with a custom reward function that balances short-term
physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival outcomes.
Using a dueling double deep Q-network with conservative Q-learning
regularization, DeepEN learns clinically realistic policies that align with
high-value clinician actions while discouraging unsafe deviations. Across
various qualitative and quantitative metrics, DeepEN outperforms
clinician-derived and guideline-based policies, achieving a 3.7 $\pm$ 0.17
percentage-point reduction in estimated mortality (18.8% vs 22.5%) and
improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. These findings highlight the
potential of safe, data-driven personalization of EN therapy to improve
outcomes beyond traditional guideline- or heuristic-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了掩码扩散模型采样过程中的不可逆决策问题，通过错误修正机制显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: The performance of pre-trained masked diffusion models is often constrained
by their sampling procedure, which makes decisions irreversible and struggles
in low-step generation regimes. We introduce a novel sampling algorithm that
works with pre-trained models and, after a lightweight fine-tuning of a single
layer, significantly improves sample quality and efficiency. Our method
reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which
inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we
augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies
and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost,
particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate
key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios.
In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling
algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.

TL;DR: 评估四种对比学习框架在边缘/雾计算环境中的可行性，发现SimCLR能耗最低，并提出轻量化架构搭配CL框架的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习在资源受限设备上的部署研究不足，传统CL框架的高计算需求在能耗、数据可用性和内存使用方面带来挑战。

Method: 系统评估SimCLR、MoCo、SimSiam和Barlow Twins四种CL框架，引入包含能耗分析和减少训练数据条件的基准测试策略。

Result: SimCLR在各种数据条件下表现出最低的能耗，与通常认为的高计算成本认知相反。

Conclusion: 为在计算能力有限的边缘/雾环境中部署对比学习提供了资源影响洞察，并开辟了未来优化的研究方向。

Abstract: While contrastive learning (CL) shows considerable promise in self-supervised
representation learning, its deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
largely underexplored. The substantial computational demands required for
training conventional CL frameworks pose a set of challenges, particularly in
terms of energy consumption, data availability, and memory usage. We conduct an
evaluation of four widely used CL frameworks: SimCLR, MoCo, SimSiam, and Barlow
Twins. We focus on the practical feasibility of these CL frameworks for edge
and fog deployment, and introduce a systematic benchmarking strategy that
includes energy profiling and reduced training data conditions. Our findings
reveal that SimCLR, contrary to its perceived computational cost, demonstrates
the lowest energy consumption across various data regimes. Finally, we also
extend our analysis by evaluating lightweight neural architectures when paired
with CL frameworks. Our study aims to provide insights into the resource
implications of deploying CL in edge/fog environments with limited processing
capabilities and opens several research directions for its future optimization.

Abstract: In this paper we will give a characterization of the learnability of
forgiving 0-1 loss functions in the finite label multiclass setting. To do
this, we create a new combinatorial dimension that is based off of the
Natarajan Dimension \citep{natarajan1989learning} and we show that a hypothesis
class is learnable in our setting if and only if this Generalized Natarajan
Dimension is finite. We also show a connection to learning with set-valued

TL;DR: FlyLoRA是一种基于果蝇嗅觉电路启发的LoRA变体，通过隐式MoE设计消除显式路由器，解决参数干扰问题，在多个领域实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数干扰问题，MoE-based LoRA变体在单任务指令调优中表现良好但引入额外路由器参数，在多任务模型合并中仍然存在任务间干扰。

Method: 提出FlyLoRA：1）在上投影矩阵中引入按秩专家激活；2）使用隐式路由器统一专家路由和下投影，用冻结的稀疏随机投影矩阵替代传统密集可训练版本。

Result: 在通用知识理解、科学问答、数学推理和代码生成四个领域的广泛实验表明，相比现有方法实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FlyLoRA不仅取得了实证收益，还展示了生物结构如何启发AI技术创新，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning
method for foundation models, but it suffers from parameter interference,
resulting in suboptimal performance. Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task
instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain
ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises.
Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit
MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the
up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing
and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces
the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off
between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating
the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task
interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive
experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific
question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate
consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical
gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in
AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究测试了多种深度学习超分辨率模型用于牙本质孔隙成像，发现传统图像质量评估指标与视觉感知不一致，提出了基于孔隙网络结构的生物学驱动评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前牙本质孔隙成像受限于共聚焦显微镜的分辨率与视野范围，需要开发能够通过低分辨率图像恢复高质量图像的超分辨率方法。

Method: 应用三种监督式2D超分辨率模型(RCAN、pix2pix、FSRCNN)和一种无监督模型(CycleGAN)，对实验配对的低分辨率和高分辨率共聚焦图像进行处理，并进行像素尺寸2倍、4倍、8倍的放大。

Result: 传统图像质量评估指标结果不一致且与视觉感知矛盾，而基于孔隙网络连通性和形态学的生物学驱动评估能更好地解释超分辨率模型的性能差异。

Conclusion: 针对特定生物结构如牙本质孔隙网络，需要开发专门的评估方法，而非依赖通用图像质量指标，这对超分辨率技术在生物医学成像中的应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on
Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network
extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity
vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal
fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits
the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this
limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models
to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and
restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models
(RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a
unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images
acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of
x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity
and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded
inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This
raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently
target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting
information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the
specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by
comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to
preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was
evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far
better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences
in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity
in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于PAC-Bayes理论的泛化边界仅在数据丰富时非空泛，无法完全解释提示工程在数据稀缺时的广泛成功。本文认为困惑度作为数据或分布依赖的先验，能够更好地解释这种现象。

Method: 推导基于更实用先验的泛化边界，形式化分析困惑度正则化如何通过限制探索空间来收紧边界，并进行实证研究验证边界有效性和困惑度正则化的实际益处。

Result: 提出了在数据稀缺情况下非空泛的泛化边界，实证显示困惑度正则化能够改善提示的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 困惑度作为有效先验能够解释提示工程的成功，困惑度正则化通过限制探索空间来收紧泛化边界，在数据稀缺情况下尤其有效。

Abstract: Many prompt engineering techniques have been successful in practice, even
when optimizing over a large prompt space with with a small amount of
task-specific data. Recent work has partially explained this success by showing
generalization bounds which apply PAC-Bayes theory to the discrete prompt
space, but they are non-vacuous only in data-rich scenarios. We argue that such
widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully
considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an
effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more
``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that
are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors,
formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by
limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness
and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO等方法需要随机策略，但最经济有效的扩散采样器基于确定性ODE，使用SDE采样器引入随机性会导致收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出DGPO在线RL算法，完全摒弃策略梯度框架，直接从组级偏好学习，利用组内样本的相对信息，无需随机策略。

Result: DGPO训练速度比现有最优方法快约20倍，在领域内和领域外奖励指标上均取得更优性能。

Conclusion: DGPO通过直接组级偏好优化，解决了扩散模型中RL训练的效率问题，实现了快速高效的模型优化。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting
them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a
stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on
deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient
SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic
Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose
Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that
dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly
from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples
within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic
policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster
training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than
existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both
in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at

TL;DR: ClauseLens是一个基于条款的强化学习框架，用于生成透明、合规且风险感知的再保险条约报价，显著减少违规并提高风险表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前再保险条约定价实践不透明且难以审计，需要满足严格的监管标准。

Method: 将报价任务建模为风险感知约束马尔可夫决策过程，从法律和承保语料库中检索条款并嵌入代理观察中，用于约束可行行动并生成基于条款的自然语言解释。

Result: 在多代理条约模拟器中评估，ClauseLens减少偿付能力违规51%，提高尾部风险表现27.9%，条款解释准确率达88.2%，检索精确率87.4%，召回率91.1%。

Conclusion: 将法律背景嵌入决策和解释路径可产生可解释、可审计且符合监管要求的报价行为，符合Solvency II、NAIC RBC和欧盟AI法案。

Abstract: Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.

TL;DR: xRouter是一个基于工具调用的路由系统，使用强化学习训练智能路由器，在成本与性能之间做出最优决策，无需人工设计路由规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM部署面临成本与性能的权衡：高端模型性能强但昂贵，轻量级模型经济但处理复杂任务能力弱。静态路由规则无法充分利用这一频谱且难以适应不同任务类型。

Method: 使用强化学习端到端训练路由器，采用明确的成本感知奖励函数编码成本-性能权衡。路由器可以直接回答问题或调用外部模型，包含完整的强化学习框架和部署评估流程。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，xRouter实现了优秀的成本-性能权衡（如显著降低成本同时保持相近的任务完成率），并提供了关于学习路由有效性的实证见解。

Conclusion: xRouter为推进学习型、成本感知的LLM编排提供了实用基础，研究结果和开源实现将促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Modern LLM deployments confront a widening cost-performance spectrum: premium
models deliver strong reasoning but are expensive, while lightweight models are
economical yet brittle on complex tasks. Static escalation rules and keyword
heuristics under-utilize this spectrum and fail to adapt across task types. We
present xRouter, a tool-calling-based routing system in which a learned router
can either answer directly or invoke one or more external models. The router is
trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware
reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for
hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full
reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well
as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter
achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions
at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what
reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model
trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration
behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open
implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned,
cost-aware LLM orchestration.

Method: 基于复杂动态系统理论设计系列-符号数据生成机制，创建高质量时间序列数据与对应符号表达式对，并开发SymTime预训练模型利用符号信息增强时间序列表示

Result: SymTime在五大时间序列分析任务中表现出竞争力，性能可与在真实数据集上预训练的基础模型相媲美

Conclusion: 系列-符号数据生成和预训练机制具有克服数据稀缺和提升任务性能的潜力

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在消息传递机制中面临过度压缩问题，即来自大感受野的节点信息被压缩到固定大小的向量中，造成信息瓶颈。

Method: 通过分析现有过度压缩测量任务的局限性，引入新的合成任务来验证容量饱和现象，并借鉴序列建模中的关联记忆、快速权重编程和xLSTM思想，开发了新的GNN架构。

Result: 新架构在容量合成任务和多个真实世界图基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过重新定义存储和检索容量，并借鉴序列建模技术，可以有效缓解GNN中的过度压缩问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活函数比较大多是启发式的，缺乏严格的分类框架来指导激活函数的选择，无法从理论上保证网络的稳定性和表达能力。

Method: 构建九维积分签名S_sigma(phi)，包括高斯传播统计(m1,g1,g2,m2,eta)、渐近斜率(alpha_plus,alpha_minus)和正则性度量(TV(phi'),C(phi))，进行动力学分析和核视角分析。

Result: 对八种标准激活函数进行了分类，证明了饱和、线性增长和平滑族之间的明显区别，数值验证证实了理论预测。

Conclusion: 该框架为激活函数选择提供了原则性设计指导，将激活函数选择从试错转向可证明的稳定性和核条件化。

Abstract: Activation functions govern the expressivity and stability of neural
networks, yet existing comparisons remain largely heuristic. We propose a
rigorous framework for their classification via a nine-dimensional integral
signature S_sigma(phi), combining Gaussian propagation statistics (m1, g1, g2,
m2, eta), asymptotic slopes (alpha_plus, alpha_minus), and regularity measures
(TV(phi'), C(phi)). This taxonomy establishes well-posedness, affine
reparameterization laws with bias, and closure under bounded slope variation.
Dynamical analysis yields Lyapunov theorems with explicit descent constants and
identifies variance stability regions through (m2', g2). From a kernel
perspective, we derive dimension-free Hessian bounds and connect smoothness to
bounded variation of phi'. Applying the framework, we classify eight standard
activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving
sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families.
Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical
predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving
activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel
conditioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频摘要视为确定性回归任务，忽略了任务固有的主观性，无法反映不同人类标注者的偏好。

Method: 采用扩散模型框架，将视频摘要作为条件生成任务，模型学习良好摘要的分布，根据输入视频动态适应视觉上下文并生成多个候选摘要。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，生成的摘要更贴近个体标注者偏好，并通过背包问题分析提供了新的评估指标。

Conclusion: SummDiff通过条件生成框架成功捕捉了视频摘要的主观性，扩散模型在该任务中表现出色，为评估提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Video summarization is a task of shortening a video by choosing a subset of
frames while preserving its essential moments. Despite the innate subjectivity
of the task, previous works have deterministically regressed to an averaged
frame score over multiple raters, ignoring the inherent subjectivity of what
constitutes a good summary. We propose a novel problem formulation by framing
video summarization as a conditional generation task, allowing a model to learn
the distribution of good summaries and to generate multiple plausible summaries
that better reflect varying human perspectives. Adopting diffusion models for
the first time in video summarization, our proposed method, SummDiff,
dynamically adapts to visual contexts and generates multiple candidate
summaries conditioned on the input video. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SummDiff not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various
benchmarks but also produces summaries that closely align with individual
annotator preferences. Moreover, we provide a deeper insight with novel metrics
from an analysis of the knapsack, which is an important last step of generating
summaries but has been overlooked in evaluation.

Motivation: 传统聚类算法受限于预定义的相似性度量，无法灵活捕捉复杂关系。LLM的注意力机制具有识别数据内在结构的能力，但尚未在无监督聚类任务中得到充分探索。

Method: 利用预训练LLM的注意力矩阵进行谱聚类，通过Next Token Prediction损失对LLM进行微调以增强聚类能力，并利用提示灵活性实现文本条件图像聚类。

Result: LLM在文本编码的数值数据上展现出令人印象深刻的零样本聚类能力，注意力矩阵显示出显著的聚类模式。基于注意力矩阵的谱聚类表现出有竞争力的性能，且能够实现传统方法无法做到的文本条件图像聚类。

Conclusion: 该工作将上下文学习扩展到无监督设置，展示了LLM在聚类任务中的有效性和灵活性，为LLM在无监督学习领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We propose In-Context Clustering (ICC), a flexible LLM-based procedure for
clustering data from diverse distributions. Unlike traditional clustering
algorithms constrained by predefined similarity measures, ICC flexibly captures
complex relationships among inputs through an attention mechanism. We show that
pretrained LLMs exhibit impressive zero-shot clustering capabilities on
text-encoded numeric data, with attention matrices showing salient cluster
patterns. Spectral clustering using attention matrices offers surprisingly
competitive performance. We further enhance the clustering capabilities of LLMs
on numeric and image data through fine-tuning using the Next Token Prediction
(NTP) loss. Moreover, the flexibility of LLM prompting enables text-conditioned
image clustering, a capability that classical clustering methods lack. Our work
extends in-context learning to an unsupervised setting, showcasing the
effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs for clustering. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UML提出了一种模态无关的训练范式，通过交替处理不同模态的输入并共享参数，利用未配对的辅助多模态数据来增强目标模态的表征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习依赖配对数据集，但大量未配对的多模态数据未被充分利用。本文探索是否可以利用未配对的辅助多模态数据直接增强目标模态的表征学习。

Method: 提出UML（Unpaired Multimodal Learner）方法，采用模态无关的训练范式，单一模型交替处理不同模态的输入，同时跨模态共享参数。该方法基于不同模态是共享底层现实的投影这一假设。

Result: 理论上在线性数据生成假设下，证明未配对辅助数据可以产生比单模态训练更丰富的信息表示。实证表明，使用文本、音频或图像等辅助模态的未配对数据，能持续提升图像和音频等单模态目标的下游性能。

Conclusion: UML方法成功证明了未配对多模态数据在增强单模态表征学习方面的有效性，为利用大量未配对数据提供了新思路。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like
visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an
overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary
unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a
target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a
modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately
processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across
them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are
projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from
cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under
linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can
yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating
process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data
from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently
improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image
and audio. Our project page: https://unpaired-multimodal.github.io/

*Yuanjun Dai,Keqiang He,An Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DYNAMIX是一个基于强化学习的批量大小优化框架，使用PPO算法将批量大小选择建模为序列决策问题，在异构动态计算环境中实现自适应优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布式机器学习批量大小选择方法采用静态分配或简单启发式策略，无法适应异构、动态的计算环境。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，采用包含网络指标、系统资源利用率和训练统计效率指标的多维状态表示，通过PPO算法进行批量大小优化决策。

Result: 在多样化工作负载、硬件配置和网络条件下，DYNAMIX实现了最终模型精度提升6.3%，总训练时间减少46%。在32节点集群规模下保持最佳性能，学习策略能有效跨模型架构迁移。

Conclusion: DYNAMIX无需显式系统建模即可无缝集成到现有分布式训练框架中，在异构动态环境中显著提升训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: Existing batch size selection approaches in distributed machine learning rely
on static allocation or simplistic heuristics that fail to adapt to
heterogeneous, dynamic computing environments. We present DYNAMIX, a
reinforcement learning framework that formulates batch size optimization as a
sequential decision-making problem using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Our approach employs a multi-dimensional state representation encompassing
network-level metrics, system-level resource utilization, and training
statistical efficiency indicators to enable informed decision-making across
diverse computational resources. Our approach eliminates the need for explicit
system modeling while integrating seamlessly with existing distributed training
frameworks. Through evaluations across diverse workloads, hardware
configurations, and network conditions, DYNAMIX achieves up to 6.3% improvement
in the final model accuracy and 46% reduction in the total training time. Our
scalability experiments demonstrate that DYNAMIX maintains the best performance
as cluster size increases to 32 nodes, while policy transfer experiments show
that learned policies generalize effectively across related model
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出一个理论框架，通过熵正则化和温度解耦策略，保证收敛到特定最优策略，实现可解释、保持多样性的最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在寻找最优策略时通常忽略学习策略的特性，难以描述哪些策略会被学习及其行为特征。

Method: 使用熵正则化和温度解耦策略，在正则化温度趋近于零时实现可解释、保持多样性的最优策略，并确保策略相关对象（价值函数和回报分布）的收敛性。

Result: 该方法能收敛到特定最优策略，其中一个实例中实现的策略会均匀采样所有最优动作。通过温度解耦策略，可以任意精度估计与可解释、保持多样性的最优策略相关的回报分布。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习提供了理论保证，能够产生可解释且保持多样性的最优策略，同时确保策略相关对象的收敛性。

Abstract: In the pursuit of finding an optimal policy, reinforcement learning (RL)
methods generally ignore the properties of learned policies apart from their
expected return. Thus, even when successful, it is difficult to characterize
which policies will be learned and what they will do. In this work, we present
a theoretical framework for policy optimization that guarantees convergence to
a particular optimal policy, via vanishing entropy regularization and a
temperature decoupling gambit. Our approach realizes an interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes
and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and
return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the
realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly. Leveraging our
temperature decoupling gambit, we present an algorithm that estimates, to
arbitrary accuracy, the return distribution associated to its interpretable,
diversity-preserving optimal policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GDPO算法，通过半确定性蒙特卡洛方案降低ELBO估计器方差，解决了扩散语言模型强化学习微调中的似然估计难题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型具有并行生成和迭代优化的优势，但难以应用强化学习微调，因为传统方法存在严重偏差或计算成本过高的问题

Method: 使用半确定性蒙特卡洛方案降低ELBO估计器方差，提出Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)算法

Result: GDPO在数学、推理和编程基准测试中优于预训练检查点和当前最先进的diffu-GRPO方法

Conclusion: GDPO为扩散语言模型的强化学习微调提供了有效解决方案，在多个基准测试中表现出色

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.

### [213] [Who Said Neural Networks Aren't Linear?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08570)
*Nimrod Berman,Assaf Hallak,Assaf Shocher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为Linearizer的架构，通过在两个可逆神经网络之间夹入线性算子，使得非线性函数在特定向量空间中表现为线性，从而将线性代数工具应用于非线性映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络本质上是非线性的，但线性性是相对于向量空间对定义的。本文旨在寻找使传统非线性函数在其中表现为线性的非标准向量空间对。

Method: 提出Linearizer架构：f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))，其中g_x和g_y是可逆神经网络，A是线性算子。通过g_x和g_y导出新的加法和缩放操作，构建特定的向量空间。

Result: 该框架使SVD、伪逆、正交投影等线性代数工具可应用于非线性映射。两个共享神经网络的Linearizer组合仍是Linearizer，可将扩散模型的数百步采样压缩为单步。

Conclusion: Linearizer架构成功地将线性代数工具扩展到非线性映射，在扩散模型采样、投影生成模型和模块化风格迁移等任务中展现出强大应用潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined
relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to
identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally
nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that
makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich
a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A
g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly
defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this
kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of
linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more,
applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of
two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage
this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our
architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step.
We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$)
on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to
demonstrate modular style transfer.

### [214] [Clustering in Varying Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07860)
*Deeparnab Chakrabarty,Jonathan Conroy,Ankita Sarkar*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了聚合聚类问题，即在多个不同度量下对相同点集进行中心聚类，目标是找到k个中心以最小化聚类成本的聚合（如平均值或最大值）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中，数据可能需要在不同度量或视角下进行聚类分析，但现有方法主要针对单一度量。聚合聚类问题旨在解决多度量场景下的聚类优化需求。

Method: 采用参数化复杂性分析，研究不同参数（如k、T）下的近似算法。对于T≥3的情况证明不可近似性，对T=2给出常数因子近似，并针对有结构的度量（如有界散射维数或树宽限制）设计高效参数化近似方案。

Result: T≥3时问题在多项式时间内不可近似到任何有限因子；T=2时可获得常数因子近似；当参数化为k和T时，获得3-近似；对于有结构度量，获得(1+ε)-近似。

Conclusion: 聚合聚类问题在一般情况下的计算复杂性很高，但在特定参数化设置和度量结构下，可以设计有效的近似算法。除非ETH错误，否则仅参数化T无法获得有限因子近似。

Abstract: We introduce the aggregated clustering problem, where one is given $T$
instances of a center-based clustering task over the same $n$ points, but under
different metrics. The goal is to open $k$ centers to minimize an aggregate of
the clustering costs -- e.g., the average or maximum -- where the cost is
measured via $k$-center/median/means objectives. More generally, we minimize a
norm $\Psi$ over the $T$ cost values.
  We show that for $T \geq 3$, the problem is inapproximable to any finite
factor in polynomial time. For $T = 2$, we give constant-factor approximations.
We also show W[2]-hardness when parameterized by $k$, but obtain
$f(k,T)\mathrm{poly}(n)$-time 3-approximations when parameterized by both $k$
and $T$.
  When the metrics have structure, we obtain efficient parameterized
approximation schemes (EPAS). If all $T$ metrics have bounded
$\varepsilon$-scatter dimension, we achieve a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
in $f(k,T,\varepsilon)\mathrm{poly}(n)$ time. If the metrics are induced by
edge weights on a common graph $G$ of bounded treewidth $\mathsf{tw}$, and
$\Psi$ is the sum function, we get an EPAS in
$f(T,\varepsilon,\mathsf{tw})\mathrm{poly}(n,k)$ time. Conversely, unless
(randomized) ETH is false, any finite factor approximation is impossible if
parametrized by only $T$, even when the treewidth is $\mathsf{tw} =
\Omega(\mathrm{poly}\log n)$.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了时序图中的顶点覆盖和支配集问题，提出了基于顶点区间成员宽度和区间成员宽度的参数化算法，发现支配集问题在某些参数组合下比顶点覆盖问题更容易处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图问题通常比静态图问题更困难，本文旨在继续研究时序顶点覆盖问题并引入时序支配集问题，从经典和参数化角度分析这两个问题及其部分版本。

Method: 使用参数化复杂度理论，考虑顶点区间成员宽度(vimw)和区间成员宽度(imw)等时序图参数，分析问题在不同参数组合下的可解性。

Result: 所有考虑的问题在参数vimw+k+ℓ下都允许FPT算法。对于参数imw+k+ℓ，时序支配集问题允许FPT算法，而时序顶点覆盖问题即使在该参数为常数时也是NP难的。

Conclusion: 时序支配集问题在某些参数组合下比时序顶点覆盖问题更容易处理，这为时序图问题的参数化分析提供了新的见解。

Abstract: A temporal graph is a finite sequence of graphs, called snapshots, over the
same vertex set. Many temporal graph problems turn out to be much more
difficult than their static counterparts. One such problem is \textsc{Timeline
Vertex Cover} (also known as \textsc{MinTimeline$_\infty$}), a temporal
analogue to the classical \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. In this problem, one
is given a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ and two integers $k$ and $\ell$, and
the goal is to cover each edge of each snapshot by selecting for each vertex at
most $k$ activity intervals of length at most $\ell$ each. Here, an edge $uv$
in the $i$th snapshot is covered, if an activity interval of $u$ or $v$ is
active at time $i$. In this work, we continue the algorithmic study of
\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover} and introduce the \textsc{Timeline Dominating
Set} problem where we want to dominate all vertices in each snapshot by the
selected activity intervals.
  We analyze both problems from a classical and parameterized point of view and
also consider partial problem versions, where the goal is to cover (dominate)
at least $t$ edges (vertices) of the snapshots. With respect to the
parameterized complexity, we consider the temporal graph parameters
vertex-interval-membership-width $(vimw)$ and interval-membership-width
$(imw)$. We show that all considered problems admit FPT-algorithms when
parameterized by $vimw + k+\ell$. This provides a smaller parameter combination
than the ones used for previously known FPT-algorithms for \textsc{Timeline
Vertex Cover}. Surprisingly, for $imw+ k+\ell$, \textsc{Timeline Dominating
Set} turns out to be easier than \textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}, by also
admitting an FPT-algorithm, whereas the vertex cover version is NP-hard even if
$imw+\, k+\ell$ is constant. We also consider parameterization by combinations
of $n$, the vertex set size, with $k$ or $\ell$ and parameterization by $t$.

### [216] [Dynamic Connectivity with Expected Polylogarithmic Worst-Case Update Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08297)
*Simon Meierhans,Maximilian Probst Gutenberg*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于核心图框架的新动态连通性算法，实现了多对数期望最坏情况更新时间的动态连通性维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图的连通性是基础但具有挑战性的问题。虽然已有算法实现了多对数摊还更新时间，但实现最坏情况保证一直很困难。最近的研究取得了突破，但仍存在随机性或亚多项式更新时间的问题。

Method: 采用核心图框架，该框架维护一个层次结构，交替进行顶点和边稀疏化。通过新的实现方法，在动态连通性场景下实现了多对数期望最坏情况更新时间。

Result: 算法实现了多对数期望最坏情况更新时间，并且可以通过去随机化技术获得确定性版本。结合最新的静态算法，可以得到确定性亚多项式最坏情况更新时间。

Conclusion: 本文首次在核心图框架下实现了多对数最坏情况更新时间的动态连通性算法，为动态图连通性研究提供了新的突破。

Abstract: Whether a graph $G=(V,E)$ is connected is arguably its most fundamental
property. Naturally, connectivity was the first characteristic studied for
dynamic graphs, i.e. graphs that undergo edge insertions and deletions. While
connectivity algorithms with polylogarithmic amortized update time have been
known since the 90s, achieving worst-case guarantees has proven more elusive.
  Two recent breakthroughs have made important progress on this question: (1)
Kapron, King and Mountjoy [SODA'13; Best Paper] gave a Monte-Carlo algorithm
with polylogarithmic worst-case update time, and (2) Nanongkai, Saranurak and
Wulff-Nilsen [STOC'17, FOCS'17] obtained a Las-Vegas data structure, however,
with subpolynomial worst-case update time. Their algorithm was subsequently
de-randomized [FOCS'20].
  In this article, we present a new dynamic connectivity algorithm based on the
popular core graph framework that maintains a hierarchy interleaving vertex and
edge sparsification. Previous dynamic implementations of the core graph
framework required subpolynomial update time. In contrast, we show how to
implement it for dynamic connectivity with polylogarithmic expected worst-case
update time.
  We further show that the algorithm can be de-randomized efficiently: a
deterministic static algorithm for computing a connectivity edge-sparsifier of
low congestion in time $T(m) \cdot m$ on an $m$-edge graph yields a
deterministic dynamic connectivity algorithm with $\tilde{O}(T(m))$ worst-case
update time. Via current state-of-the-art algorithms [STOC'24], we obtain $T(m)
= m^{o(1)}$ and recover deterministic subpolynomial worst-case update time.
