Exploiting\nthese vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to\ngain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This\npaper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced\nPersistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that\nleverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the\nproposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on \"strategic-level\" design for\ndefensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates \"operational-level\"\nactions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\n(TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the\ncross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage\nstrategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's\ninitial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed\ndeception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive\none during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total\nrewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even\nsmall initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and\nsecure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the\nattacker's lifecycle."}

A common practice in\nexisting benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general\nknowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and\nrelationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic\niteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto\nstandards have not been critically examined.

Accurate\nclassification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels,\nbut their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used\nbecause they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often\ncontain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels\n(FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by\ncarefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly\nmanual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse\nitems. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation\nLearning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with\nlarge language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL\ndataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier\nfinds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our\nexperiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored\nitem feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In\ncontrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the\nimprovement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy.\nThese contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's\nknowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that\nadjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD)."}

The running time of our algorithms is\n$O(f(w)\\cdot\\mathrm{poly}(n,p_{\\text{max}}))$, where $f$ is some function in\nthe treewidth $w$, $n$ is the input size, and $p_{\\text{max}}$ is an upper\nbound on the size of the Pareto sets of the subproblems that occur in the\ndynamic program. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of computing\nPareto sets on real-world instances of polygon aggregation problems. For this\nmatter we devised a task-specific data structure that allows for efficient\nstorage and modification of large sets of Pareto-optimal solutions. Throughout\nthe implementation process, we incorporated several improved strategies and\nheuristics that significantly reduced both runtime and memory usage, enabling\nus to solve instances with treewidth of up to 22 within reasonable amount of\ntime. Moreover, we conducted a preprocessing study to compare different tree\ndecompositions in terms of their estimated overall runtime."}

Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk\ntree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient\napproximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we\napproximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal\nprobability of a vertex's spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.\n  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we\nindeed prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in\nturn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model.

However, urban road\nnetworks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate\nrepresentation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from\nneighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus\non a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents\nMSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that\nintegrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow\nheterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution\nto extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies\nscale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of\nroad networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,\nMSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple\nscales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,\nwhich are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road\nnetwork representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that\nMSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The\nperformance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more\nfrom incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in\ncomplex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the\nmost competitive baseline method.

At first glance, the nature of learning\ntask-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for\neffective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on\nworld models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been\nthoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both\nparadigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different\nenvironments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline\ncounterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of\noffline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This\nissue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,\noffline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between\nthe agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We\ndemonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online\ninteractions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of\nonline training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that\nincorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of\noffline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data\nwhen collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on\nexpert data alone."}

And can their internal representations be\nleveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To\ninvestigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal\nintervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments\nof one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)\nduring the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:\ninjecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm\nsemantics suppresses crashes and restores stability.

Recently, self-supervised learning techniques\nhave demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by\nlearning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In\nparticular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the\ndistance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it\nbetween dissimilar (negative) views.

However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low\nhallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of\ntest-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive\nbenchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not\nconsistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more\nhallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination\nbehavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model\nchoosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual\nrecall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on\npreviously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case\nstudies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to\noverconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that\ncompared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data\nare available at https://github.com/XuZhao0/tts-knowledge"}

Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive\nartifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and\ndiscovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial\neffort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own\nwork, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this\nchallenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a\nknowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the\nassociated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol\n(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify\nthe resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat\nagent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through\nnatural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We\ndemonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper\nagents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that\nleverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy\nand TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We\nvalidate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and\ncan correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into\ndynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for\nknowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI\nco-scientists."}

However,\nthey exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with\ngradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,\nthus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often\nneed continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired\naesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address\nthe limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that\npredefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time\nsteps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are\ninterpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids\nover-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic\nRelative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as\ntext-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in\nresponse to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the\nreliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model\nwith optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its\nhuman-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x."}
