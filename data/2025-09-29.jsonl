It is, however, evident that this step\ncan cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.\n  In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning\nproblem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization\nto equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets.\nDefining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning\nmust select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic\nprogramming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased\nbinning problem.\n  Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness,\nor it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different\ndistributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be\ntolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem\nthat bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We\nfirst develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal\nbinning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale\nto very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm,\nbased on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of\nthe LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a\nnear-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C\nfinds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm\nthen initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to\nfind the optimal solution."}

However, existing studies are primarily based on\none-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and\nscales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either\nzero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between\nthe new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on\nthe new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge\nacquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning\nparadigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse\ndistributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to\neffectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their\nperformance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called\nLifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.\nLLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the\nsolver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.\nTo encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater\nconsolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments\non capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems\ndemonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers\nin a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,\nmaintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability."}

While prior research\nhas largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain\nunderexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct\ntrigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction\nbetween retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships\nbetween target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert\ninfluence on content generation.\n  This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness\nvulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the\npre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group\nwith the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the\npost-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases\nto reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining\nundetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures\nprecise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and\nresilience.

We\npropose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key\nstages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy\nlearning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature\nlearning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$\nacross layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden\nrepresentation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only\ndepends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their\nrepresentation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about\ntarget labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics\nfollows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local\nmaxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima\ninduced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they\nchange on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks.

However, existing research has primarily\nfocused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how\naltruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges\nin large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a\nSchelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,\ncompelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between\negoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central\nfinding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We\nidentify two distinct archetypes: \"Adaptive Egoists\", which default to\nprioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly\nincrease under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and\n\"Altruistic Optimizers\", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,\nconsistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to\nthemselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings\nof these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to\nsystematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the\nfirst evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic\ntendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model\nselection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of\nchoosing an intrinsic social action logic. While \"Adaptive Egoists\" may offer a\nmore suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, \"Altruistic\nOptimizers\" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or\nscenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration."}

In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning\nDistraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve\ncontexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,\nthereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage\ncompared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM\narchitectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of\nbalancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction."}

In this paper, we introduce\nSpectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing\nuncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum\ninformation theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical\nfoundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and\nepistemic components.

Second, statistical\nheterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can\nlead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these\nchallenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to\nencourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these\nchallenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates\nefficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the\ncontext of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully\nheterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an\nincentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated\nlearning training by providing incentives within this complex federated\nlearning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the\nperformance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of\ncomplex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model\narchitectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID\nscenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease\ncommunication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and\nmodel heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and\nbaselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH\nachieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions."}
