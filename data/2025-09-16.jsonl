Yet, achieving high\nperformance for both reads and writes is challenging due to traditionally\nlimited memory and the pick-any-two-out-of-three tradeoff between memory use,\nread performance, and write performance. Existing state-of-the-art approaches\nlimit memory usage and chose a primary dimension (reads or writes) for which to\noptimize their on-disk structures. They recover performance in the remaining\ndimension by other mechanisms. This approach limits databases' maximum\nperformance in the remaining dimension and their dynamic (online) tunability to\nrespond to changing workloads. We explore a different approach that dynamically\ntrades memory for read or write performance as needed. We present TurtleKV,\nwhich includes a novel unbiased data structure for on-disk storage. It includes\na knob that dynamically increases memory reserved for increasing read or write\nperformance. When evaluated on YCSB, TurtleKV achieves up to 8x the write\nthroughput of industry-leader RocksDB and up to 5x the read throughput while\nincurring similar space amplification. Compared to the state-of-the-art system\nSplinterDB, TurtleKV runs up to 40% better on point queries, up to 6x better on\nrange scans and achieves similar write performance, while incurring 50% less\nspace amplification."}

The standard approach for\nmeasuring the diversity of a set of tuples is to use a distance function\nbetween tuples, which measures the dissimilarity between them, to then\naggregate the pairwise distances of the set into a score (e.g., by using sum or\nmin aggregation). However, as we will point out in this work, the resulting\ndiversity measures may display some unintuitive behavior. Moreover, even in\nvery simple settings, finding a maximally diverse subset of the answers of\nfixed size is, in general, intractable and little is known about approximations\napart from some hand-picked distance-aggregator pairs.\n  In this work, we introduce a novel approach for computing the diversity of\ntuples based on volume instead of distance.

Theory, 2021] showed that $c(T) \\in O(z(T))$ and there is a\nstring family with $c(T) \\in \\Omega(b(T) \\log |T|)$, where $z(T)$ is the number\nof Lempel-Ziv parsing of $T$ and $b(T)$ is the smallest size of bidirectional\nschemes for $T$. They also introduced a subclass of collage systems, called\ninternal collage systems, and proved that its smallest size $\\hat{c}(T)$ for\n$T$ is at least $b(T)$. While $c(T) \\le \\hat{c}(T)$ is obvious, it is unknown\nhow large $\\hat{c}(T)$ is compared to $c(T)$. In this paper, we prove that\n$\\hat{c}(T) = \\Theta(c(T))$ by showing that any collage system of size $m$ can\nbe transformed into an internal collage system of size $O(m)$ in $O(m^2)$ time.\nThanks to this result, we can focus on internal collage systems to study the\nasymptotic behavior of $c(T)$, which helps to suppress excess use of truncation\nrules. As a direct application, we get $b(T) = O(c(T))$, which answers an open\nquestion posed in [Navarro et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021]. We also give\na MAX-SAT formulation to compute $\\hat{c}(T)$ for a given $T$."}

Large Language\nModels (LLMs) offer unprecedented analytical opportunities however, their\nknowledge base is constrained to the models' last training date, rendering\nthese capabilities unusable for organizations whose mission impacts rely on\nemerging and timely information.

Through experimentation, this study evaluates the combinatorial\neffects of these techniques towards timeliness and quality trade-offs. Our\nresults suggest that in applying RAG systems to supply chain analysis,\nfine-tuning the embedding retrieval model consistently provides the most\nsignificant performance gains, underscoring the critical importance of\nretrieval quality. Adaptive iterative retrieval, which dynamically adjusts\nretrieval depth based on context, further enhances performance, especially on\ncomplex supply chain queries.

Given a directed graph $G$ and integers\n$d$ and $k$, the standard problem asks whether $G$ contains a packing of\nvertex-disjoint cycles, each of length $\\leq d$, covering at least $k$ vertices\nin total. In the multi-agent setting we consider, the vertex set is partitioned\nover several agents who reject a cycle packing as solution if it can be\nmodified into an alternative packing that covers more of their own vertices. A\ncycle packing is called rejection-proof if no agent rejects it and the problem\nasks whether such a packing exists that covers at least $k$ vertices.\n  We exploit the sunflower lemma on a set packing formulation of the problem to\ngive a kernel for this $\\Sigma_2^P$-complete problem that is polynomial in $k$\nfor all constant values of $d$. We also provide a $2^{\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)} +\nn^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ algorithm based on it and show that this FPT algorithm is\nasymptotically optimal under the ETH. Further, we generalize the problem by\nincluding an additional positive integer $c$ in the input that naturally\ncaptures how much agents can modify a given cycle packing to reject it. For\nevery constant $c$, the resulting problem simplifies from being\n$\\Sigma_2^P$-complete to NP-complete. With a single-exponential algorithm for\nthe setting where $c = 1$, we show this to be strictly easier under the ETH\nthan when $c = 2$. In turn, we show that any $c \\geq 2$ yields a problem that\nis essentially as hard as the original problem with $c$ unbounded.

The early feature selection selects\na fixed subset of features and retrains the model, while the late feature\nselection, known as adaptive feature selection, dynamically adjusts feature\nchoices for each data instance, recognizing the variability in feature\nsignificance. Although adaptive feature selection has shown remarkable\nimprovements in performance, its main drawback lies in its post-embedding layer\nfeature selection.

Our concentration guarantees hold universally for a broad class of\ndesign matrices and remain valid over long time horizons until algorithmic\nconvergence or divergence occurs. Moreover, our approach reveals that gradient\ndescent iterates are in general approximately independent of the data and\nstrongly incoherent with the feature vectors, a phenomenon previously known as\nthe `implicit regularization' effect of gradient descent in specific models\nunder Gaussian data.\n  As an illustration of the utility of our general theory, we present two\napplications of different natures in the regression setting.

Our methodology implements an iterative workflow: training\nan LTC observer on candidate inputs, quantifying each input's causal impact\nthrough controlled perturbation analysis, removing inputs with negligible\neffect, and retraining until performance degradation occurs. We demonstrate\nthis approach on three mechanistic testbeds representing distinct physical\ndomains: a harmonically forced spring-mass-damper system, a nonlinear\ncontinuous stirred-tank reactor, and a predator-prey model following the\nstructure of the Lotka-Volterra model, but with seasonal forcing and added\ncomplexity.

We propose a unified data-driven framework that combines\nthe mathematical structure of the governing differential equations with the\nflexibility of neural networks (NNs). At the core of our approach is the\nconcept of characteristic curves (CCs), which represent individual nonlinear\nfunctions (e.g., friction and restoring components) of the system. Each CC is\nmodeled by a dedicated NN, enabling a modular and interpretable representation\nof the system equation. To demonstrate the versatility of the CC-based\nformalism, we introduce three identification strategies: (1) SINDy-CC, which\nextends the sparse regression approach of SINDy by incorporating the\nmathematical structure of the governing equations as constraints; (2) Poly-CC,\nwhich represents each CC using high-degree polynomials; and (3) NN-CC, which\nuses NNs without requiring prior assumptions about basis functions. Our results\nshow that all three approaches are well-suited for systems with simple\npolynomial nonlinearities, such as the van der Pol oscillator. In contrast,\nNN-CC demonstrates superior performance in modeling systems with complex\nnonlinearities and discontinuities, such as those observed in stick-slip\nsystems. The key contribution of this work is to demonstrate that the CC-based\nframework, particularly the NN-CC approach, can capture complex nonlinearities\nwhile maintaining interpretability through the explicit representation of the\nCCs.

In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make\ninfere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for\nproper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively\nguide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from\nreaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity\nsimulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses\ncomplex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs\nwith the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world\nmodel and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable\nautonomous agents."}

To address these limitations, we propose to learn DEcomposed\nCOntextual Token Representations (DECOR), a unified framework that preserves\npretrained semantics while enhancing the adaptability of token embeddings.\nDECOR introduces contextualized token composition to refine token embeddings\nbased on user interaction context, and decomposed embedding fusion that\nintegrates pretrained codebook embeddings with newly learned collaborative\nembeddings. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that DECOR\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation\nperformance.

Our framework\ntransforms the pruning process by introducing a graph representation of the\ntarget neural network that captures complete topological relationships between\nlayers and channels, replacing the limited layer-wise observation space with a\nglobal view of network structure. The core innovations include a Graph\nAttention Network (GAT) encoder that processes the network's graph\nrepresentation and generates a rich embedding.

This paper focuses\non comparing different distributed adversarial training algorithms--including\ncentralized and decentralized strategies--within multi-agent learning\nenvironments. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of model\nflatness in determining robustness. To this end, we develop a general\ntheoretical framework to study the escaping efficiency of these algorithms from\nlocal minima, which is closely related to the flatness of the resulting models.\nWe show that when the perturbation bound is sufficiently small (i.e., when the\nattack strength is relatively mild) and a large batch size is used,\ndecentralized adversarial training algorithms--including consensus and\ndiffusion--are guaranteed to escape faster from local minima than the\ncentralized strategy, thereby favoring flatter minima. However, as the\nperturbation bound increases, this trend may no longer hold.

Originally\ndeveloped for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on\nmillions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via\nin context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new\nunlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass,\nwithout gradient updates or task specific fine tuning.

Many existing Class\nIncremental Learning (CIL) methods achieve high accuracy by continually\nadapting their feature representations; however, they often require substantial\ncomputational resources and complex, iterative training procedures. This work\nintroduces CIFNet (Class Incremental and Frugal Network), a novel CIL approach\nthat addresses these limitations by offering a highly efficient and sustainable\nsolution. CIFNet's key innovation lies in its novel integration of several\nexisting, yet separately explored, components: a pre-trained and frozen feature\nextractor, a compressed data buffer, and an efficient non-iterative one-layer\nneural network for classification. A pre-trained and frozen feature extractor\neliminates computationally expensive fine-tuning of the backbone.

Recent work has introduced structural fidelity as a\ntabular-specific evaluation dimension to assess whether synthetic data complies\nwith the causal structures of real data. However, existing benchmarks often\nneglect the interplay between structural fidelity and conventional evaluation\ndimensions, thus failing to provide a holistic understanding of model\nperformance. Moreover, they are typically limited to toy datasets, as\nquantifying existing structural fidelity metrics requires access to\nground-truth causal structures, which are rarely available for real-world\ndatasets. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework that jointly\nconsiders structural fidelity and conventional evaluation dimensions. We\nintroduce a new evaluation metric, $\\textbf{global utility}$, which enables the\nassessment of structural fidelity even in the absence of ground-truth causal\nstructures.

The choice of these saddle points is motivated from previous works\non homogeneous networks, which identified the first saddle point encountered by\ngradient flow after escaping the origin. It is shown here that, when\ninitialized sufficiently close to such saddle points, gradient flow remains\nnear the saddle point for a sufficiently long time, during which the set of\nweights with small norm remain small but converge in direction. Furthermore,\nimportant empirical observations are made on the behavior of gradient descent\nafter escaping these saddle points. The second part of the paper, motivated by\nthese results, introduces a greedy algorithm to train deep neural networks\ncalled Neuron Pursuit (NP). It is an iterative procedure which alternates\nbetween expanding the network by adding neuron(s) with carefully chosen\nweights, and minimizing the training loss using this augmented network. The\nefficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated using numerical experiments."}

Our\napproach integrates spectral normalization for stable training, identity- and\nperceptual-guided losses to preserve subject identity and high-level structure,\nand landmark-weighted cycle constraints to maintain facial geometry across pose\nand illumination changes. Experiments show that our adversarial trained\nCycleGAN improves realism (FID), perceptual quality (LPIPS), and identity\npreservation (ID-Sim) over autoencoders, with competitive cycle-reconstruction\nSSIM and practical inference times, which achieved high quality without paired\ndatasets and approaching pix2pix on curated paired subsets.

Second, materials datasets should not be split\nrandomly if polymorphs of many different compositions are numerous, which we\nfind to be the case for the perov-5 dataset. Third, benchmarks can mislead if\nused uncritically, e.g., reporting a match rate metric without considering the\nstructural variety exhibited by identical building blocks. To address these\noft-overlooked issues, we introduce several fixes. We provide revised versions\nof the carbon-24 dataset: one with duplicates removed, one deduplicated and\nsplit by number of atoms $N$, and two containing only identical structures but\nwith different unit cells. We also propose a new split for the perov-5 dataset\nwhich ensures polymorphs are grouped within each split subset, setting a more\nsensible standard for benchmarking model performance.

This limits their representational alignment with the potentially\ndiverse relational dynamics of each token-pair interaction. While they excel in\ndomains with relatively homogeneous relationships, standard attention's static\nrelational learning struggles to capture the diverse, heterogeneous\ninter-channel dependencies of multivariate time series (MTS) data--where\ndifferent channel-pair interactions within a single system may be governed by\nentirely different physical laws or temporal dynamics. To better align the\nattention mechanism for such domain phenomena, we propose attention with\ndynamic relational priming (prime attention). Unlike standard attention where\neach token presents an identical representation across all of its pair-wise\ninteractions, prime attention tailors each token dynamically (or per\ninteraction) through learnable modulations to best capture the unique\nrelational dynamics of each token pair, optimizing each pair-wise interaction\nfor that specific relationship. This representational plasticity of prime\nattention enables effective extraction of relationship-specific information in\nMTS while maintaining the same asymptotic computational complexity as standard\nattention. Our results demonstrate that prime attention consistently\noutperforms standard attention across benchmarks, achieving up to 6.5\\%\nimprovement in forecasting accuracy. In addition, we find that prime attention\nachieves comparable or superior performance using up to 40\\% less sequence\nlength compared to standard attention, further demonstrating its superior\nrelational modeling capabilities."}
