*Andreas Spilz,Heiko Oppel,Jochen Werner,Kathrin Stucke-Straub,Felix Capanni,Michael Munz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多模态数据集，用于开发和评估基于可穿戴惯性测量单元（IMUs）的运动分类模型，支持康复训练和步态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发基于IMUs的鲁棒分类模型需要大量多样化的数据集，但现有数据集成本高且耗时。

Method: 通过同步IMUs和标记式运动捕捉（MoCap）系统，收集了19名参与者的康复训练和步态数据，并提供原始和处理后的数据、工具和代码。

Result: 数据集包含IMUs和MoCap的原始数据、处理后的方向估计、OpenSim模型、逆运动学结果等，支持多种分析任务。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究，并提供工具和代码以确保可重复性。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [2] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本方法，通过处理连续视频片段和结构化元数据，无需额外训练即可预测行人意图，准确率比GPT-4V基线高18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖监督学习和大量重新训练，难以适应新场景。BF-PIP旨在提供一种无需重新训练的敏捷解决方案。

Method: 利用Gemini 2.5 Pro处理连续视频片段，结合JAAD元数据、边界框标注和自车速度，通过多模态提示推断行人意图。

Result: BF-PIP在零样本条件下达到73%的预测准确率，优于GPT-4V基线18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可提升时空感知能力，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [3] [ChartM$^3$: Benchmarking Chart Editing with Multimodal Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21167)
*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态图表编辑新范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器表达用户意图，并介绍了ChartM3基准和训练集，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的图表编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但语言模糊性限制了细粒度编辑。

Method: 引入多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示器；提出ChartM3基准和训练集ChartM3-Train。

Result: 当前多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示器理解上表现不足，但通过ChartM3-Train微调后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对构建实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为相关研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

### [4] [PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200)
*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种用于合成牙科全景X光片的生成对抗网络（GAN），旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。通过训练DCGAN并使用WGANGP损失函数，研究探索了四种候选模型，并评估了生成图像的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用DCGAN和WGANGP损失函数训练，对2322张不同质量的X光片进行预处理和清理，探索四种候选模型。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可见性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型整体清晰度更高。

Conclusion: 为未来基于GAN的牙科影像方法提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [5] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述生成）中的决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN在多模态任务中表现优异，但解释其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示生成有意义描述仍具挑战性。现有性能指标依赖与人工描述的比较，无法深入揭示模型内部机制。

Method: 通过HMLNs结合符号规则与实值函数，量化训练数据对生成描述的影响。学习训练实例的HMLN分布，并推断生成样本条件下的分布变化，识别信息丰富的训练实例。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能提供可解释的解释，并比较不同图像描述模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的HMLN框架为DNN在多模态任务中的决策提供了透明且可解释的分析工具。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

### [6] [VAGU & GtS: LLM-Based Benchmark and Framework for Joint Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21507)
*Shibo Gao,Peipei Yang,Yangyang Liu,Yi Chen,Han Zhu,Xuyao Zhang,Linlin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了VAGU基准和GtS框架，首次将视频异常检测的语义理解和时间定位任务结合，并通过JeAUG指标综合评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法仅关注时间定位或语义理解，缺乏同时支持两者的模型或数据集。

Method: 提出VAGU基准，整合异常类别、语义解释、时间定位和视频问答；设计GtS框架，通过文本提示实现粗定位和细粒度分析；提出JeAUG联合评估指标。

Result: 实验验证了VAGU、GtS和JeAUG的有效性。

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG改进了评估方式。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时空动作定位的半监督学习方法，通过双引导网络选择更好的伪边界框，显著提升了有限标注数据下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已有广泛应用，但在时空动作定位领域的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和边界框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上评估，模型在有限标注数据下表现优异，优于基于图像的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时空动作定位任务中表现出色，为半监督学习在该领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

*Shaojun E,Yuchen Yang,Jiaheng Wu,Yan Zhang,Tiejun Zhao,Ziyan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAGE框架，通过智能对齐网络（IAN）解决视觉与文本语义空间的对齐问题，显著提升多模态模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中视觉数据编码后的空间和语义损失问题，提升视觉编码器与大语言模型的耦合性。

Method: 引入IAN实现维度与语义对齐，结合交叉熵和均方误差训练策略，并开发微调数据集增强模型能力。

Result: 在多个评测基准（MME、MMBench、SEED）上表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE框架有效解决了多模态对齐问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了航空野生动物追踪中的小目标检测问题，通过数据增强和比较三种目标检测模型，发现简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪对保护工作至关重要，但存在技术挑战，如载人飞机成本高、无人机计算能力有限，以及小目标检测的困难。

Method: 采用数据增强方法（分块增强）研究模型性能，比较三种不同架构的目标检测器，并分析不同超参数对检测精度的影响。

Result: 每种模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，统计分析表明简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究支持在无人机部署中使用计算效率高的模型，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [10] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视图图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界伪影问题，并通过全景适应的扩散变换器架构提高了质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ERP格式在环境贴图中常见的极区失真和边界伪影问题，提升单视图图像估计HDR环境贴图的质量和准确性。

Method: 1. 提出ERP卷积填充以消除边界伪影；2. 设计全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，图像质量和光照准确性均与现有最优方法竞争。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了ERP格式的伪影问题，并通过PanoDiT架构提升了环境贴图的质量，尽管后者可能牺牲部分图像质量。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

*Théo Sourget,David Restrepo,Céline Hudelot,Enzo Ferrante,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类任务中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平。模型在无胸引管的病例中表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现出色，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析其在不同患者亚组（年龄、性别、种族）中的公平性，并测试对虚假相关性的鲁棒性。

Result: 不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，其他属性表现较公平；模型在无胸引管的病例中表现较差。

Conclusion: CLIP模型在医学任务中存在公平性和鲁棒性问题，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目2D摄像头实时生成高质量3D高斯重建的方法，适用于3D视频会议，无需复杂硬件或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升远程会议的临场感和参与度，解决现有3D表示方法依赖复杂硬件或固定外观的问题。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，结合稳定性损失函数，实现实时、真实且稳定的3D重建。

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上优于现有方法，并成功应用于仅需普通2D设备的3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了一种高度可访问、真实且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局到局部连接保持（GLCP）框架，用于解决管状结构分割中的结构断裂问题，通过交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和双注意力细化（DAR）模块提升分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽视局部不连续区域，导致分割结果不理想。

Method: GLCP框架结合了IMS模块（学习全局分割、骨架图和局部不连续图）和DAR模块（通过双注意力细化分割图）。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上的实验表明，GLCP在分割准确性和连续性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLCP通过同时关注全局和局部特征，显著提升了管状结构的分割效果。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否能像人类一样处理违反Grice对话原则的情况，以理解其局限性。

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰词并分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能在添加修饰词后一致下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于揭示VLMs的局限性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Motivation: 现有BEV 3D物体检测方法忽略了环境上下文信息，导致感知不全面。

Method: 提出LDO生成密集占用真值，VHS策略提取局部特征，CFF模块融合多任务知识。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到49.5% mAP和59.2% NDS，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务协作显著提升了BEV 3D检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and

TL;DR: PDAF是一个概率扩散对齐框架，通过捕捉潜在域先验来提升语义分割网络的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决域广义语义分割中因域偏移导致的模型性能下降问题。

Method: 引入潜在域先验（LDP），通过三个模块（LPE、DCM、DPE）建模和补偿域偏移。

Result: 在多样化城市场景中验证了PDAF的有效性。

Conclusion: PDAF通过概率扩散建模显著提升了模型在未见目标域中的泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但缺乏3D结构和几何一致性是主要挑战。

Method: Top2Pano通过估计体积占用推断3D结构，使用体积渲染生成粗糙的颜色和深度全景图，再通过ControlNet进行扩散式细化。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，用于多视角自动评估文本到图像生成，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的隐藏状态，并通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强文本图像相关性推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且难以训练。LLaVA-Reward旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，并引入Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强双向交互。支持配对和非配对偏好数据微调。

Result: 在文本图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估视角上，LLaVA-Reward优于传统和基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward在自动评估和推理时扩展方面表现出色，生成与人类评分一致的分数。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理阶段，训练效率提升有限，ReGATE旨在加速训练过程。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和动态评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，训练速度提升2倍，令牌减少35%，部分基准性能超越基线。

Conclusion: ReGATE高效且有效，为多模态大语言模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

Motivation: 传统地图构建模型提供确定性点估计，无法捕捉真实环境中的不确定性和模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: 利用扩散范式，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件化。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，增强了在线矢量高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性和可靠伪标签选择，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过递归总结视觉感知并自适应对齐语言命令的导航策略，解决了现有方法中场景表示过于详细和视觉-语言对齐模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言导航（VLN）代理在长序列导航决策中因场景表示过于详细和视觉-语言对齐模糊而表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出了递归视觉想象（RVI）技术，建模历史轨迹为紧凑神经网格，并采用自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，精细匹配语义。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有方法，证明了RVI和ALG技术的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过RVI和ALG技术，显著提升了VLN任务的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法能更高效地压缩数据集，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中达到最优性能，并成功扩展到多目标跟踪。

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet有效提升了光场角-时域建模能力，适用于低光场景的目标跟踪。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集3D物体检索任务中，现有方法因训练数据不足难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP的预训练特性提供了潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出DAC框架，利用CLIP和MLLM协同学习泛化3D表示，并引入AB-LoRA技术缓解过拟合。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均提升10.01% mAP，并在图像和跨数据集设置中验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的设计，显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成连贯且语义一致的烹饪过程图像上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

### [31] [Suppressing Gradient Conflict for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21530)
*Ming-Hui Liu,Harry Cheng,Xin Luo,Xin-Shun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种冲突抑制的深度伪造检测框架（CS-DFD），通过解决梯度冲突问题，提升了模型的泛化能力和检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测模型在训练数据之外的伪造技术上泛化能力不足，而联合训练原始数据和在线合成伪造数据可能导致性能下降，这与常规认知相矛盾。

Method: CS-DFD框架包含两个模块：1）更新向量搜索（UVS）模块，通过极值优化找到能同时减少各类数据损失的更新向量；2）冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，通过冲突下降损失函数惩罚梯度方向不一致，学习对齐的特征嵌入空间。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中，CS-DFD在域内检测精度和跨域泛化能力上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过显式解决梯度冲突问题，CS-DFD显著提升了深度伪造检测模型的性能，验证了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Result: 总结了现有技术，识别了研究空白，并提出了未来发展方向。

Conclusion: 太阳传感器建模与校准领域仍需进一步研究，以应对复杂的不确定性和提高传感器性能。

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模空间和语义关系，显著提升了在线高清地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

Motivation: CNN在资源受限平台上的高效部署面临挑战，现有剪枝技术忽视特征图间的结构依赖，导致剪枝决策不理想。

Method: LinDeps利用主元QR分解检测线性依赖滤波器，并通过信号恢复机制调整下一层内核，无需微调。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上，LinDeps提升了剪枝技术的压缩率并保持性能，在低资源设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是现有和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升了CNN的剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS是一种基于token自适应的偏好优化策略，通过最小化偏好损失和最大化分布偏移来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）常生成看似合理但事实错误或视觉上不准确的输出，降低了可靠性。现有的直接偏好优化（DPO）方法容易过拟合，导致分布僵化和虚假相关性。

Method: 提出TARS策略，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，最大化token级分布偏移以模拟对齐不确定性，同时最小化偏好损失。

Result: 在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优异，仅需4.8k偏好样本，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4，性能优于标准DPO并与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: TARS通过动态调整偏好优化策略，有效减少幻觉并保持视觉信息的因果相关性，为多模态推理提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向，为熟悉WSSS的研究者提供深入见解。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Motivation: 现有方法（如GAN和扩散模型）通常基于参考图像和目标年龄生成老化效果，忽略了面部区域因内在和外在因素而异的老化过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在身份保持、高保真图像生成和自然可控的老化进程方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部选择性老化实现了更真实和个性化的面部老化效果。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC（AO）分数比现有自监督方法提升超过25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注框的依赖，为视觉跟踪提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学应用中，简单且适配的模型可能比复杂模型更可靠，支持开源实现以促进相关领域发展。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升模型性能，适用于复杂场景的风力涡轮机检测。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均提升7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过领域适配和优化策略，有效提升了MLLMs在工业异常检测中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法虽无需训练，但缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致或视觉不合理。

Method: GuidPaint在去噪过程中引入分类器引导，结合随机和确定性采样，实现对掩码区域的精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估上均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint通过训练无关的类别引导，显著提升了图像修复的质量和可控性。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) aims to identify and ground anomalous behaviors
or events in videos, serving as a core technology in the fields of intelligent
surveillance and public safety. With the advancement of deep learning, the
continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene
adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding
application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal
large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new
opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and
LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The
surge in publications and the evolution of tasks have created an urgent need
for systematic reviews of recent advancements. This paper presents the first
comprehensive survey analyzing VAD methods based on MLLMs and LLMs, providing
an in-depth discussion of the changes occurring in the VAD field in the era of
large models and their underlying causes. Additionally, this paper proposes a
unified framework that encompasses both deep neural network (DNN)-based and
LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms
empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

*Cameron Trotter,Huw Griffiths,Tasnuva Ming Khan,Rowan Whittle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对南极底栖生物监测的定制化目标检测框架，解决了海洋生态图像分析中的关键挑战，并展示了在多类生物检测中的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监测南极底栖生物多样性对理解气候变化驱动的生态变化至关重要，但传统手动标注方法效率低下，阻碍大规模分析。

Method: 结合分辨率保持的分块、空间数据增强、微调和Slicing Aided Hyper Inference后处理，构建了一个目标检测框架。

Result: 在25种细粒度形态类型的检测中表现优异，但对小型和稀有类群的检测仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来机器辅助的底栖生物多样性监测研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT框架通过统计匹配和尺度感知调度解决了基于补丁方法的分布偏移和单调性问题，提升了高分辨率图像生成的细节和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的方法在高分辨率图像生成中存在分布偏移和单调性问题，限制了生成质量。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合统计匹配和尺度感知调度，优化补丁分布和去噪路径。

Result: APT生成更清晰的高分辨率图像，同时加快采样速度。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像去标识化框架，通过分步处理实现隐私保护与医学语义保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去标识化方法未能兼顾医学语义保留和隐私级别灵活调整。

Method: 采用分步框架：1) 身份区域屏蔽；2) 利用预训练医学基础模型补偿语义；3) 基于最小描述长度原则的特征解耦。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护和医学语义保留方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光吸收、散射、海洋生物和碎片等导致视觉退化，增强图像对路径检测和自主导航等下游任务至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为比较水下图像增强方法提供了鲁棒且实用的基准，验证了其在真实水下场景中的适用性。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测变换器）的可解释性和透明度，填补对内部组件作用理解的研究空白。

Method: 采用神经科学中的消融研究方法，系统分析三种检测变换器模型的关键组件（如查询嵌入、注意力层）对性能的影响。

Result: 发现模型特定的鲁棒性模式：DETR对编码器和解码器注意力层敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布规则最鲁棒。还揭示了结构冗余。

Conclusion: 研究推进了检测变换器的可解释性，明确了内部组件的作用，为优化透明度和效率提供了见解。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMITE模型基于SAM2改进，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决目标遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VOT方法忽视时间依赖或泛化性差，且无法有效处理遮挡和干扰。

Method: 引入原型记忆库量化跟踪结果正确性，生成位置提示减少干扰。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE有效拦截错误传播，提升跟踪准确性。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，通过学习类别无关的差异表示，解决了现有细粒度图像检索方法因依赖预定义类别而泛化能力受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别学习判别表示，导致表示中引入类别特定语义，限制了模型对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务，结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，通过知识蒸馏将类别无关表示迁移到检索模型。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过学习类别无关的差异表示，显著提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，仅需少量示例即可显著提升模型性能，适用于数据稀缺的领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言和视觉语言模型在专业领域（如遥感）中因标注数据稀缺而难以应用的问题。

Method: 采用1-shot RLVR框架，通过策略梯度优化和轻量级规则奖励（如IoU）训练模型，无需标注监督。

Result: 实验表明，仅需一个示例即可显著提升性能，128个示例可媲美数千标注样本训练的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大、延迟高，不适用于资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低了计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出MoR-ViT框架，采用动态递归机制，使每个token自适应确定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现SOTA准确率，参数减少70%，推理加速2.5倍。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为实际部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 微表情AUs检测是情感计算中的关键挑战，但现有方法在数据稀缺和低强度领域表现不佳。LLMs具有强大的推理能力，但尚未应用于微表情AUs检测。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议测试，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的潜力和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本和跨域泛化任务中表现出色，且计算高效。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该模型显著提升了医学图像-文本预训练的效果，能够更好地捕捉临床语义和不确定性。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world

advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Motivation: 尽管在内容审核和对齐方面取得了进展，但大型语言模型和文本到图像系统仍容易受到提示攻击（越狱）。这些攻击通常由非专家用户设计，绕过安全机制。

Method: 通过多轮叙事升级、词汇伪装、暗示链、虚构冒充和微妙语义编辑等技术，对流行的API进行实证案例研究，提出统一的越狱策略分类。

Result: 研究发现，从输入过滤到输出验证的每个审核阶段都可以被非专家用户绕过。

Conclusion: 论文强调需要开发上下文感知的防御方法，以应对现实中易于复制的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

### [60] [Cross-Architecture Distillation Made Simple with Redundancy Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21844)
*Weijia Zhang,Yuehao Liu,Wu Ran,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过抑制冗余信息实现知识迁移，避免了复杂模块和参数过载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因引入复杂模块和架构定制设计而效率低下，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，包括跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计轻量模块解耦RSD目标与学生内部表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试中优于OFA方法，且参数开销更小。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，可作为跨架构知识蒸馏的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

### [61] [Unleashing the Power of Motion and Depth: A Selective Fusion Strategy for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21857)
*Jiahao He,Daerji Suolang,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），用于RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化光流和深度的融合，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在利用光流和深度时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SMFNet框架，包含PSF策略和MSAM模块，选择性融合光流和深度，并与RGB模态多维度整合。

Result: 在RDVS和DVisal数据集上全面评估，SMFNet优于19种先进模型，并在合成深度视频数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合策略和多维注意力模块，显著提升了RGB-D VSOD的性能。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

TL;DR: Vid-TTA是一个轻量级的测试时自适应框架，通过自监督辅助任务优化视频编辑，提升时间一致性和减少提示过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频编辑中时间不一致性和提示过拟合的问题，同时减少计算资源需求。

Method: 采用运动感知帧重建机制和提示扰动重建策略，结合元学习动态损失平衡。

Result: 显著提升视频时间一致性，减少过拟合，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供了即插即用的性能提升方案。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时效果不佳，且单一方向假设（如头部到指尖）可能导致性能下降。

Method: 提出双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖的方向；引入高斯射线热图表示和CLIP感知指向集成模块；增加对象中心预测头作为辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下性能提升约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成显著提升了指向性参考理解的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Motivation: 克服传统顺序文本到视觉管道的局限性，实现更一致和沉浸式的多模态叙事生成。

Method: 框架包含Narrator（生成文本和提示）、Director（管理动态场景图）、Narrative Arc Controller（指导故事结构）和Affective Tone Mapper（确保情感一致性）。

Result: 在多样化叙事提示的定性评估中，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有检测器在真实场景中的有效性尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试方法，使用先进深度伪造生成技术创建包含50万张高质量伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 检测深度伪造仍具挑战性，半数检测器的AUC得分低于60%，基本图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测需进一步改进，现有方法在真实场景中表现不足。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

Motivation: 数字化艺术品的分析需要视觉解释和丰富的艺术、历史背景知识，现有方法依赖外部链接，限制了适用范围。

Method: ArtSeek包含多模态检索模块、对比多任务分类网络和代理推理策略，利用WikiFragments数据集支持知识推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得最佳成绩，如风格分类F1提高8.4%，ArtPedia上的标题生成BLEU@1提高7.1。

Conclusion: ArtSeek能解释视觉主题、推断历史背景，适用于其他需要外部知识的领域，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Motivation: 眼底图像分析面临小病灶区域和疾病间差异细微的挑战，导致模型预测精度下降和过拟合。

Method: 结合Shifted Window (Swin) Attention和Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)机制，提出SwinECAT模型，增强特征表示能力。

Result: 在包含16,140张眼底图像的EDID数据集上，SwinECAT达到88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类分类任务中表现优异，显著优于基线模型，是目前公开数据集上的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Motivation: 多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建数据集：1) 收集公开多模态数据集；2) 使用GPT-4o生成理由并整合API调用和RAG；3) 通过反思优化理由；4) 可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在多个基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效建模多模态线索（如音乐）或忽略跨模态协作和时间动态，导致对复杂交互和关键性能变化的捕捉不足。

Method: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制对齐多模态特征，结合视觉和音频信息，并引入局部查询编码模块和两级评分评估。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上的实验表明，LMAC-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和特征增强，有效提升了长期动作质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

<details>

Motivation: 解决数据自由量化（DFQ）中合成图像与量化模型泛化性关系未充分探索的问题，避免单类提示导致的性能下降。

Method: 使用mixup-class prompt策略，融合多个类别标签生成合成数据，并通过梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量见解。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低位量化（W2A4）中取得新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了PTQ的性能，尤其在低比特量化场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation

Motivation: 现有阴影去除方法依赖阴影掩码，但实际场景中掩码难以获取。利用局部对比信息等内在图像线索存在模糊性问题，难以区分真实阴影与低反射物体及复杂背景。

Method: 提出AGBA机制动态过滤和重加权对比先验，分离阴影特征；引入FCFN网络，利用高频和对比线索指导生成过程，恢复软阴影边界和细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优效果，并与基于掩码的方法性能相当。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN有效解决了阴影去除中的掩码依赖和模糊性问题，提升了复杂场景下的性能。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现偏差问题，提升了分割质量。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Result: PanoSplatt3R在无姿态信息的情况下，显著优于现有方法，生成高质量新视角和准确深度估计。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了在实际应用中的巨大潜力，尤其在无姿态信息场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度学习框架，用于将心电图图像分类为五种主要诊断类别，解决了图像噪声和波形细节检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，心电图（ECG）是关键诊断工具，但传统人工解读耗时且依赖专家知识。现有研究多关注数字信号，而临床中ECG多为图像形式，需填补这一空白。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少视觉噪声，并设计两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部ECG图像数据集上微调学习领域特征，再在目标数据集上微调以增强疾病识别。使用ConvNeXt架构作为模型主干。

Result: 在英国心脏基金会开放数据科学挑战赛中，公开验证集和私有测试集的AUROC分数分别为0.9688和0.9677。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了作为临床工作流程中自动化ECG解读工具的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但在稀疏噪声事件流中提取可靠特征以及与密集图像数据融合仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包含自适应事件特征优化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM）。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件语义分割中的特征提取和模态融合问题。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有微动作识别方法往往忽略微动作中的细微变化，导致识别精度受限。

Method: 设计了运动引导骨架调制模块（MSM）和运动引导时间调制模块（MTM），并结合多尺度特征的运动一致性学习策略。

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 显式建模细微运动线索对提升微动作识别性能至关重要。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Method: 提出ZIUM，支持零样本对抗攻击，无需额外优化，可灵活定制目标攻击图像以反映攻击者意图。

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高，且对已攻击概念的攻击时间显著减少。

Conclusion: ZIUM为对抗攻击提供高效、灵活的解决方案，显著提升攻击效率和意图对齐能力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法来标记和锁定计算机视觉模型，以保护知识产权，无需微调或重新训练，并提供可计算的保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现标记和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入触发补丁解锁。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，对模型性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 新方法为模型保护提供了高效且可验证的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Motivation: 工业烟雾分割对空气质量监测至关重要，但像素级标注成本高且稀缺，需要一种低成本、高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出CEDANet框架，利用公民提供的视频级弱标签和对抗特征对齐，通过伪标签优化和类特定域判别器实现领域适应。

Result: 在SMOKE5K和IJmond数据集上，F1分数提升5倍，烟雾类IoU提升6倍，接近全监督模型性能。

Conclusion: CEDANet验证了公民科学与弱监督领域适应的可扩展性和成本效益，为数据稀缺的环境监测提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现与视觉内容不一致的幻觉现象，现有方法多为文本中心，效果有限。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像和构建视觉指令，增强模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，改善视觉语义对齐。

Result: 实验表明，ViHallu显著提升了模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，并减少了幻觉倾向。

Conclusion: ViHallu通过视觉中心的方法有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，并发布了相关数据集ViHallu-Instruction。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Conclusion: 密集标记路由在低资源环境中更具决定性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 现有导航基础模型仅依赖离线数据，缺乏对动作后果的推理能力，难以适应真实世界中的交互需求。

Result: S2E在NavBench-GS基准测试中表现出色，缓解了仅依赖离线数据的性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 强化学习在机器人学习中至关重要，结合在线交互经验能有效扩展基础模型能力。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Result: 在三个FGFSL基准测试中，LCN-4显著优于基于ConvNet-4的方法，并与ResNet12方法性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 浅层网络通过适当设计（如LCN-4）可以在FGFSL中达到甚至超越深层网络的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and

yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合强化学习的自回归模型X-Omni，用于解决图像生成中的视觉保真度低、输出扭曲等问题，实现了图像与语言生成的无缝整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于离散令牌的自回归图像生成方法存在视觉保真度低、输出扭曲等问题，且难以处理复杂指令。论文旨在通过强化学习提升生成质量。

Method: 提出X-Omni框架，包括语义图像分词器、统一的自回归模型和离线扩散解码器，结合强化学习优化生成过程。

Result: X-Omni在图像生成任务中达到SOTA性能，生成图像具有高美学质量，并能有效遵循指令和渲染长文本。

Conclusion: 强化学习可显著改善自回归模型的图像生成质量，X-Omni框架为图像与语言生成提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

TL;DR: StepAL是一种主动学习框架，针对手术视频步骤识别设计，通过全视频选择和熵加权聚类策略，减少标注成本并保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法针对图像或短视频设计，不适用于长手术视频的步骤识别，因为需要上下文标注。

Method: StepAL结合步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样化的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现更高准确率。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供高效解决方案，降低标注负担，助力计算机辅助手术系统开发。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 作者提出了Decoupled Motion Appearance Network (DMA)，一种基线方法，用于解决运动引导的FSVOS任务。

Result: 实验表明，DMA在少样本运动理解任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了运动引导FSVOS的空白，为未来研究提供了基础和方向。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: MetaCLIP 2是一种从全球网络数据中训练CLIP模型的新方法，解决了多语言数据处理的挑战，并在零样本分类和多语言基准测试中取得了新的最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP模型在处理多语言数据时的局限性，包括数据点处理不足和英语性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出MetaCLIP 2，通过最小化必要改动，实现英语和非英语数据的互惠学习。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中超越现有模型，并在多语言基准测试中创下新纪录。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2为多语言CLIP训练提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Motivation: 探索承诺在博弈论中超越实现高效均衡的潜在应用，研究如何通过非强制手段利用承诺进行利润提取。

Method: 引入顺序性到同时行动博弈中，设计基于结果相关支付的非强制敲诈机制，分析其成功条件和适用范围。

Result: 确定了敲诈成功的条件、易受影响的博弈类别、最大可提取利润和最小支付要求，并在2x2博弈中验证了机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了对承诺的理解，揭示了竞争环境中的战略漏洞，对经济市场、外交关系和多智能体系统具有重要启示。

Abstract: Commitments play a crucial role in game theory, shaping strategic
interactions by either altering a player's own payoffs or influencing the
incentives of others through outcome-contingent payments. While most research
has focused on using commitments to achieve efficient equilibria, their
potential applications beyond this goal remain largely unexplored. In this
study, we introduce a non-coercive extortion mechanism that leverages
commitments to outcome-contingent payments, demonstrating how a player or
external agent can extract profit by offering rewards rather than threatening
punishment. At the core of the mechanism is the introduction of sequentiality
into a simultaneous-move game, fundamentally reshaping the strategic
interaction. We derive the conditions under which extortion is successful,
identify the class of games susceptible to this scheme, and determine both the
maximum extractable profit and the minimum required payment. To illustrate the
extortion mechanism, we apply it to 2x2 games, highlighting how even simple
strategic settings can be vulnerable to this form of manipulation. Our results
reveal strategic vulnerabilities in competitive settings, with significant
implications for economic markets, diplomatic relations, and multi-agent
systems operating in blockchain environments. This work broadens our
understanding of commitments in game theory and raises critical questions about
how to safeguard strategic interactions from exploitation through non-coercive
extortion.

Conclusion: Sync-TVA通过动态增强和跨模态融合有效提升了多模态情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally
intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However,
existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced
contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA,
an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic
enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a
dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous
cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual
features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for
robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and
weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.

Result: 纹理JND小于几何JND，颜色丰富度与纹理JND相关，但与几何JND无关。点数量与JND无关。

Conclusion: 提出了PC-JND数据集，为未来感知优化研究提供支持。

Abstract: The Just Noticeable Difference (JND) accounts for the minimum distortion at
which humans can perceive a difference between a pristine stimulus and its
distorted version. The JND concept has been widely applied in visual signal
processing tasks, including coding, transmission, rendering, and quality
assessment, to optimize human-centric media experiences. A point cloud is a
mainstream volumetric data representation consisting of both geometry
information and attributes (e.g. color). Point clouds are used for advanced
immersive 3D media such as Virtual Reality (VR). However, the JND
characteristics of viewing point clouds in VR have not been explored before. In
this paper, we study the point cloud-wise JND (PCJND) characteristics in a Six
Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) VR environment using a head-mounted display. Our
findings reveal that the texture PCJND of human eyes is smaller than the
geometry PCJND for most point clouds. Furthermore, we identify a correlation
between colorfulness and texture PCJND. However, there is no significant
correlation between colorfulness and the geometry PCJND, nor between the number
of points and neither the texture or geometry PCJND. To support future research
in JND prediction and perception-driven signal processing, we introduce PC-JND,
a novel point cloud-based JND dataset. This dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate advancements in perceptual optimization for immersive
media.

Abstract: Motion compensation is a key component of video codecs. Conventional codecs
(HEVC and VVC) have carefully refined this coding step, with an important focus
on sub-pixel motion compensation. On the other hand, learned codecs achieve
sub-pixel motion compensation through simple bilinear filtering. This paper
offers to improve learned codec motion compensation by drawing inspiration from
conventional codecs. It is shown that the usage of more advanced interpolation
filters, block-based motion information and finite motion accuracy lead to
better compression performance and lower decoding complexity. Experimental
results are provided on the Cool-chic video codec, where we demonstrate a rate
decrease of more than 10% and a lowering of motion-related decoding complexity
from 391 MAC per pixel to 214 MAC per pixel. All contributions are made

TL;DR: 论文研究了Steiner Orientation问题的复杂性，发现其在多种结构参数下表现异常困难，并提供了相关算法和复杂性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Steiner Orientation问题在不同结构参数（如树宽、路径宽等）下的计算复杂性，以理解其难度并提供有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用结构参数化复杂性理论，分析问题在不同参数（如反馈顶点数、树宽、顶点覆盖数等）下的复杂性，并提出相应的算法。

Result: 证明问题在多种参数下是NP完全的，并提供了XP算法和FPT算法，同时验证了这些算法的复杂性边界。

Conclusion: Steiner Orientation问题在结构参数化复杂性框架下表现出较高的难度，但通过特定参数化方法仍可找到有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the \textsc{Steiner Orientation} problem, where we are given as
input a mixed graph $G=(V,E,A)$ and a set of $k$ demand pairs $(s_i,t_i)$,
$i\in[k]$. The goal is to orient the undirected edges of $G$ in a way that the
resulting directed graph has a directed path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ for all
$i\in[k]$. We adopt the point of view of structural parameterized complexity
and investigate the complexity of \textsc{Steiner Orientation} for standard
measures, such as treewidth. Our results indicate that \textsc{Steiner
Orientation} is a surprisingly hard problem from this point of view. In
particular, our main contributions are the following: (1) We show that
\textsc{Steiner Orientation} is NP-complete on instances where the underlying
graph has feedback vertex number 2, treewidth 2, pathwidth 3, and vertex
integrity 6; (2) We present an XP algorithm parameterized by vertex cover
number $\mathrm{vc}$ of complexity $n^{\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{vc}^2)}$.
Furthermore, we show that this running time is essentially optimal by proving
that a running time of $n^{o(\mathrm{vc}^2)}$ would refute the ETH; (3) We
consider parameterizations by the number of undirected or directed edges ($|E|$
or $|A|$) and we observe that the trivial $2^{|E|}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time
algorithm for the former parameter is optimal under the SETH. Complementing
this, we show that the problem admits a
$2^{\mathcal{O}(|A|)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time algorithm. In addition to the
above, we consider the complexity of \textsc{Steiner Orientation} parameterized
by $\mathrm{tw}+k$ (FPT), distance to clique (FPT), and $\mathrm{vc}+k$ (FPT
with a polynomial kernel).

Motivation: 研究在线边着色问题，探索如何超越贪心算法的限制，尤其是在高最大度数图中。

Method: 提出了确定性算法和随机算法，分别针对不同最大度数范围（ω(log n)和ω(√log n)）实现(1 + o(1))Δ着色。

Result: 确定性算法在Δ = ω(log n)时实现(1 + o(1))Δ着色；随机算法在Δ = ω(√log n)时实现相同结果。

Conclusion: 研究确定了贪心算法可以被超越的阈值，并证明了确定性算法和随机算法的性能接近最优。

Abstract: Vizing's theorem guarantees that every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$
admits an edge coloring using $\Delta + 1$ colors. In online settings - where
edges arrive one at a time and must be colored immediately - a simple greedy
algorithm uses at most $2\Delta - 1$ colors. Over thirty years ago, Bar-Noy,
Motwani, and Naor [IPL'92] proved that this guarantee is optimal among
deterministic algorithms when $\Delta = O(\log n)$, and among randomized
algorithms when $\Delta = O(\sqrt{\log n})$. While deterministic improvements
seemed out of reach, they conjectured that for graphs with $\Delta =
\omega(\log n)$, randomized algorithms can achieve $(1 + o(1))\Delta$ edge
coloring. This conjecture was recently resolved in the affirmative: a $(1 +
o(1))\Delta$-coloring is achievable online using randomization for all graphs
with $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$ [BSVW STOC'24].
  Our results go further, uncovering two findings not predicted by the original
conjecture. First, we give a deterministic online algorithm achieving $(1 +
o(1))\Delta$-colorings for all $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$. Second, we give a
randomized algorithm achieving $(1 + o(1))\Delta$-colorings already when
$\Delta = \omega(\sqrt{\log n})$. Our results establish sharp thresholds for
when greedy can be surpassed, and near-optimal guarantees can be achieved -
matching the impossibility results of [BNMN IPL'92], both deterministically and
randomly.

Conclusion: 论文解决了ccdh近似问题的复杂度，为子线性模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: The degree distribution of a graph $G=(V,E)$, $|V|=n$, $|E|=m$ is one of the
most fundamental objects of study in the analysis of graphs as it embodies
relationship among entities. In particular, an important derived distribution
from degree distribution is the complementary cumulative degree histogram
(ccdh). The ccdh is a fundamental summary of graph structure, capturing, for
each threshold $d$, the number of vertices with degree at least $d$. For
approximating ccdh, we consider the $(\varepsilon_D,\varepsilon_R)$-BiCriteria
Multiplicative Approximation, which allows for controlled multiplicative slack
in both the domain and the range. The exact complexity of the problem was not
known and had been posed as an open problem in WOLA 2019 [Sublinear.info,
Problem 98].
  In this work, we first design an algorithm that can approximate ccdh if a
suitable vertex sample and an edge sample can be obtained and thus, the
algorithm is independent of any sublinear model. Next, we show that in the
streaming and query models, these samples can be obtained efficiently. On the
other end, we establish the first lower bounds for this problem in both query
and streaming models, and (almost) settle the complexity of the problem across
both the sublinear models.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在持续学习中存在的灾难性遗忘问题，借鉴人类学习策略（如主动回忆、刻意练习和间隔重复）来改进模型。

Method: 引入Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR)方法，结合Active Recall Probe机制，定期评估模型记忆以稳定过去知识的表示。

Result: 在Split MNIST和Split CIFAR-100基准测试中，TFC-SR显著优于其他方法，例如在Split CIFAR-100上达到13.17%的准确率，而标准回放方法仅为7.40%。

Conclusion: TFC-SR是一种高效且稳健的持续学习方法，强调了在持续学习系统中整合主动记忆检索机制的重要性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as
quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our
understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于独立性准则的无监督和监督降维方法，在对比度、准确性和可解释性上优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖核函数捕捉数据的非线性结构，但需专家确保非线性最大化数据多样性。本文旨在设计更优的独立性准则以改进降维方法。

Method: 提出了3种独立性准则，并基于此设计了无监督和监督降维方法，在线性和非线性设置下评估性能。

Result: 方法在对比度、准确性和可解释性上优于基线方法（如tSNE、PCA、VAE等）。

Conclusion: 该方法为可解释机器学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for
the researchers.

Method: 采用对比学习框架，提出一种新的基于形态学的课程对比学习方法，以增强动态特征的潜在表示，并减少区域多样性带来的问题。

Result: 实验分析表明，该方法能够在不影响性能的情况下使用更小的补丁尺寸，并有效应对数据不平衡和高维挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为野火预测提供了一种高效且计算成本较低的解决方案，适用于复杂时空数据的处理。

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep unfolding neural network-based MIMO detector
that incorporates complex-valued computations using Wirtinger calculus. The
method, referred as Dynamic Partially Shrinkage Thresholding (DPST), enables
efficient, interpretable, and low-complexity MIMO signal detection. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on real-valued approximations, our method operates
natively in the complex domain, aligning with the fundamental nature of signal
processing tasks. The proposed algorithm requires only a small number of
trainable parameters, allowing for simplified training. Numerical results

Conclusion: 本文为有限容量下学习的系统理论研究提供了初步成果。

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

demonstrates that the DRL-optimized system achieves a 38\% reduction in energy
costs, significantly outperforming traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL)
methods (28\%) and heuristic approaches (22\%). Additionally, it maintains a
low SLA violation rate of 1.5\%, compared to 3.0\% for RL and 4.8\% for
heuristic methods. The DRL-optimized approach also results in an 82\%
improvement in energy efficiency, surpassing other methods, and a 45\%
reduction in carbon emissions, making it the most environmentally friendly

Conclusion: SPADE-S有效解决了时间序列预测中的异质性问题，显著提升了预测准确性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,
respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to

Conclusion: 本文填补了现有文献中对OOD数据分布偏移研究的空白。

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过紧密耦合表示学习和一类支持向量机（OCSVM）来解决无监督异常检测的挑战，并在MNIST-C和脑MRI任务中验证了其性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督异常检测（UAD）在缺乏标记数据的情况下检测异常，现有方法存在重建异常或特征空间不优的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过自定义损失函数将潜在特征与OCSVM决策边界对齐，紧密耦合表示学习和OCSVM。

Result: 在MNIST-C和脑MRI任务中表现出色，尤其针对小、非高信号病变，展现了鲁棒性和临床相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法在UAD和医学影像应用中具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve
reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to
4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems
from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of
intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems
as a vital frontier for capability emergence.

Motivation: 高性能机器学习模型（如XGBoost）缺乏可解释性，限制了其在临床中的应用。本研究旨在为肌肉减少症风险评估提供一种兼具预测准确性和透明性的解决方案。

Method: 提出LAI-ML框架，利用HAGA和CACS技术将XGBoost的特征归因转化为概率形式，并通过LLM生成数据可信的诊断叙述。

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法（如DPO）将偏好学习视为最大似然估计问题，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致性能不足。

Method: MaPPO通过最大后验估计目标整合先验奖励知识，无需额外超参数，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MaPPO显著提升了模型对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化框架，能够持续改进现有方法。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

Motivation: 临床LLMs在静态基准测试中表现良好，但在输入微小变化（如症状掩盖或否定）时表现不稳定，而标准NLP指标无法检测这些潜在问题。

Method: 提出LAPD框架，通过结构化对抗编辑（如掩盖、否定、同义词替换和数值变化）生成临床笔记，并计算PCA降维潜在空间中的LDFR。

Result: 研究发现，即使输入表面变化极小，临床LLMs仍表现出潜在脆弱性，且在真实临床笔记中验证了LDFR的普适性。

Conclusion: 几何感知的评估在安全关键临床AI中至关重要，揭示了表面鲁棒性与语义稳定性之间的差距。

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

TL;DR: EdgeAgentX-DT扩展了EdgeAgentX框架，通过数字孪生和生成式AI增强军事网络边缘智能，提升训练和验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升军事网络边缘智能的鲁棒性和性能，以应对复杂和对抗性环境。

Method: 结合数字孪生同步和生成式AI（扩散模型和Transformer）进行多场景模拟训练，采用多层架构（边缘智能、数字孪生同步、生成式训练）。

Result: 实验显示学习收敛更快、网络吞吐量更高、延迟更低、抗干扰和节点故障能力更强。

Conclusion: 数字孪生和生成式训练能有效增强边缘AI在复杂环境中的部署能力。

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework
that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario
training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks.
EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of
digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in
contested environments.

*Ling Liao,Eva Aagaard*

TL;DR: AdaptHetero是一个基于机器学习解释的框架，通过整合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，为医院系统中的子群体提供定制化建模指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）数据的复杂性和异质性限制了机器学习解释在子群体建模中的有效性，因此需要一种方法将解释性转化为实际指导。

Method: 提出AdaptHetero框架，结合SHAP解释和无监督聚类，分析EHR数据中的子群体特征。

Result: 在三个大型EHR数据集上验证，AdaptHetero能有效识别ICU死亡率、院内死亡和隐性低氧血症的异质性模型行为，并提升预测性能。

Conclusion: AdaptHetero通过解释性驱动的子群体建模，显著提升了EHR数据的预测效果和临床意义。

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对语言模型的梯度反转攻击方法Grab，通过混合优化显著提高了私有训练数据的恢复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管梯度反转攻击在视觉模型中已被证明是联邦学习的隐私威胁，但在语言模型中其威胁被低估。本文旨在揭示语言模型中该攻击的实际风险。

Method: 提出Grab方法，结合交替优化过程：层间dropout掩码的同步优化和离散优化，以解决文本数据的离散性挑战。

Result: Grab在基准和实际设置中分别实现了高达92.9%和48.5%的恢复率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Grab为理解语言模型联邦学习中的隐私威胁提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多个LLMs处理IMAs，效率低且不灵活。本文旨在通过单一LLM实现多样IMAs，提升适应性和效率。

Method: 提出ContextLoRA方法，通过任务依赖图指导LLM学习IMAs的结构化上下文，并开发ContextGear调度策略优化训练过程。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优越，并在真实无线测试平台上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在单一LLM上实现了多样IMAs的高效适应，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据分布不均衡且标注有限，传统算法表现不佳，需开发鲁棒算法以扩展深度学习应用。

Method: 分为四部分：1) 长尾数据生成模型；2) 归纳正则化提升尾部类泛化；3) 半监督学习优化指标；4) 高效域适应。

Result: 算法在长尾数据生成、泛化能力、半监督学习和域适应方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过四种算法，实现了从有限和不完美数据中高效学习，扩展了深度学习在现实场景的应用。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: Bubbleformer是一种基于Transformer的时空模型，能够自主预测沸腾动力学，无需依赖模拟数据，并在多相沸腾流中取得新的基准结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理时需要未来输入，且无法从过去状态学习成核现象，限制了自主预测沸腾动力学的能力。此外，现有模型未能有效建模流动沸腾速度场。

Method: Bubbleformer采用因子化轴向注意力、频率感知缩放，并结合热物理参数条件化，以泛化不同流体、几何和操作条件。

Result: Bubbleformer在预测和预报两相沸腾流方面取得了新的基准结果，并提出了基于物理的可解释性评估指标。

Conclusion: Bubbleformer通过创新的模型设计和数据集支持，显著提升了沸腾动力学的建模能力。

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在整合多源噪声实验数据时需要精确噪声水平和手动调参的问题。

Method: 提出Adam-PnP框架，结合自适应噪声估计和动态模态加权机制，指导预训练扩散模型。

Result: 在复杂重建任务中显著提高了准确性。

Conclusion: Adam-PnP为蛋白质结构恢复提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

Method: 将PCE与概率电路结合，提出DeepPCE，以扩展至高维输入空间。

Result: DeepPCE预测性能与多层感知机（MLP）相当，同时保留PCE的统计推断能力。

Conclusion: DeepPCE是一种高效的高维问题解决方案，兼具预测性能和统计推断能力。

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统通常过于关注点击相关性，忽视了多样性和新颖性，而现有强化学习方法依赖随机探索，可能不符合用户兴趣。

Method: LAAC利用LLM作为参考策略提出新颖项目，通过轻量级策略优化这些建议，采用双层优化训练演员和评论家网络，并引入正则化避免LLM建议的过度估计。

Result: 实验表明，LAAC在多样性和新颖性上优于现有基线，同时在准确性上表现良好，且无需昂贵的微调。

Conclusion: LAAC有效整合了LLM知识，提升了推荐系统的多样性和新颖性，适用于不平衡数据。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

Result: 在数据丰富、稀缺甚至FOM参数错误的情况下，混合方法相比纯数据方法显著提升了时间序列预测能力。

Conclusion: 混合方法在多种场景下均优于纯数据方法，展示了结合物理模型与数据驱动的潜力。

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

Result: 方法提高了模拟精度和结果可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为弹性物体的重建和模拟提供了一种高效且物理一致的方法。

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

Result: 在UCR Archive和模拟数据集上，CDNet显著提升了现有深度学习分类器的性能。

Conclusion: CDNet在挑战性数据条件下优于现有方法，为时间序列分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

Motivation: 现有方法多关注单车辆VRP，忽视了多车辆的MMHCVRP，且解码决策短视，未能利用问题的关键特性。

Method: ECHO采用双模态节点编码器捕捉局部拓扑关系，参数无关交叉注意力机制减少短视决策，并利用数据增强策略稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明ECHO在车辆和节点数量变化时优于现有方法，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 消融研究验证了所提方法的有效性，ECHO为MMHCVRP提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

<details>

Motivation: 传统神经网络（如RNN、CNN和Transformer）在处理长序列时存在内存保留限制，而SSMs虽然能处理长序列，但计算和内存需求高，需要专用硬件支持。

Method: 设计了基于脉动阵列（SAs）的EpochCore加速器，引入LIMA-PE处理单元和ProDF数据流，优化SSM模型的执行效率。

Conclusion: EpochCore为SSM模型提供了高效的硬件支持，显著提升了长序列任务的推理性能。

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an

TL;DR: LIT-PCBA基准数据集存在严重的数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，导致其无法公平评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LIT-PCBA数据集在虚拟筛选基准测试中的缺陷，以提醒社区注意数据质量问题。

Method: 通过审计数据集，识别数据泄漏、重复和结构冗余问题，并设计一个简单的记忆基线模型验证这些缺陷的影响。

Result: 发现大量数据重复和泄漏，记忆基线模型甚至优于现有先进模型，说明数据集无法支持公平评估。

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA数据集不适合作为基准，呼吁开发更严谨的数据集。

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扭矩的分层重布线策略，通过动态调整消息传递来改进异质图表示学习并增强对噪声图的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNNs）在原生图结构中的消息传递可能不够高效，尤其是在异质图和噪声图中表现不佳。

Method: 定义了一种干扰感知的扭矩度量，结合结构距离和能量分数，量化边的扰动，并通过分层修剪高扭矩边和添加低扭矩链接来重构感受野。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在异质图和同质图上均优于现有方法，并在噪声图上保持高精度。

Conclusion: 提出的扭矩驱动分层重布线策略有效提升了GNNs在异质图和噪声图上的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

TL;DR: MemShare是一种新型KV缓存管理方法，通过识别可重用的KV缓存块，显著减少内存开销并提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中生成冗长的思维链序列，导致内存开销大，且中间推理步骤高度相似。

Method: 提出MemShare，采用协同过滤算法识别可重用的KV缓存块，并实现零拷贝缓存重用。

Result: 实验显示，MemShare在保持准确性的同时，吞吐量提升高达84.79%。

Conclusion: MemShare有效减少内存开销，提升性能，优于现有KV缓存管理方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新框架PVD-Net和PVD-ONet，用于解决奇异摄动问题，无需数据，仅依赖控制方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理信息神经网络在奇异摄动问题中难以收敛的问题。

Method: PVD-Net采用双网络架构（稳定优先）和五网络架构（高精度优先）；PVD-ONet通过多个DeepONet模块推广到算子学习。

Result: 数值实验表明，新方法在多种误差指标下优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 为多尺度问题提供了一种强大的新方法。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAGDP提出了一种无需额外训练的框架，通过知识库加速预训练扩散策略的推理，提高了准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略（DPs）在模仿学习任务中表现优异，但生成动作耗时较长；现有知识蒸馏方法（如CP）训练时间长。

Method: RAGDP通过构建专家演示的向量数据库，结合中间噪声去除步骤，减少推理步骤。

Result: RAGDP在20倍加速下仍保持准确性优势，比CP提高7%。

Conclusion: RAGDP在无需额外训练的情况下，显著提升了扩散策略的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

TL;DR: Latte是一个新颖的框架，用于解决分布式学习中的测试时适应问题，通过本地和外部内存存储历史数据，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法在分布式环境中因数据有限或缺乏个性化而表现不佳。

Method: 每个客户端维护本地和外部内存，通过服务器协调获取相似客户端的原型数据，利用嵌入相似性和不确定性进行本地适应。

Result: Latte在分布式环境中表现优异，同时通信和计算成本极低。

Conclusion: Latte有效解决了分布式测试时适应问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents has opened new frontiers in AI applications, yet
evaluating these agents remains a complex and underdeveloped area. This survey
provides an in-depth overview of the emerging field of LLM agent evaluation,
introducing a two-dimensional taxonomy that organizes existing work along (1)
evaluation objectives -- what to evaluate, such as agent behavior,
capabilities, reliability, and safety -- and (2) evaluation process -- how to
evaluate, including interaction modes, datasets and benchmarks, metric
computation methods, and tooling. In addition to taxonomy, we highlight
enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable
evaluation. This work aims to bring clarity to the fragmented landscape of
agent evaluation and provide a framework for systematic assessment, enabling
researchers and practitioners to evaluate LLM agents for real-world deployment.

Result: 模型在合成数据和神经记录中准确恢复底层流形结构，且计算成本随数据长度线性增长。

Conclusion: 该模型在效率和可解释性上优于现有方法，适用于复杂时间序列建模。

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome

Result: 实验表明，DGP在可控的token预算内，将欺诈检测性能提升至多6.8%（AUPRC）。

Conclusion: DGP展示了图增强LLM在欺诈检测中的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

Conclusion: 多类情况下，推导了归一化和自一致性条件，证明这些是机器学习模型具有有效概率解释的必要条件，并通过不确定性传播框架展示了其在UQ中的应用。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

Conclusion: PREIG通过结合领域知识、优化理论和深度学习，为高维非线性时间序列预测提供了稳健、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

Result: 该方法能够加速材料发现，并深化对工艺-结构-性能关系的理解。

Conclusion: evoxels框架为材料科学提供了一种高效的工具，促进了跨学科合作和逆向材料设计。

Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced
microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and
computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and
properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design
where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal
microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging
with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery
and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The
differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified
voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical
simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.

TL;DR: TempRe是一种生成框架，将基于模板的方法重新定义为序列生成，实现了可扩展、灵活且化学合理的逆合成分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模板的方法在逆合成分析中可扩展性和泛化能力有限，而无模板生成方法可能生成无效反应。TempRe旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TempRe将基于模板的方法重新表述为序列生成，支持单步和多步逆合成任务。

Result: 在单步和多步逆合成任务中，TempRe优于模板分类和SMILES生成方法，并在PaRoutes多步基准测试中表现出色。

Conclusion: TempRe展示了模板生成模型在计算机辅助合成规划中的潜力。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

TL;DR: RF-CRATE是一种数学可解释的深度网络架构，用于射频（RF）传感，基于复杂稀疏率降低原理，性能与黑盒模型相当，同时提供完全可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度无线传感（DWS）模型多为黑盒，缺乏可解释性，限制了其通用性，尤其在安全敏感应用中存在问题。

Method: 通过非平凡理论推导，将实值白盒Transformer扩展至复数域，构建完全复数域的白盒Transformer，并引入子空间正则化增强特征多样性。

Result: RF-CRATE在多个传感任务中性能提升19.98%，分类精度提高5.08%，回归误差降低10.34%。

Conclusion: RF-CRATE在保持高性能的同时提供数学可解释性，为RF传感领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

TL;DR: 本文探讨了利用贝叶斯优化（BO）优化碳捕集与封存（CCS）项目决策变量的策略，比较了多种随机模型，并展示了其在提高经济可行性和可持续性方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS技术对可持续发展至关重要，但现有方法如高斯过程（GPs）在某些情况下表现不佳，需要探索更有效的优化方法。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化框架，比较了高斯过程和其他新型随机模型，以优化CCS项目的决策变量，并结合净现值（NPV）作为目标函数。

Result: 研究表明，在决策变量多或目标函数尺度不一致的情况下，新型随机模型优于高斯过程，提高了经济性和可持续性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化，尤其是结合新型随机模型，为CCS项目提供了一种更有效的优化方法，有望推动能源行业的可持续发展。

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

Motivation: FNOs作为高维偏微分方程的替代模型，其稳定性和频率行为缺乏理论解释，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用有效场论方法，推导层核和四点顶点的闭递归关系，分析解析激活、尺度不变性和残差连接三种重要场景。

Result: 理论表明非线性激活会耦合频率输入到高频模式，实验验证了频率转移；提出权重初始化的临界条件，实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: 非线性使FNOs能捕捉非平凡特征，尺度不变激活和残差连接增强特征学习，为超参数选择提供依据。

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

Result: 方法能高精度发现ODE，且无需正则化即可实现稀疏解，对噪声数据鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的物理现象学习提供了实用工具，适用于真实实验环境。

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

glucose, smoking, alcohol, activity) factors on CVD occurrence. We have
performed statistical analyses, including t-tests, Chi-square tests, and ANOVA,
to identify strong associations between CVD and elderly people, hypertension,
higher weight, and abnormal cholesterol levels, while physical activity (a
protective factor). A logistic regression model highlights age, blood pressure,

for smoking and alcohol, suggesting potential data issues. Model performance
comparisons reveal CatBoost as the top performer with an accuracy of 0.734 and
an ECE of 0.0064 and excels in probabilistic prediction (Brier score = 0.1824).

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one

enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple

on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated
using AlphaFold initial guess, DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13%
on structure-normalized RMSD across our challenging multi-state protein

Abstract: Cloud computing offers on-demand resource access, regulated by Service-Level

propose an SLA-aware automated algorithm-selection framework for combinatorial
optimization problems in resource-constrained cloud environments. The framework
uses an ensemble of machine learning models to predict performance and rank
algorithm-hardware pairs based on SLA constraints. We also apply our framework
to the 0-1 knapsack problem. We curate a dataset comprising instance specific
features along with memory usage, runtime, and optimality gap for 6 algorithms.
As an empirical benchmark, we evaluate the framework on both classification and
regression tasks. Our ablation study explores the impact of hyperparameters,
learning approaches, and large language models effectiveness in regression, and
SHAP-based interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化RL在LLMs后训练中的经济影响，填补这一领域的研究空白。

Method: 提出RLPF（基于性能反馈的强化学习）方法，利用历史广告数据作为奖励信号，训练AdLlama模型。

Result: 在Facebook的大规模A/B测试中，AdLlama将点击率提升6.7%，广告主满意度更高。

Conclusion: RLPF是一种有效的后训练方法，能显著提升生成式AI在实际应用中的表现。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models
(LLMs), is poised to drive transformative economic change. LLMs are pre-trained
on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏不仅是模型压缩技术，还能提升黑盒对抗攻击的效率和效果。

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

Conclusion: 本研究通过DRL方法弥合了数据驱动学习与分析性洞察之间的差距，为库存管理提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

Motivation: 解决连续时间深度学习模型（如神经ODE）在训练中学习表达性强且稳定的时间依赖权重的挑战。

Method: 通过多项式基函数（单项式和Legendre多项式）约束权重的时间演化，并在神经ODE和ResNet架构中评估其性能。

Result: Legendre多项式基在训练稳定性、计算成本和准确性方面优于单项式基和无约束权重模型。

Conclusion: 选择正交多项式基（如Legendre）在模型表达性和训练效率之间提供了良好的平衡。

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能提升复杂预测环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow
in complexity, manual authoring and maintenance of contracts becomes
error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

Abstract: The paper sketches some initial results from an ongoing project to develop an
ontology-based digital form for representing uncertain information. We frame
this work as a journey from lower to higher levels of digital maturity across a
technology divide. The paper first sets a baseline by describing the basic
challenges any project dealing with digital uncertainty faces. It then
describes how the project is facing them. It shows firstly how an extensional
ontology (such as the BORO Foundational Ontology or the Information Exchange
Standard) can be extended with a Lewisian counterpart approach to formalizing
uncertainty that is adapted to computing. And then it shows how this is
expressive enough to handle the challenges. Keywords: actuality, BORO
Foundational Ontology, counterpart, Information Exchange Standard,
informational uncertainty, my doxastic actualities, two-dimensional semantics.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的Skyline分析方法，包括RankSky和CoSky方法，并通过实验评估了它们的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Skyline操作在高基数结果集中缺乏有效的比较方法，dp-idf方法效率低且排名不明确。

Method: 提出了RankSky方法（基于PageRank）和CoSky方法（基于TOPSIS和Gini指数），并结合多级Skyline提出DeepSky。

Result: 通过实验评估了dp-idp、RankSky和CoSky的性能。

Conclusion: 改进的方法（RankSky和CoSky）在高基数Skyline分析中表现更优，且CoSky可直接嵌入DBMS。

Abstract: {Multi-criteria decision analysis in databases has been actively studied,
especially through the Skyline operator. Yet, few approaches offer a relevant
comparison of Pareto optimal, or Skyline, points for high cardinality result
sets. We propose to improve the dp-idp method, inspired by tf-idf, a recent
approach computing a score for each Skyline point, by introducing the concept
of dominance hierarchy. As dp-idp lacks efficiency and does not ensure a
distinctive rank, we introduce the RankSky method, the adaptation of Google's
well-known PageRank solution, using a square stochastic matrix, a teleportation
matrix, a damping factor, and then a row score eigenvector and the IPL
algorithm. For the same reasons as RankSky, and also to offer directly
embeddable in DBMS solution, we establish the TOPSIS based CoSky method,
derived from both information research and multi-criteria analysis. CoSky
automatically ponderates normalized attributes using the Gini index, then
computes a score using Salton's cosine toward an ideal point. By coupling
multilevel Skyline to dp-idp, RankSky or CoSky, we introduce DeepSky.
Implementations of dp-idp, RankSky and CoSky are evaluated experimentally.

*Patrick Iff,Paul Bruegger,Marcin Chrapek,Maciej Besta,Torsten Hoefler*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文综述了过滤近似最近邻搜索（FANNS）方法，并引入了一个基于arXiv论文摘要的新数据集，评估了多种FANNS方法的性能，发现没有一种方法在所有场景下都表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FANNS领域缺乏多样化和真实的数据集，特别是基于最新Transformer文本嵌入模型的数据集，这限制了方法的评估和改进。

Method: 通过引入一个包含270万篇arXiv论文摘要嵌入向量及11种属性的新数据集，对多种FANNS方法进行了基准测试。

Result: 不同方法在不同场景下表现各异，例如ACORN适用于多种过滤类型但性能一般，SeRF在有序属性范围过滤中表现优异但无法处理分类属性。

Conclusion: 没有一种FANNS方法在所有情况下都是最优的，未来研究需要针对不同场景开发更专业化的方法。

Abstract: Advances in embedding models for text, image, audio, and video drive progress
across multiple domains, including retrieval-augmented generation,
recommendation systems, vehicle/person reidentification, and face recognition.
Many applications in these domains require an efficient method to retrieve
items that are close to a given query in the embedding space while satisfying a
filter condition based on the item's attributes, a problem known as Filtered
Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS). In this work, we present a
comprehensive survey and taxonomy of FANNS methods and analyze how they are
benchmarked in the literature. By doing so, we identify a key challenge in the
current FANNS landscape: the lack of diverse and realistic datasets,
particularly ones derived from the latest transformer-based text embedding
models. To address this, we introduce a novel dataset consisting of embedding
vectors for the abstracts of over 2.7 million research articles from the arXiv
repository, accompanied by 11 real-world attributes such as authors and
categories. We benchmark a wide range of FANNS methods on our novel dataset and
find that each method has distinct strengths and limitations; no single
approach performs best across all scenarios. ACORN, for example, supports
various filter types and performs reliably across dataset scales but is often
outperformed by more specialized methods. SeRF shows excellent performance for
range filtering on ordered attributes but cannot handle categorical attributes.
Filtered-DiskANN and UNG excel on the medium-scale dataset but fail on the
large-scale dataset, highlighting the challenge posed by transformer-based
embeddings, which are often more than an order of magnitude larger than earlier
embeddings. We conclude that no universally best method exists.

Result: 评估显示BERTScore F1和G-Eval分别达到96.3%和87.1%，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为领域特定、协作和可扩展的对话AI提供了潜力。

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query
decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses.
Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

addresses this need by developing and evaluating an image classification system
specifically designed for historical document pages, leveraging advancements in
artificial intelligence and machine learning. The set of categories was chosen
to facilitate content-specific processing workflows, separating pages requiring
different analysis techniques (e.g., OCR for text, image analysis for graphics)

TL;DR: FedFlex是一个联邦推荐系统，通过结合矩阵分解算法和MMR重新排序，提升推荐多样性，同时保持用户满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统主要关注准确性，而忽略了公平性和多样性。FedFlex旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 结合SVD和BPR矩阵分解算法，并应用MMR重新排序以增强多样性。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，FedFlex能有效引入多样性内容（如新类型）且不影响用户满意度。

Conclusion: FedFlex在联邦推荐系统中成功平衡了多样性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative
model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has
shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and
personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated
recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with
limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce
FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series
recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization
algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive
experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a
live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List
A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.
Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in
watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse
content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily
compromising user satisfaction.

Result: LLMs能够提升个性化、语义对齐和可解释性，并在冷启动和长尾场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: LLMs是构建更自适应、语义丰富且以用户为中心的推荐系统的关键推动者。

Abstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures
comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each
trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features.
While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges
including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited
personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item
content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new
paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native
mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged
to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of
LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,
illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,
and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.
LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate
effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external
knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven
architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of
conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for
understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal
is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but
foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and
user-centric recommender systems

Motivation: 当前视觉艺术推荐系统仅依赖视觉刺激进行用户建模，无法全面捕捉情感反应，而音乐刺激能引发独特的情感反馈，因此探索跨域推荐方法以提升艺术治疗的个性化效果。

Method: 提出了一系列基于音乐驱动偏好获取的跨域推荐方法，并通过大规模用户研究验证其有效性。

Result: 实验证明，音乐驱动的偏好获取方法优于传统的仅依赖视觉的方法。

Conclusion: 跨域推荐方法在艺术治疗中具有潜力，音乐驱动的偏好获取能显著提升个性化推荐效果。

Abstract: Art Therapy (AT) is an established practice that facilitates emotional
processing and recovery through creative expression. Recently, Visual Art
Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) have emerged to support AT, demonstrating their
potential by personalizing therapeutic artwork recommendations. Nonetheless,
current VA RecSys rely on visual stimuli for user modeling, limiting their
ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional responses during preference
elicitation. Previous studies have shown that music stimuli elicit unique
affective reflections, presenting an opportunity for cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) to enhance personalization in AT. Since CDR has not yet
been explored in this context, we propose a family of CDR methods for AT based
on music-driven preference elicitation. A large-scale study with 200 users
demonstrates the efficacy of music-driven preference elicitation, outperforming
the classic visual-only elicitation approach. Our source code, data, and models
are available at https://github.com/ArtAICare/Affect-aware-CDR

Abstract: In an era of radical technology transformations, technology maps play a
crucial role in enhancing decision making. These maps heavily rely on automated
methods of technology extraction. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented
Technology Extraction (RATE), a Large Language Model (LLM) based pipeline for
automated technology extraction from scientific literature. RATE combines
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with multi-definition LLM-based
validation. This hybrid method results in high recall in candidate generation
alongside with high precision in candidate filtering. While the pipeline is
designed to be general and widely applicable, we demonstrate its use on 678
research articles focused on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Extended
Reality (XR) as a case study. Consequently, The validated technology terms by
RATE were mapped into a co-occurrence network, revealing thematic clusters and
structural features of the research landscape. For the purpose of evaluation, a
gold standard dataset of technologies in 70 selected random articles had been
curated by the experts. In addition, a technology extraction model based on
Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT) was used as a
comparative method. RATE achieved F1-score of 91.27%, Significantly
outperforming BERT with F1-score of 53.73%. Our findings highlight the promise

Result: 发现短视频推荐算法更倾向于推送吸引人但内容单一的内容，且在政治敏感话题中存在偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了负责任AI实践的重要性，为设计公平透明的推荐系统提供了见解。

Abstract: The growing popularity of short-form video content, such as YouTube Shorts,
has transformed user engagement on digital platforms, raising critical
questions about the role of recommendation algorithms in shaping user
experiences. These algorithms significantly influence content consumption, yet
concerns about biases, echo chambers, and content diversity persist. This study
develops an efficient data collection framework to analyze YouTube's
recommendation algorithms for both short-form and long-form videos, employing
parallel computing and advanced scraping techniques to overcome limitations of
YouTube's API. The analysis uncovers distinct behavioral patterns in
recommendation algorithms across the two formats, with short-form videos
showing a more immediate shift toward engaging yet less diverse content
compared to long-form videos. Furthermore, a novel investigation into biases in
politically sensitive topics, such as the South China Sea dispute, highlights
the role of these algorithms in shaping narratives and amplifying specific
viewpoints. By providing actionable insights for designing equitable and
transparent recommendation systems, this research underscores the importance of
responsible AI practices in the evolving digital media landscape.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过数据增强和图对比学习有效解决了推荐系统中的数据稀疏和流行度偏差问题。

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the
explicit genres supplied by the publishers.

Method: 使用句子嵌入和动态阈值聚类算法构建内容空间的结构化表示，并提出用户控制的探索机制。

Result: 实验显示推荐列表内相似性从0.34降至0.26，意外性提升至0.73，72.7%的长期用户偏好探索性推荐。

Conclusion: 系统在保持用户满意度的同时，显著提升了内容发现的多样性和意外性。

Abstract: Recommender systems often struggle with over-specialization, which severely
limits users' exposure to diverse content and creates filter bubbles that
reduce serendipitous discovery. To address this fundamental limitation, this
paper introduces an adaptive clustering framework with user-controlled
exploration that effectively balances personalization and diversity in movie
recommendations. Our approach leverages sentence-transformer embeddings to
group items into semantically coherent clusters through an online algorithm
with dynamic thresholding, thereby creating a structured representation of the
content space. Building upon this clustering foundation, we propose a novel
exploration mechanism that empowers users to control recommendation diversity
by strategically sampling from less-engaged clusters, thus expanding their
content horizons while preserving relevance. Experiments on the MovieLens
dataset demonstrate the system's effectiveness, showing that exploration
significantly reduces intra-list similarity from 0.34 to 0.26 while
simultaneously increasing unexpectedness to 0.73. Furthermore, our Large
Language Model-based A/B testing methodology, conducted with 300 simulated
users, reveals that 72.7% of long-term users prefer exploratory recommendations
over purely exploitative ones, providing strong evidence for the system's
ability to promote meaningful content discovery without sacrificing user
satisfaction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于文件结构的ANN索引实现eCP-FS，解决了多索引竞争内存资源的问题，尽管性能稍逊，但在内存受限环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代分析流程中，多ANN索引竞争有限内存资源，导致需要磁盘索引结构。传统索引实现复杂且不易分析，本文提出一种文件结构映射方法，简化索引的可读性和分析。

Method: 将索引数据结构映射为文件结构，利用文件库实现跨语言和人类可读性，开发了eCP-FS（文件版eCP）。

Result: eCP-FS性能略低于内存索引，但在内存受限环境下具有最小内存占用，适合多索引或资源受限场景。

Conclusion: eCP-FS为资源受限环境提供了一种可行的替代方案，尽管性能有所牺牲，但其易读性和低内存需求使其在多索引场景中具有优势。

Abstract: Modern analytical pipelines routinely deploy multiple deep learning and
retrieval models that rely on approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) indexes to
support efficient similarity-based search. While many state-of-the-art
ANN-indexes are memory-based (e.g., HNSW and IVF), using multiple ANN indexes
creates a competition for limited GPU/CPU memory resources, which in turn
necessitates disk-based index structures (e.g., DiskANN or eCP). In typical
index implementations, the main component is a complex data structure that is
serialized to disk and is read either fully at startup time, for memory-based
indexes, or incrementally at query time, for disk-based indexes. To visualize
the index structure, or analyze its quality, complex coding is needed that is
either embedded in the index implementation or replicates the code that reads
the data structure. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach that
maps the data structure to a file structure, using a file library, making the
index easily readable for any programming language and even human-readable. The
disadvantage is that the serialized index is verbose, leading to overhead of
searching through the index. The question addressed in this paper is how severe
this performance penalty is. To that end, this paper presents eCP-FS, a
file-based implementation of eCP, a well-known disk-based ANN index. A
comparison with state-of-the-art indexes shows that while eCP-FS is slower, the
implementation is nevertheless somewhat competitive even when memory is not
constrained. In a memory-constrained scenario, eCP-FS offers a minimal memory
footprint, making it ideal for resource-constrained or multi-index
environments.

### [181] [(2,2)-GB Codes: Classification and Comparison with weight-4 Surface Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21237)
*François Arnault,Philippe Gaborit,Nicolas Saussay*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文介绍了三种新型的(2,2)-广义自行车码（GB码）家族，它们在量子纠错中表现优异，甚至打破了传统认为偶距离GB码不可能最优的认知。这些码的性能与Kitaev环面码和最佳2D权重-4表面码相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广义自行车码（GB码）为量子纠错提供了一种替代表面码的有力选择，尤其是(2,2)-GB码，其构造简单且性能优越。本文旨在探索这些码的最优性及其与现有表面码的关系。

Method: 通过利用二进制循环矩阵构造(2,2)-GB码，并引入CSS保持等价关系，系统地比较了基于Cayley图的CSS码。构建了三个无限家族的最优码，并分类了长度小于200的所有极值非等价码。

Result: 构造了三个最优(2,2)-GB码家族，其参数分别为[[2n^2,2,n]]、[[4r^2,2,2r]]和[[(2t+1)^2+1,2,2t+1]]。其中第二个家族打破了偶距离GB码不可能最优的传统认知。

Conclusion: (2,2)-GB码在性能上与最佳2D表面码相当，部分家族甚至超越了传统认知。通过引入CSS保持等价关系，为量子纠错码的比较提供了新框架。

Abstract: Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes offer a compelling alternative to surface
codes for quantum error correction. This paper focuses on (2,2)-Generalized
Bicycle codes, constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two
non-zero elements per row. Leveraging a lower bound on their minimum distance,
we construct three novel infinite families of optimal (2,2)-GB codes with
parameters [[ 2n^2, 2, n ]], [[ 4r^2, 2, 2r ]], and [[(2t + 1)^2 + 1, 2, 2t + 1
]]. These families match the performance of Kitaev's toric code and the best 2D
weight-4 surface codes, reaching known theoretical limits. In particular, the
second family breaks a long-held belief by providing optimal even-distance GB
codes, previously deemed impossible.
  All are CSS codes derived from Cayley graphs. Recognizing that standard
equivalence relations do not preserve their CSS structure, we introduce a
CSS-preserving equivalence relation for rigorous comparison of Cayley
graph-based CSS codes. Under this framework, the first two families are
inequivalent to all previously known optimal weight-4 2D surface codes, while
the third family is equivalent to the best-known odd-distance 2D surface code.
  Finally, we classify all extremal, non-equivalent (2,2)-GB codes with length
below 200 and present a comparison table with existing notable 2D weight-4
surface codes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分布式算法，用于解决无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中免授权接入的挑战，包括活动检测和导频污染缓解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网的发展，免授权接入方案成为支持大规模设备连接的有前景的解决方案，但其与无蜂窝大规模MIMO的集成带来了活动检测和导频污染缓解的挑战。

Method: 方法包括基于分布式最大似然的活动检测，以及伪先验混合变分贝叶斯和期望传播算法（PP-VB-EP）用于联合数据检测和信道估计。

Result: 提出的PP-VB-EP算法相比传统VB-EP表现出更好的收敛性和对初始化的鲁棒性，尤其是在数据符号来自有限字母表时。

Conclusion: 通过分布式变量级期望传播算法计算伪先验，PP-VB-EP有效防止了消息传递算法的发散，为无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统的免授权接入提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Cell-Free (CF) Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MaMIMO) is considered
one of the leading candidates for enabling next-generation wireless
communication. With the growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT), the
Grant-Free (GF) access scheme has emerged as a promising solution to support
massive device connectivity. The integration of GF and CF-MaMIMO introduces
significant challenges, particularly in designing distributed algorithms for
activity detection and pilot contamination mitigation. In this paper, we
propose a distributed algorithm that addresses these challenges. Our method
first employs a component-wise iterative distributed Maximum Likelihood (ML)
approach for activity detection, which considers both the pilot and data
portions of the received signal. This is followed by a Pseudo-Prior Hybrid
Variational Bayes and Expectation Propagation (PP-VB-EP) algorithm for joint
data detection and channel estimation. Compared to conventional VB-EP, the
proposed PP-VB-EP demonstrates improved convergence behavior and reduced
sensitivity to initialization, especially when data symbols are drawn from a
finite alphabet. The pseudo prior used in PP-VB-EP acts as an approximated
posterior and serves as a regularization term that prevents the Message Passing
(MP) algorithm from diverging. To compute the pseudo prior in a distributed
fashion, we further develop a distributed version of the Variable-Level
Expectation Propagation (VL-EP) algorithm.

Motivation: 研究有限域上群码的存在性，特别是壳维数的限制，以扩展先前仅针对阿贝尔群的工作。

Method: 通过证明群码存在的一般准则，并将其应用于推导壳维数≤3的群码的显式存在条件。

Result: 提出了一般准则，并特别推广了1维壳群码的存在性准则，适用于非阿贝尔群。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了群码存在性的理论，为非阿贝尔群提供了新的准则。

Abstract: Let $\mathbb {F}_q$ be a finite field and $G$ a finte group with $(|G|,q)=1$.
By a group code in $\mathbb {F}_q[G]$ we mean a two-sided ideal in $\mathbb
{F}_q[G]$. We will prove a general criterion for the existence of group codes
with given hull dimension, and then apply it to deduce explicit criterions for
existence of group codes with hull dimension $\leq3$. In particular our
criterion for the existence of $1$-dimensional hulls generalizes that of
privious work which consider only abelian groups $G$.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于可重构智能表面（RIS）的无线通信，采用双时间尺度方法优化RIS相位，以减少信道估计开销。研究发现，RIS捕获的功率与其元素数量线性增长，但双时间尺度波束成形增益在RIS元素增加时迅速饱和，最终增益由功率角度谱（PAS）的衰减速率决定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过双时间尺度方法优化RIS相位，减少信道估计开销，提高通信效率。

Method: 采用双时间尺度方法优化RIS相位，分析RIS元素数量与波束成形增益的关系。

Result: RIS捕获的功率随元素数量线性增长，但波束成形增益在元素增加时迅速饱和，最终增益由PAS衰减速率决定。

Conclusion: RIS辅助通信的有效性受PAS衰减速率影响，需考虑其饱和特性以优化系统设计。

Abstract: This paper considers wireless communication assisted by a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS), focusing on the two-timescale approach, in which the
RIS phase shifts are optimized based on channel statistics to mitigate the
overheads associated with channel estimation. It is shown that, while the power
captured by the RIS scales linearly with the number of its elements, the
two-timescale beamforming gain upon re-radiation towards the receiver saturates
rapidly as the number of RIS elements increases, for a broad class of power
angular spectra (PAS). The ultimate achievable gain is determined by the decay
rate of the PAS in the angular domain, which directly influences how rapidly
spatial correlations between RIS elements diminish. The implications of this
saturation on the effectiveness of RIS-assisted communications are discussed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管PDPR优化在蜂窝网络中已有广泛研究，但其在RIS辅助网络中的作用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过基于信道统计调整RIS相位，优化PDPR，并在宏蜂窝部署场景中进行验证。

Result: 优化PDPR在多种操作条件下均表现出显著性能提升，尤其在RIS元素数量或信道相干性增加时更为明显。

Conclusion: RIS辅助网络中优化PDPR能显著提升性能，特别是在大规模RIS或高信道相干性条件下。

Abstract: The optimization of the \gls{pdpr} is a recourse that helps wireless systems
to acquire channel state information while minimizing the pilot overhead. While
the optimization of the \gls{pdpr} in cellular networks has been studied
extensively, the effect of the \gls{pdpr} in \gls{ris}-assisted networks has
hardly been examined. This paper tackles this optimization when the
communication is assisted by a RIS whose phase shifts are adjusted on the basis
of the statistics of the channels. For a setting representative of a
macrocellular deployment, the benefits of optimizing the PDPR are seen to be
significant over a broad range of operating conditions. These benefits,
demonstrated through the ergodic minimum mean squared error, for which a
closed-form solution is derived, become more pronounced as the number of RIS
elements and/or the channel coherence grow large.

Result: 证明$d_K$不是欧几里得距离，但可以在有限点集上实现尺度嵌入。

Conclusion: 为未来研究$d_K$的更多性质提供了框架和工具，并提出了若干开放问题。

Abstract: The domain-independent universal Normalized Information Distance based on
Kolmogorov complexity has been (in approximate form) successfully applied to a
variety of difficult clustering problems. In this paper we investigate
theoretical properties of the un-normalized algorithmic information distance
$d_K$. The main question we are asking in this work is what properties this
curious distance has, besides being a metric. We show that many
(in)finite-dimensional spaces can(not) be isometrically scale-embedded into the
space of finite strings with metric $d_K$. We also show that $d_K$ is not an
Euclidean distance, but any finite set of points in Euclidean space can be
scale-embedded into $(\{0,1\}^*,d_K)$. A major contribution is the development
of the necessary framework and tools for finding more (interesting) properties
of $d_K$ in future, and to state several open problems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种共生认识论框架和SynLang协议，旨在通过透明推理模式和信心评估实现人类与AI的协作决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统的不透明推理过程阻碍了人类监督和协作潜力，传统可解释AI方法无法实现真正的共生协作。

Method: 提出共生认识论作为哲学基础，并引入SynLang协议，包括TRACE和TRACE_FE机制，结合信心量化和上下文继承。

Result: 通过实际人类-AI对话验证了框架的有效性，展示了AI对结构化推理协议的适应和元认知干预的成功。

Conclusion: SynLang和共生认识论通过双层次透明性增强了人类智能，保留了人类能动性，并支持协作决策中的伦理问责。

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

Motivation: 通过LLM辅助开发Synthea疾病模块，旨在提高效率、降低门槛、丰富模型多样性，并改进合成患者数据的质量。

Method: 提出四种LLM支持方式：生成疾病概况、从概况生成模块、评估现有模块、优化模块，并引入渐进式优化概念。

Result: LLM在模块开发中表现出潜力，但也面临需人工监督、严格测试及LLM生成内容准确性等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究以充分发挥LLM在合成数据生成中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

Motivation: 研究LLMs的内部工作机制，超越仅衡量模型能力的指标，探索其信息处理方式。

Method: 引入任务无关的“认知剖面”方法，基于“熵衰减曲线”和“信息增益跨度（IGS）指数”量化模型的信息处理动态。

Result: 发现不同LLMs具有独特且一致的认知剖面，且这些剖面受模型规模和文本复杂度影响。

Conclusion: 提供了一种新的、原则性的方法来分析和比较人工智能的内在操作动态。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将对齐视为静态或事后属性的问题，提出动态对齐监测框架以提升实际可靠性。

Method: 引入可测量的对齐损失和元对齐概念，通过场景评分、阈值调整、策略验证和反馈吸收实现动态调整。

Conclusion: NPO为持续对齐监测提供了紧凑、可检查的架构，连接理论对齐保证与实际动态环境中的可靠性。

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高风险生活建议中缺乏标准保障，可能导致误导性回答，因此需要研究其失败模式和改进方法。

Method: 通过三个实验：(1) 多项选择评估模型稳定性；(2) 自由回答分析结合安全分类和LLM法官；(3) 机制解释实验操纵“高风险”激活向量。

Result: 部分模型表现出奉承行为，但如o4-mini等模型表现稳健；高安全性模型常通过提问澄清问题而非直接建议；激活操纵可控制模型的谨慎性。

Conclusion: 需要多方面的基准测试以确保LLMs在重大决策中的可信度，激活操纵为安全对齐提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

Motivation: 理解并可靠地遏制大型语言模型的有害行为。

Method: 学习55个有害子概念的线性探针，构建有害子空间，测试子空间消融和主导方向引导。

Conclusion: 概念子空间为理解和改进语言模型行为提供了可扩展的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应可解释AI框架（AXTF），通过实时监测用户的认知和情绪状态，动态调整解释内容，以在高压力、时间敏感的环境中促进人机协作的快速信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI（XAI）方法在高风险场景中提供统一解释且依赖显式反馈，难以满足紧急响应等高压环境的需求。

Method: 提出AXTF框架，利用EEG、ECG和眼动追踪等生理和行为信号推断用户状态，并通过多目标个性化信任估计模型动态调整解释内容。

Result: AXTF能够非侵入性地适应用户状态，提供个性化解释，从而增强人机协作中的快速信任。

Conclusion: AXTF为开发适应高压、时间敏感环境的自适应XAI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应集群协作方法，通过自多样性和跨一致性最大化机制提升LLMs在医疗决策支持中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作方法缺乏明确的组件选择规则，且依赖预定义集群，部分LLMs在医疗场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过计算LLM的自多样性值和跨一致性值，动态选择高性能LLM并剔除不一致输出。

Result: 在NEJMQA和MMLU-Pro-health数据集上表现优异，如NEJMQA的Obstetrics and Gynecology学科ACC达65.47%，优于GPT-4的56.12%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLMs在医疗决策支持中的协作效果，尤其在专业医学领域表现突出。

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源在主动配电网中的渗透率增加，缺乏专业知识的运营商依赖人工专家成本高且耗时，需要智能化的解决方案。

Method: 将ADN调度问题分解为多个阶段，设计多LLM协作架构（信息提取器、问题建模器和代码编程器），并针对每个LLM代理开发定制优化技术。

Result: 通过自然语言查询生成调度策略，消除技术障碍，提高效率。多种测试案例验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM驱动方法为ADN调度提供了高效、用户友好的解决方案，显著降低了技术门槛。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of
the proposed architecture and methods.

Conclusion: 风险作为BFO:Role的子类更为合适，未来可进一步研究其必要条件。

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

Result: 在多个数据集、LLM和偏见类型上验证，框架优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能更有效地揭示医学LLM的复杂偏见模式，具有更强的可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously
updated collection of relevant studies for agentic web is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在组合式语言解释中的能力，发现其表现随问题复杂性增加而显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能系统化、组合式地解释问题并将其映射为SPARQL查询。

Method: 基于DBpedia的图模式生成三个难度不同的数据集，使用Lemon lexica进行语言化，并通过不同提示、少样本优化和微调技术进行实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着问题复杂性增加，LLMs的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，表明其组合解释能力有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在系统化和组合式解释问题方面存在困难。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

Motivation: 传统方法将推理和训练分离导致资源浪费和延迟适应新数据，LeMix旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源。

Result: LeMix提升吞吐量3.53倍，减少推理损失0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现LLM推理与训练的联合优化，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Method: 系统包括一个查询分类器（检测模糊编程查询）和一个微调LLM（生成澄清问题）。

Result: 微调LLM在生成有用澄清问题上优于零样本提示，用户研究表明其生成的代码响应更准确和有用。

Conclusion: 该编码助手通过提问澄清问题，显著提高了代码生成的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Conclusion: 尽管在区分可信信息和平衡系统延迟方面仍有挑战，但该框架为提升RALM可靠性迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

### [211] [Shapley Uncertainty in Natural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21406)
*Meilin Zhu,Gaojie Jin,Xiaowei Huang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量方法，优于传统的阈值方法，能更准确地预测LLM在问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在问答任务中，确定何时信任大语言模型（LLM）的输出至关重要。现有的语义熵方法依赖于阈值设定，缺乏对语义关系连续性的捕捉。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley的语义不确定性度量框架，满足三个基本性质，并通过实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，Shapley不确定性比基线方法更准确地预测LLM在问答任务中的表现。

Conclusion: Shapley不确定性提供了一种更精细的方法来衡量LLM输出的可信度，适用于问答及其他任务。

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and

TL;DR: Evo-DKD是一个双解码器框架，结合结构化本体遍历和非结构化文本推理，用于自主本体演化，优于纯结构化或非结构化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动维护本体和知识图谱耗时费力，而大型语言模型（LLMs）虽拥有丰富非结构化知识，但难以保持结构化一致性。

Method: Evo-DKD采用双解码器框架，一个生成本体编辑候选，另一个生成自然语言解释，通过动态注意力门控机制协调两者。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-DKD在本体更新精度和下游任务性能上优于纯结构化或非结构化方法。

Conclusion: Evo-DKD结合符号和神经推理，为LLM驱动的知识库维护提供了新范式。

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Motivation: 评估Sherpa Rx在药理学中的性能，验证其整合CPIC和PharmGKB数据后的效果。

Method: 分两阶段评估Sherpa Rx：第一阶段仅嵌入CPIC数据，第二阶段加入PharmGKB内容，通过准确性、相关性等指标评分。

Result: Sherpa Rx在准确性（4.9）、相关性（5.0）等指标上表现优异，显著优于ChatGPT-4omini。

Conclusion: 整合CPIC和PharmGKB的RAG技术显著提升AI性能，Sherpa Rx在药理学中具有变革潜力。

Abstract: This study evaluated Sherpa Rx, an artificial intelligence tool leveraging
large language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
pharmacogenomics, to validate its performance on key response metrics. Sherpa
Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的框架，在低数据条件下实现红外光谱的自动分析，通过多轮推理动态优化预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外光谱分析面临高维度和重叠谱带的挑战，传统方法难以应对。LLM因其泛化和推理能力，有望自动化复杂科学流程，但尚未广泛应用于红外光谱分析。

Method: 提出端到端的LLM驱动框架，整合文献知识库、光谱预处理、特征提取和多任务推理，通过多轮闭环协议动态优化预测。

Result: 在多种材料数据集上，多轮LLM推理效果优于单轮推理，并在低数据条件下媲美或超越传统机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的框架为低数据条件下的红外光谱分析提供了高效、自动化的解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

Result: 仅需20局棋局即可精准预测个人行为和模式，数据效率显著提升。

Conclusion: Maia4All为个性化AI行为建模树立新标准，并展示其在更广泛领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）简化供应链管理中的决策过程，减少对数据科学团队的依赖，并加速决策时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链管理中的决策工具虽然优化了决策，但理解和调整这些工具的建议仍需大量时间和专家介入，限制了效率。

Method: 应用大型语言模型（LLMs）来自动化解释工具结果、分析场景和更新数学模型，减少人工干预。

Result: 通过LLMs，决策时间从数天或数周缩短至几分钟或几小时，显著提高了规划者和高管的效率。

Conclusion: LLMs可以民主化供应链技术，使其更易理解和交互，从而大幅提升决策速度和生产力。

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，评估了28种MLLMs的诚实行为，并尝试了监督和偏好学习对齐方法。

Result: 多数模型无法适当拒绝回答不可回答问题，且诚实行为受视觉信息影响，需专门的多模态对齐方法。

Conclusion: 论文为未来可信MLLMs研究提供了基准和方法基础，强调诚实行为需结合视觉信息优化。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该定义为研究神经网络中的世界模型提供了基础，未来可扩展至动作效应的建模。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Conclusion: ST-GDance通过解耦时空依赖，显著降低了计算成本并避免了碰撞，适用于大规模群体舞蹈生成。

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

Conclusion: 个性化解释方法有助于提升非专家用户对AI的理解和信任。

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注单智能体与单人类的交互，忽略了团队协作中可读决策的潜力。

Method: 扩展可读决策到多智能体设置，并在多智能体基准场景中验证。

Result: 实验表明，包含可读智能体的团队表现优于仅含标准最优行为智能体的团队。

Conclusion: 团队协作中引入可读决策能显著提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统人员配置方法中无法灵活表达优化目标和缺乏持续员工画像更新的问题。

Method: 提出StaffPro代理，结合数学框架和LLM，通过自然语言交互和反馈循环实现联合优化。

Result: 在咨询公司模拟中，StaffPro成功估计员工属性并生成高质量排班表。

Conclusion: StaffPro为自动化人员管理提供了灵活、可解释且以人为中心的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs相比纯语言模型更容易受到有害输入的影响，作者希望通过分析其内部动态来提升安全性。

Method: 定义了三种关键能力（安全感知、语义理解和语言表达对齐），并提出SASA技术，通过将中间层的语义信息投影到早期安全层来增强安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SASA显著提升了LVLMs的安全性，同时对实用性影响极小。

Conclusion: 通过自感知安全增强技术，可以有效提升LVLMs的安全性，且无需微调。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in
assistive robotics tasks. Assistax uses JAX's hardware acceleration for
significant speed-ups for learning in physics-based simulations. In terms of
open-loop wall-clock time, Assistax runs up to $370\times$ faster when
vectorising training runs compared to CPU-based alternatives. Assistax
conceptualises the interaction between an assistive robot and an active human
patient using multi-agent RL to train a population of diverse partner agents
against which an embodied robotic agent's zero-shot coordination capabilities
can be tested. Extensive evaluation and hyperparameter tuning for popular
continuous control RL and MARL algorithms provide reliable baselines and
establish Assistax as a practical benchmark for advancing RL research for
assistive robotics. The code is available at:

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BellNet的新方法，通过将策略迭代展开和截断为可学习的参数模型，以减少计算成本并高效逼近最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态规划（DP）在解决马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）时，传统方法如策略迭代在状态-动作空间大或涉及长期依赖时计算成本高。

Method: 将策略迭代展开为可学习的参数模型BellNet，通过最小化Bellman误差训练，并利用图信号处理重新参数化为非线性图滤波器级联。

Result: 初步实验表明，BellNet在网格环境中能以较少的迭代次数有效逼近最优策略。

Conclusion: BellNet提供了一种简洁、可迁移且统一的策略和价值迭代表示，显著降低了推理复杂度。

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

Result: 实验表明，GDAIP生成的个体分区具有拓扑合理的边界、跨会话一致性和反映功能组织的能力。

Conclusion: GDAIP能有效解决跨数据集脑功能分区中的域适应问题，生成高质量的个体分区。

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

Result: 证明所有研究片段的有界拟合问题均为NP完全，且其他ALC学习算法无法提供类似概率保证。

Conclusion: 有界拟合在ALC及其片段中具有理论优势，并通过SAT求解器实现高效优化。

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

study evaluates a RAG system used in due diligence for an investment fund. We
propose a robust evaluation protocol combining human annotations and LLM-Judge
annotations to identify system failures, like hallucinations, off-topic, failed

method, we achieve precise performance measurements with statistical
guarantees. We provide a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our
contributions aim to enhance the reliability and scalability of RAG systems

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效推断异质性因果关系，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

Motivation: 现有方法如FlowGRPO在图像生成的人偏好对齐中效率不足，需对所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化。

Method: MixGRPO引入滑动窗口机制，窗口内用SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Result: MixGRPO在多个维度上优于DanceGRPO，训练时间减少50%，MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样策略显著提升了效率和性能，为图像生成的人偏好对齐提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLMs作为端到端预测器会导致数值精度损失，或在潜在空间中难以对齐文本和时间序列模态。

Method: 提出DualSG双流框架，利用LLMs作为语义指导模块，引入时间序列描述（Time Series Caption）显式总结趋势模式，并设计描述引导的融合模块。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，DualSG优于15种先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式结合数值预测与语义指导能显著提升多元时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Result: 实验表明，联合信念更新显著优于被动目标识别，且领域无关的MCTS表现与领域特定的贪婪基线相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为多智能体系统提供了一种实用且鲁棒的目标推断方法，推动了交互性和适应性的发展。

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

Motivation: GRPO算法因稀疏奖励规则导致组内奖励相同，引发优势崩溃问题，现有方法主要通过模型反思和内部反馈解决，但仍有局限性。

Method: 分析模型反思的局限性，研究细粒度样本级别的策略熵，提出EDGE-GRPO算法，结合熵驱动优势和引导错误校正。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MultiEditor是一个双分支潜在扩散框架，用于联合编辑驾驶场景中的图像和LiDAR点云，以解决真实世界数据长尾分布的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界数据的长尾分布限制了自动驾驶系统的泛化能力，尤其是对罕见但安全关键的车辆类别。

Method: 引入3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）作为目标对象的结构和外观先验，设计多级外观控制机制和深度引导的可变形跨模态条件模块。

Result: MultiEditor在视觉和几何保真度、编辑可控性和跨模态一致性方面表现优异，显著提升了感知模型对罕见类别车辆的检测精度。

Conclusion: MultiEditor通过生成罕见类别车辆数据，有效提升了自动驾驶系统的感知能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs在图结构数据的预测任务中表现优异，但缺乏符号化领域知识和通用推理能力；而RBNs支持生成式概率建模和符号推理。结合两者可以弥补各自的不足。

Method: 开发了两种集成方法：一种将GNNs直接编译为RBN语言，另一种将GNNs作为外部组件保留。同时提出了一种最大后验（MAP）推理方法。

Result: 在节点分类和环境规划两个问题上验证了框架的有效性，显著提高了分类准确性并支持复杂决策。

Conclusion: 该研究为图数据提供了一种强大的神经符号方法，结合了学习和推理能力，适用于多样化任务。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Motivation: GitHub仓库的README文件内容不完整可能影响其潜力的发挥，研究旨在通过自动分类工具提升README文件的质量和利用率。

Method: 研究微调了三种编码器模型（BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa），并使用包含4226个README文件片段的黄金标准数据集进行训练。同时探索了PEFT技术（如LoRA）的经济性替代方案。

Result: 方法在F1分数上达到0.98，优于现有技术，且PEFT技术在性能损失较小的情况下提供了经济性选择。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs可用于自动分类GitHub README文件内容，为提升仓库识别和潜在用途提供了自动化工具支持。

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

curriculum training pipeline, Libra-Guard enhances data efficiency by employing
guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on
manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce
Libra-Test, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain
experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy,
outperforming Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (74.33%) and ShieldLM-Qwen-14B-Chat

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的零样本HAR方法存在隐私、依赖性和版本不一致等问题，需要替代方案。

Method: 利用自然语言嵌入建模传感器数据和活动，进行零样本分类，避免使用LLM。

Result: 在六个数据集上的详细案例研究表明，语言建模能有效支持零样本HAR系统。

Conclusion: 该方法为不依赖LLM的零样本HAR提供了可行方案，展示了语言建模的潜力。

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

Conclusion: 领域适应和推理增强的LLMs在移动网络RCA中具有实际应用潜力，能提升解释性和效果。

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释AI方法在适应不同健康领域利益相关者（如临床医生、政策制定者和公众）的需求方面存在不足，缺乏结构化和适应性。

Method: PHAX采用多层架构，结合可废止推理、自适应自然语言技术和用户建模，生成上下文感知和用户特定的解释。

Conclusion: PHAX通过将形式推理方法与沟通需求结合，推动了透明、以人为中心的AI在公共卫生领域的应用。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂任务中表现出色，但在模糊或间接表达目标时与用户的主动协作能力未被充分探索。

Method: 引入UserBench，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具做出决策。

Result: 评估显示，代理任务完成与用户意图对齐率仅20%，高级模型通过主动交互发现的用户偏好不足30%。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了重要工具，强调需发展真正的协作伙伴而不仅是任务执行者。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Abstract: While the last decade has witnessed significant advancements in Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, performance of these systems for individuals
with speech disabilities remains inadequate, partly due to limited public
training data. To bridge this gap, the 2025 Interspeech Speech Accessibility
Project (SAP) Challenge was launched, utilizing over 400 hours of SAP data
collected and transcribed from more than 500 individuals with diverse speech
disabilities. Hosted on EvalAI and leveraging the remote evaluation pipeline,
the SAP Challenge evaluates submissions based on Word Error Rate and Semantic
Score. Consequently, 12 out of 22 valid teams outperformed the whisper-large-v2
baseline in terms of WER, while 17 teams surpassed the baseline on SemScore.
Notably, the top team achieved the lowest WER of 8.11\%, and the highest
SemScore of 88.44\% at the same time, setting new benchmarks for future ASR
systems in recognizing impaired speech.
