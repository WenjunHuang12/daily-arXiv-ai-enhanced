Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于压缩和适应两大核心特性的原生AI驱动空口架构，用于6G网络，通过语义通信提升系统效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能有望成为6G网络全生命周期的基础能力，需要设计能够理解语义信息而非符号级精度的新型空口架构。

Conclusion: 原生AI在6G网络中具有广阔应用前景，但仍面临诸多挑战，需要进一步研究语义通信等关键技术。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

*Eito Kurihara,Hideki Ochiai*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出基于非等概率非均匀星座和削峰滤波技术的高容量低PAPR OFDM系统，通过截断高斯分布生成星座，在AWGN和频率选择性瑞利衰落信道中同时实现低PAPR和高频谱效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OFDM系统高峰均比(PAPR)问题，同时保持高容量性能，通过星座设计和削峰滤波技术的结合来优化系统性能

Method: 使用截断高斯分布生成非等概率非均匀星座(NENU)，结合削峰滤波(CAF)和削峰噪声消除(CNC)技术，基于一维PAM设计降低解映射复杂度

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提系统在AWGN和频率选择性瑞利衰落信道中同时实现低PAPR和高频谱效率，在衰落信道中显著优于单载波对应系统

Conclusion: 星座整形与CAF和CNC技术的结合使BICM-OFDM系统能够同时实现低PAPR和高频谱效率，为高容量低PAPR通信系统提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio
(PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and
non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The
proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution,
and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform
constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points
without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since
the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters,
each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the
numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the
constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation
(PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM
receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of
OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate
performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the
receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the
presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of
constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to
simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading
channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system
significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded
BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading
channels.

### [5] [Time-Optimal Directed q-Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15583)
*Felix Windisch,Florian Unger*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于有向q分析的高效输出敏感算法，通过计算顺序反转和预计算缓存策略，实现了与输出大小线性相关的时间复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的有向q分析方法时间复杂度为输入大小的平方，限制了该技术的实际应用。实际网络中输出大小通常远小于最坏情况，需要开发输出敏感的优化算法

Method: 通过深入研究各种有向q分析方法之间的关系，发现反转计算顺序可以显著降低复杂度。采用目标预计算和缓存策略进一步减少开销，在温和假设下实现与输出大小线性相关的时间复杂度

Result: 开发出了时间最优的有向q分析算法，时间复杂度线性依赖于输出大小，相比之前平方级复杂度有显著提升

Conclusion: 该算法通过计算顺序优化和缓存策略，成功解决了有向q分析的计算效率问题，为网络结构分析提供了实用的高效工具

Abstract: Directed q-analysis is a recent extension of q-analysis, an established
method for extracting structure from networks, to directed graphs. Until
recently, a lack of efficient algorithms heavily restricted the application of
this technique: Previous approaches scale with the square of the input size,
which is also the maximal size of the output, rendering such approaches
worst-case optimal. In practice, output sizes of relevant networks are usually
far from the worst case, a fact that could be exploited by an (efficient)
output-sensitive algorithm. We develop such an algorithm and formally describe
it in detail. The key insight, obtained by carefully studying various
approaches to directed q-analysis and how they relate to each other, is that
inverting the order of computation leads to significant complexity gains.
Targeted precomputation and caching tactics further reduce the introduced
overhead, enough to achieve (under mild assumptions) a time complexity that is
linear in output size. The resulting algorithm for performing directed
q-analysis is shown to be time-optimal.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文首次解决了空间范围连接随机采样问题，提出了一种高效算法，在O(n+m+t)期望时间和O(n+m)空间复杂度内完成采样，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间范围连接在GIS、LBS等应用中很重要，但计算成本高且结果集过大。返回随机样本是实用解决方案，但如何在不执行完整连接的情况下高效获取随机样本是一个挑战性问题。

Method: 首先设计两种基于现有随机采样技术的基线算法，然后提出新的数据结构，能够在期望时间内高效处理空间范围连接的随机采样问题。

Result: 在四个真实空间数据集上的大量实验表明，该算法在大多数测试中显著快于基线方法，验证了其时间和空间效率。

Conclusion: 该研究首次解决了空间范围连接随机采样问题，提出的算法具有理论保证和实践价值，为相关应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial range joins have many applications, including geographic information
systems, location-based social networking services, neuroscience, and
visualization. However, joins incur not only expensive computational costs but
also too large result sets. A practical and reasonable approach to alleviating
these issues is to return random samples of the join results. Although this is
promising and sufficient for many applications involving spatial range joins,
efficiently computing random samples is not trivial. This is because we must
obtain random join samples without running spatial range joins. We address this
challenging problem for the first time and aim at designing a time- and
space-efficient algorithm. First, we design two baseline algorithms that employ
existing techniques for random sampling and show that they are not efficient.
Then, we propose a new data structure that can deal with our problem in
$\tilde{O}(n + m + t)$ expected time and $O(n+m)$ space, where $n$ and $m$ are
the sizes of two point sets and $t$ is the required number of samples. We
conduct extensive experiments using four real spatial datasets, and the results
demonstrate that our algorithm is significantly faster than the baselines in
most tests.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了CoreT算法，通过动态记录顶点和边进入k核的最早时间戳来大幅减少冗余计算，相比现有最优算法OTCD实现了4个数量级的加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间k核查询算法OTCD在可扩展性方面存在限制，由于区间枚举的组合增长和重复处理，无法有效处理大规模时间图分析

Method: CoreT算法动态记录每个顶点或边进入k核的最早时间戳，实现单次遍历查询区间，计算复杂度与时间边数量和区间长度呈线性关系

Result: 在大型真实数据集上的实验表明，CoreT相比OTCD实现了高达4个数量级的加速，证明了其在时间k核分析中的有效性和可扩展性

Conclusion: CoreT算法通过创新的时间戳记录策略显著提升了时间k核查询的效率，为长期时间分析提供了高度可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Querying cohesive subgraphs in temporal graphs is essential for understanding
the dynamic structure of real-world networks, such as evolving communities in
social platforms, shifting hyperlink structures on the Web, and transient
communication patterns in call networks. Recently, research has focused on the
temporal $k$-core query, which aims to identify all $k$-cores across all
possible time sub-intervals within a given query interval. The state-of-the-art
algorithm OTCD mitigates redundant computations over overlapping sub-intervals
by exploiting inclusion relationships among $k$-cores in different time
intervals. Nevertheless, OTCD remains limited in scalability due to the
combinatorial growth in interval enumeration and repeated processing. In this
paper, we revisit the temporal $k$-core query problem and introduce a novel
algorithm CoreT, which dynamically records the earliest timestamp at which each
vertex or edge enters a $k$-core. This strategy enables substantial pruning of
redundant computations. As a result, CoreT requires only a single pass over the
query interval and achieves improved time complexity, which is linear in both
the number of temporal edges within the query interval and the duration of the
interval, making it highly scalable for long-term temporal analysis.
Experimental results on large real-world datasets show that CoreT achieves up
to four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the existing state-of-the-art
OTCD, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for temporal $k$-core
analysis.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AmbiSQL是一个交互式系统，通过自动检测查询歧义并引导用户通过多项选择题澄清意图，显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Text-to-SQL任务中存在错误倾向，查询歧义是主要障碍，导致用户意图误解和SQL生成不准确。

Method: 引入细粒度歧义分类法识别影响数据库元素映射和LLM推理的歧义，结合用户反馈重写模糊问题，通过交互式多选择题澄清意图。

Result: 在歧义查询数据集上，AmbiSQL达到87.2%的歧义检测精度，与Text-to-SQL系统集成后SQL精确匹配准确率提升50%。

Conclusion: AmbiSQL展示了显著的性能提升和实际可用性，为处理Text-to-SQL中的查询歧义问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

TL;DR: 云边端协作查询处理方法，通过协作扫描运算符实现云边端资源动态切换，解决边缘资源瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在云边端协作查询处理中，当边缘资源达到瓶颈时，查询性能会下降，需要一种能够灵活切换查询执行地点的方法

Method: 构建云边端协作框架，基于协作扫描运算符，实现查询执行在云端和边缘之间的动态转移

Result: 在网络下载带宽充足的条件下，协作扫描运算符能有效缓解高I/O负载和CPU等待时间导致的性能下降，实现云边资源的均衡调度

Conclusion: 该方法通过协作扫描运算符实现了云边端查询执行的无缝切换，有效提升了查询性能和资源利用效率

Abstract: In cloud-edge-device (CED) collaborative query (CQ) processing, by leveraging
CED collaboration, the advantages of both cloud computing and edge resources
can be fully integrated. However, it is difficult to implement collaborative
operators that can flexibly switch between the cloud and the edge during query
execution. Thus, in this paper, we aim to improve the query performance when
the edge resources reach a bottleneck. To achieve seamless switching of query
execution between the cloud and edge, we propose a CQ processing method by
establishing a CED collaborative framework based on the collaborative scan
operator, so that query execution can be transferred to the cloud at any time
when the edge resources are saturated. Extensive experiments show that, under
sufficient network download bandwidth, the CED collaborative scan operator can
effectively alleviate the performance degradation of scan operators caused by
high I/O load and CPU wait time at the edge. It also achieves balanced resource
scheduling between the cloud and edge.

*Peiqi Yin,Xiao Yan,Qihui Zhou,Hui Li,Xiaolu Li,Lin Zhang,Meiling Wang,Xin Yao,James Cheng*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Gorgeous系统通过优先处理图结构而非向量数据，优化内存缓存和磁盘块格式，显著提升基于SSD的向量搜索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SSD的向量搜索系统存在数据布局不佳的问题，无法有效利用内存空间减少磁盘访问，且磁盘数据访问局部性差。研究发现图结构索引比向量本身访问更频繁，但现有系统未区分两者

Method: 设计Gorgeous系统，采用图结构优先原则：1）内存缓存保留图节点邻接表以提高缓存命中率；2）磁盘块格式显式存储邻居邻接表与向量以增强数据局部性

Result: 实验结果显示Gorgeous持续优于两种最先进的基于磁盘的向量搜索系统，平均查询吞吐量提升超过60%，查询延迟降低超过35%

Conclusion: 通过优先处理图结构索引而非向量数据，Gorgeous系统有效解决了现有基于SSD向量搜索系统的性能瓶颈，显著提升了搜索效率和响应速度

Abstract: Similarity-based vector search underpins many important applications, but a
key challenge is processing massive vector datasets (e.g., in TBs). To reduce
costs, some systems utilize SSDs as the primary data storage. They employ a
proximity graph, which connects similar vectors to form a graph and is the
state-of-the-art index for vector search. However, these systems are hindered
by sub-optimal data layouts that fail to effectively utilize valuable memory
space to reduce disk access and suffer from poor locality for accessing
disk-resident data. Through extensive profiling and analysis, we found that the
structure of the proximity graph index is accessed more frequently than the
vectors themselves, yet existing systems do not distinguish between the two. To
address this problem, we design the Gorgeous system with the principle of
prioritizing graph structure over vectors. Specifically, Gorgeous features a
memory cache that keeps the adjacency lists of graph nodes to improve cache
hits and a disk block format that explicitly stores neighbors' adjacency lists
along with a vector to enhance data locality. Experimental results show that
Gorgeous consistently outperforms two state-of-the-art disk-based systems for
vector search, boosting average query throughput by over 60% and reducing query
latency by over 35%.

*Yijie Zhou,Shengyuan Lin,Shufeng Gong,Song Yu,Shuhao Fan,Yanfeng Zhang,Ge Yu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: GoVector是一种针对基于磁盘的图索引的I/O高效缓存策略，通过静态缓存和动态缓存结合，以及磁盘节点重排序，显著减少I/O操作并提升查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的静态缓存策略在基于图的近似最近邻搜索中只能缓解初始导航阶段的I/O瓶颈，但在需要动态访问查询相关节点的第二阶段效果有限，导致I/O成为主要性能瓶颈。

Method: 结合静态缓存（存储入口点和频繁访问的邻居）和动态缓存（在第二阶段自适应捕获具有高空间局部性的节点），并通过磁盘节点重排序使相似向量位于相同或相邻页面。

Result: 在90%召回率下，平均减少46%的I/O操作，查询吞吐量提升1.73倍，查询延迟降低42%。

Conclusion: GoVector通过创新的缓存策略和存储布局优化，有效解决了基于磁盘的图索引系统的I/O瓶颈问题，显著提升了大规模近似最近邻搜索的性能。

Abstract: Graph-based high-dimensional vector indices have become a mainstream solution
for large-scale approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). However, their
substantial memory footprint often requires storage on secondary devices, where
frequent on-demand loading of graph and vector data leads to I/O becoming the
dominant bottleneck, accounting for over 90\% of query latency. Existing static
caching strategies mitigate this issue only in the initial navigation phase by
preloading entry points and multi-hop neighbors, but they fail in the second
phase where query-dependent nodes must be dynamically accessed to achieve high
recall. We propose GoVector, an I/O-efficient caching strategy tailored for
disk-based graph indices. GoVector combines (1) a static cache that stores
entry points and frequently accessed neighbors, and (2) a dynamic cache that
adaptively captures nodes with high spatial locality during the second search
phase. To further align storage layout with similarity-driven search patterns,
GoVector reorders nodes on disk so that similar vectors are colocated on the
same or adjacent pages, thereby improving locality and reducing I/O overhead.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that GoVector achieves
substantial performance improvements. At 90% recall, it reduces I/O operations
by 46% on average, increases query throughput by 1.73x, and lowers query
latency by 42% compared to state-of-the-art disk-based graph indexing systems.

### [12] [Robust Symbolic Reasoning for Visual Narratives via Hierarchical and Semantically Normalized Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14941)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义归一化框架，用于处理视觉叙事图谱中的不一致性和冗余问题，通过词汇相似性和嵌入聚类来统一语义相关的动作和事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事（如漫画）需要结构化表示来捕捉事件、角色及其关系，但符号化叙事图谱存在不一致性和冗余问题，限制了推理和泛化效果。

Method: 基于认知叙事理解模型，使用词汇相似性和嵌入聚类方法来整合语义相关的动作和事件，减少标注噪声并保持可解释性。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上的实验表明，语义归一化在动作检索、角色定位和事件摘要等叙事推理任务中提高了连贯性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 语义归一化是构建可扩展、认知启发的多模态叙事理解图谱模型的关键步骤。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博物馆展品是静态的，缺乏互动性和个性化体验。作者希望创造动态的、能与每位访客进行个性化对话的活艺术品，提升文化遗产互动体验。

Method: 采用边缘计算节点处理实时用户数据（姿态、表情、语音），生成式AI驱动数字艺术品响应，云端协作平台使用通用场景描述和光线追踪渲染，集成联邦学习保护隐私并持续优化个性化。

Result: 系统能够实现多用户同时体验，例如蒙娜丽莎可以同时对一位访客微笑而与另一位进行语音问答，提供高保真个性化视图并最小化延迟。

Conclusion: Holo-Artisan将静态博物馆展品转变为动态活艺术品，开创了文化遗产互动的新范式，通过边缘计算和联邦学习实现了低延迟、高隐私保护的个性化沉浸体验。

Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive
multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and
personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes
process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice --
for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital
artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For
instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a
spoken Q\&A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration
platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene
description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized
views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve
user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated
learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model
updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and
bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual
customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed
into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue,
heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes

TL;DR: 一种用于户外旅游景点的实时动态3D截获系统，结合多参数LiDAR和相机，实现30fps的广域场景可视化且延迟低于100ms


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在户外旅游景点应用遇到困难，传感器布置受限制且白天光照变化增加处理复杂性

Method: 结合多参数LiDAR和相机进行实时动态点云截获，与预截获静态点云集成，自动调整静态点云颜色以适应当前光照条件

Result: 系统在广域场景中维持30fps的性能，延迟保持在100ms以下，并通过实际部署证明了有效性

Conclusion: 该系统成功解决了户外旅游景点的实时动态3D截获挑战，为广域场景可视化提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Various real-time methods for capturing and transmitting dynamic 3D spaces
have been proposed, including those based on RGB-D cameras and volumetric
capture. However, applying existing methods to outdoor tourist sites remains
difficult because maintenance and aesthetic constraints limit sensor placement,
and daylight variability complicates processing. We propose a system that
combines multiple LiDARs and cameras for live dynamic point cloud capture, and
integrates them with pre-captured static point clouds for wide-area 3D
visualization. The system sustains 30 fps across wide-area scenes while keeping
latency below 100 ms. To mitigate lighting inconsistencies, static point-cloud
colors are automatically adjusted to current lighting. The effectiveness of our
system is demonstrated through real-world deployment in a tourist site.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文主张AI评估需要考虑系统可能具有战略推理能力，并建议使用博弈论方法来设计更有效的安全评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估方法可能无法充分检测到具有战略推理能力的AI系统在部署时的真实行为，需要更严谨的评估框架来确保AI安全性。

Method: 通过分析现有AI系统案例、相关研究综述以及对简化评估场景的形式化战略分析，来支持论文主张。

Result: 提出了AI系统可能理解环境并进行战略推理的证据，展示了博弈论分析如何帮助设计更可靠的评估方法。

Conclusion: AI测试评估必须考虑战略行为可能性，博弈论为构建更严谨的安全论证提供了有价值的分析工具，需要进一步研究相关方向。

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

### [17] [Almost and Approximate EFX for Few Types of Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15380)
*Vishwa Prakash HV,Ruta Mehta,Prajakta Nimbhorkar*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有k种不同加性估值的n个智能体之间的不可分割物品公平分配问题，证明了在最多4种不同估值时存在2/3-EFX分配，以及在最多k种估值时存在(1-ε)-EFX分配且慈善物品数量为Õ(√(k/ε))。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中不可分割物品的公平分配问题，特别是在具有不同估值函数的情况下实现近似无嫉妒分配，这是计算公平性领域的重要挑战。

Method: 通过理论分析和组合优化方法，扩展了EFX（任意物品无嫉妒）分配的存在性结果，考虑了不同估值函数的数量限制，并引入了慈善物品的概念来放松分配约束。

Result: 1) 在最多4种不同估值时，存在2/3-EFX分配；2) 在最多k种估值时，存在(1-ε)-EFX分配，慈善物品数量为Õ(√(k/ε))，这改进了之前Õ(√(n/ε))的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了多估值函数场景下的近似EFX分配理论，证明了估值多样性（而非智能体数量）是影响慈善物品复杂度的关键因素，为实际公平分配算法设计提供了理论保证。

Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible goods among
$n$ agents with $k$ distinct additive valuations, with the goal of achieving
approximate envy-freeness up to any good ($\alpha-\mathrm{EFX}$).
  It is known that EFX allocations exist for $n$ agents when there are at most
three distinct valuations due to HV et al. Furthermore, Amanatidis et al.
showed that a $\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation is guaranteed to exist when
number of agents is at most seven. In this paper, we show that a
$\frac{2}{3}-\mathrm{EFX}$ allocation exists for any number of agents when
there are at most four distinct valuations.
  Secondly, we consider a relaxation called $\mathrm{EFX}$ with charity, where
some goods remain unallocated such that no agent envies the set of unallocated
goods. Akrami et al. showed that for $n$ agents and any $\varepsilon \in
\left(0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$, there exists a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((n/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}})$
goods to charity. In this paper, we show that a $(1-\varepsilon)-\mathrm{EFX}$
allocation with a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k/\varepsilon)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ charity
exists for any number of agents when there are at most $k$ distinct valuations.

*Ryota Takeshima,Kei Kimura,Ayumu Kuroki,Temma Wakasugi,Makoto Yokoo*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的公平性概念——局部无嫉妒性，通过只关注学生对熟人的嫉妒来放松公平性约束，从而在保持局部无嫉妒性的同时实现帕累托效率匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双边匹配中效率与公平性存在根本冲突，特别是帕累托效率和正当嫉妒自由性即使在最简单的稳定婚姻问题中也不兼容。以往研究主要通过容忍学生的嫉妒来放松公平性约束，本研究采取了不同的方法。

Method: 假设学生对非熟人的嫉妒影响较小，用无向图表示学生间的相识关系，定义局部嫉妒（对熟人邻居的正当嫉妒），提出局部无嫉妒性作为新的放松公平性概念。分析在特定图结构和学校偏好限制下，能否实现帕累托效率且局部无嫉妒的匹配。

Result: 针对接近树的图结构和单峰偏好，明确了帕累托效率机制能达到的局部无嫉妒性水平。

Conclusion: 通过关注局部嫉妒而非全局嫉妒，可以在保持有意义公平性的同时实现帕累托效率匹配，为效率与公平性的权衡提供了新思路。

Abstract: Two-sided matching, such as matching between students and schools, has been
applied to various aspects of real life and has been the subject of much
research, however, it has been plagued by the fact that efficiency and fairness
are incompatible. In particular, Pareto efficiency and justified-envy-freeness
are known to be incompatible even in the simplest one-to-one matching, i.e.,
the stable marriage problem. In previous research, the primary approach to
improving efficiency in matchings has been to tolerate students' envy, thereby
relaxing fairness constraints. In this study, we take a different approach to
relaxing fairness. Specifically, it focuses on addressing only the envy that
students may experience or prioritize more highly and seeks matchings without
such envy. More specifically, this study assumes that envy towards students who
are not acquaintances has less impact compared to envy towards students who are
acquaintances. Accordingly, we assume that the students know each other or not,
represented by an undirected graph, and define a local envy as a justified envy
toward an acquaintance or a neighbor in the graph. We then propose the property
that there is no local envy as a new relaxed concept of fairness, called local
envy-freeness. We analyze whether Pareto-efficient matching can be achieved
while maintaining local envy-freeness by meaningfully restricting the graph
structure and the school's preferences. To analyze in detail the fairness that
can achieve Pareto-efficient matching, we introduce a local version of the
relaxed fairness recently proposed by Cho et al. (AAMAS 2024), which
parameterizes the level of local envy-freeness by nonnegative integers. We then
clarify the level of local envy-freeness that can be achieved by
Pareto-efficient mechanisms for graphs that are ``close'' to trees and
single-peaked preferences on the graphs.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究多人随机博弈中ε-纳什均衡的计算问题，提出了一个FNP^NP时间算法来近似计算满足约束条件的纳什均衡，并证明了相关复杂性结果和下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多人随机博弈中，精确计算纳什均衡是∃ℝ-完全的，计算复杂度很高。因此需要研究ε-纳什均衡作为近似解，以降低计算复杂度。

Method: 首先证明约束纳什均衡存在时，存在一个非零概率至少为输入双指数倒数的均衡策略。然后使用浮点数表示编码策略，最终设计出FNP^NP时间算法。

Result: 提出了解决承诺问题的FNP^NP算法，证明了决策版本是NP难的，并展示了概率下界：存在策略概率为双指数小的约束纳什均衡。

Conclusion: ε-纳什均衡为近似计算纳什均衡提供了可行的途径，但最优策略可能包含极小的概率值，这限制了某些计算技术的效果。

Abstract: A strategy profile in a multi-player game is a Nash equilibrium if no player
can unilaterally deviate to achieve a strictly better payoff. A profile is an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium if no player can gain more than $\epsilon$ by
unilaterally deviating from their strategy. In this work, we use
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibria to approximate the computation of Nash equilibria.
Specifically, we focus on turn-based, multiplayer stochastic games played on
graphs, where players are restricted to stationary strategies -- strategies
that use randomness but not memory.
  The problem of deciding the constrained existence of stationary Nash
equilibria -- where each player's payoff must lie within a given interval -- is
known to be $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete in such a setting (Hansen and
S{\o}lvsten, 2020). We extend this line of work to stationary $\epsilon$-Nash
equilibria and present an algorithm that solves the following promise problem:
given a game with a Nash equilibrium satisfying the constraints, compute an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium that $\epsilon$-satisfies those same constraints --
satisfies the constraints up to an $\epsilon$ additive error. Our algorithm
runs in FNP^NP time.
  To achieve this, we first show that if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists,
then one exists where the non-zero probabilities are at least an inverse of a
double-exponential in the input. We further prove that such a strategy can be
encoded using floating-point representations, as in the work of Frederiksen and
Miltersen (2013), which finally gives us our FNP^NP algorithm.
  We further show that the decision version of the promise problem is NP-hard.
Finally, we show a partial tightness result by proving a lower bound for such
techniques: if a constrained Nash equilibrium exists, then there must be one
that where the probabilities in the strategies are double-exponentially small.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要嵌入稳健的伦理推理来确保安全性和运输效率，特别是在紧急情况下做出符合道德规范的决策

Method: 分层安全强化学习框架：决策层使用包含碰撞概率和伤害严重性的伦理风险成本训练Safe RL代理；执行层使用多项式路径规划和PID+Stanley控制器实现平滑轨迹；采用动态优先经验回放机制强化高风险事件学习

Result: 在包含多种车辆、骑行者和行人的真实交通数据集上验证，显示该方法在降低伦理风险和保持驾驶性能方面优于基线方法

Conclusion: 这是首个在真实场景中通过安全强化学习研究自动驾驶伦理决策的工作，结合形式控制理论和数据驱动学习有望推动复杂人车混行环境中的伦理责任自主性

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了个性化肺癌风险预测系统，通过FAISS相似性搜索和LLM推理动态选择最佳模型，解决不同病人群体的风险预测挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于患者群体和临床环境的差异性，没有单一模型能在所有群体中都表现最佳，需要个性化的风险预测方案

Method: 两阶段流水线：首先使用FAISS相似性搜索在9个多样化实际群体中识别最相关病人群体，然后用LLM根据检索到的群体和性能指标推荐最佳预测算法

Conclusion: 该个性化风险预测组件提供了一种灵活的方法，能够在多样化临床群体中实现个体化风险评估，为真实世界肺癌筛查提供实用路径

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间无限制导致过于庞大和冗余，现有RL模型无法有效导航，扁平架构搜索导致搜索空间混乱难以遍历。

Method: 引入架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间，采用Q-learning自适应变异策略，根据先前迭代的性能反馈动态调整，实现完全概率化搜索空间探索。

Result: 在数据库ID预测任务中持续发现高性能架构，在Spider数据集上测试准确率相比现有基线方法提升8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于分布式学习、联邦学习、众包和传感器网络等实际应用场景，其中样本可能以不同但已知的概率被独立腐败，而现有的鲁棒估计方法通常假设均匀或最坏情况腐败，忽略了结构性异构。

Method: 采用极小极大分析框架，针对不同的分布类型（多元有界分布、单变量高斯分布、多元高斯分布）和线性回归问题，推导最优估计器的性能界限。

Result: 获得了所有异构腐败模式下的紧致极小极大率，发现最优估计器可能会丢弃超过特定腐败阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的腐败率经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 该研究为异构腐败环境下的鲁棒估计提供了理论基础和性能界限，揭示了样本选择阈值的重要性，对实际应用具有指导意义。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

Method: 采用梯度解耦（绝对差异损失替代log-sigmoid）、偏移约束加正正则化保持质量、梯度分离实现可控拒绝抑制

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均实现了性能提升

Conclusion: LPO是一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，已开源代码、模型和训练数据

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式近似而非梯度，提供更好的计算效率和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基差分隐私方法（如DP-SGD）需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且稳定性差，特别是在多用户环境和存在环境噪声的情况下表现不佳

Method: SPOF通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式近似来私有化模型训练损失函数，每个用户的数据通过向多项式系数添加校准噪声来实现隐私保护

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，在多用户环境中展现出更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: SPOF提供了一种更高效、更稳定的多用户本地差分隐私训练方案，对训练过程中的环境噪声具有鲁棒性，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升了性能

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表征，忽略了物品表征和用户-物品交叉表征的价值，且简单将用户表征作为下游特征使用，未能有效弥合上下游差距和利用更多迁移粒度

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移所有可用表征（URs、IRs、CRs）；2）识别最佳提取层并聚合CRs为可迁移粗粒度形式；3）通过非线性适配器（特征级）、同构交互模块（模块级）和独立检索（模型级）实现多粒度迁移

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表征迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业规模广告推荐中实现了显著的业务效果提升，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展和自适应的量子序列学习开辟了新途径

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often
task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE是一种课程引导的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自编码器，用于修复大气遥感数据中的精细特征，同时提供像素级不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据修复方法会模糊精细尺度结构，而深度学习模型缺乏置信度估计，需要一种既能恢复精细特征又能量化不确定性的方法。

Method: 采用课程引导的掩码比例训练策略，通过蒙特卡洛随机掩码实现集成推断，使用ViT解码器从稀疏上下文中重建，并通过多次评估聚合输出来获得后验预测均值和不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真重建，支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

TL;DR: 该论文针对神经算子理论实践差距问题，提出了生成式平衡算子(GEOs)方法，使用有限维深度平衡层来近似无限维凸优化问题的解，证明了在紧凑集上可实现对数级增长的参数复杂度逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子的理论最坏情况参数边界与实际实验效果存在显著差距，理论要求参数数量过大而实践中却表现良好。本文旨在弥合这一差距，特别是在解决凸优化问题族时。

Method: 提出生成式平衡算子(GEOs)，使用有限维深度平衡层来处理可分离希尔伯特空间上的凸优化问题。输入为光滑凸损失函数，输出为对应的近似最优解。

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子理论要求与实践表现之间的差距，为无限维凸优化问题的求解提供了高效且理论保证的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决大型机器学习模型分布式分区问题，提供自动化且高性能的解决方案

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络的黑盒特性降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等关键应用中的可信度，且现有解释技术难以可靠量化原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过减少片段间消息传递的模型架构，估计片段对输出的因果影响。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

*Carlos Stein Brito*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Twin-Boot是一种新的梯度下降方法，通过在并行训练的两个模型上使用自举采样和周期性均值重置来估计不确定性，从而改善深度学习的校准性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法衡量置信度，在过参数化和数据稀缺的情况下容易过拟合。传统的自举方法在深度学习中不实用，需要训练多个副本且无法指导学习过程。

Method: 训练两个相同模型在独立的自举样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一优化盆地中，利用它们的差异来估计局部不确定性，并在训练过程中使用这种估计进行自适应权重采样。

Result: 该方法在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中改善了校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功地将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，为深度学习提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Conclusion: 联邦学习在线性参数化非线性系统辨识中具有显著优势，通过多客户端协作和合适的特征映射选择，可以有效提升系统辨识的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集规模的增长，训练计算成本显著增加。传统层冻结方法中，冻结层仍需前向传播来生成特征图，限制了计算成本的降低。先前提出的特征图缓存方法虽然理论上可行，但在实际应用中面临增强应用困难和存储开销大的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面探索了层冻结缓存方法中的关键挑战，并提供了系统性解决方案，为高效DNN训练提供了实用的优化策略。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Conclusion: MAL框架通过整合多重归因视角，能够更好地抓取用户转化的深层模式，同时保持与产业部署要求的直接兼容性，为CVR预测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: NGN-M算法成功解决了优化器对步长超参数敏感的问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了稳定性，为深度学习优化提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在减少神经元多义性方面的效果，提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，并开发了新的干预方法APP，在精准概念控制方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中神经元的多义性（一个神经元对多个不相关概念激活）是模型可解释性的主要障碍。虽然稀疏自编码器被提出用于缓解这一问题，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的细粒度概念可分离性评分，评估SAE在减少多义性方面的效果。提出两种干预策略：全神经元掩码和部分抑制，并开发了基于后验概率的衰减方法(APP)。

Result: SAE确实减少了多义性并实现了更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的可分离性，且常常损害下游性能。与基础模型相比，SAE在使用部分抑制时能实现更精确的概念级控制。APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器在提高神经元可解释性方面有效，但需要在稀疏性和性能之间取得平衡。新提出的APP方法为精准概念干预提供了有效工具，推动了语言模型的可控性和可解释性研究。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

*Siddharth Chaudhary,Bennett Browning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra是一个1.6B参数的混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合技术，使用Mamba SSM主干网络、间歇性全局注意力、分块MoE前馈路由和双记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长上下文语言模型在效率和容量方面的挑战，需要开发一种能够结合状态空间模型效率、稀疏注意力选择性和MoE扩展性的模块化架构。

Method: 采用Mamba SSM作为主干，集成间歇性稀疏全局注意力、分块级MoE前馈路由、工作空间记忆和事实PKM记忆的双记忆系统，并设计了分阶段课程训练策略。

Result: 通过小规模原型验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行大规模性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型提供了一条技术路径，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来大规模实验工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，发现概念擦除技术(CETs)存在易被规避、影响邻近概念、属性泄露等副作用，揭示了当前CETs方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术(CETs)被开发出来。但需要系统评估这些技术的鲁棒性和副作用。

Method: 提出了SEE评估基准，包含分层和组合提示词的数据集，通过自动化评估管道从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄露。

Result: 实验表明CETs可以通过超类-子类层次结构和语义相似提示词轻易规避，存在属性泄露问题，并表现出注意力集中或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重的安全漏洞和副作用，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习普及和数据隐私法规发展，从训练模型中移除私有或受版权保护信息的需求日益重要。现有方法通常需要访问完整训练数据集，但在实际场景中原始数据可能无法获取。

Method: 基于最近研究，提出了一种方法能够估计未知剩余训练数据的Hessian矩阵，这是高效无学习的关键组件。利用这种估计技术，实现高效的零样本无学习。

Result: 在广泛数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够在保持剩余数据性能的同时提供稳健的理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了源自由设置下的无学习挑战，为实际应用场景中的隐私保护和版权管理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架缺乏统一的数学基础，无法充分表达复杂的异步分布式计算模式。作者旨在通过范畴论和余代数理论为RL建立更强大、更通用的理论基础。

Method: 使用范畴和函子对RL进行建模，将MDP、POMDP等动态系统表示为特殊类型的余代数。引入Bertsekas和Tsitsiklis的异步分布式最小化标准模型，将RL中的固定点寻找问题推广为在并行分布式环境中异步确定最终余代数。

Result: 建立了RL算法的函子范畴模型，其中余范畴形成拓扑斯，具有所有(余)极限、子对象分类器和指数对象。扩展了先前研究的动态系统模型家族。

Conclusion: 范畴论和余代数理论为强化学习提供了强大的统一框架，能够处理更广泛的异步并行分布式计算场景，将传统RL问题提升到更抽象的数学层次。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Conclusion: 提出了获得科学有效和可靠结果的最佳实践，强调了DPML领域需要更严格的复现性标准和统一的评估框架

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于遗忘学习的新型防御框架，通过三阶段流程检测有害输出、定位有害知识并进行约束优化，有效降低越狱攻击成功率同时保持模型通用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过LLM的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害内容，严重威胁大语言模型的安全性。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 混合方法动态检测不安全输出；2) 通过FFN激活进行词级有害内容追踪定位有害知识；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量。

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中，SafeLLM显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持高通用性能，相比标准防御方法提供更强的安全保证和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是构建可扩展且有效的LLM安全性的有前景方向，SafeLLM实现了有针对性和不可逆的遗忘，同时保持模型整体性能。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个综合性的基准测试框架，有助于系统化评估公平性预处理方法的效果，推动数据层面公平性研究的发展。

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了维度灾难问题，显著增强了TNN在高维多尺度问题中的表现，为复杂高维问题的求解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效平衡准确性和可解释性，提供可扩展的帕累托最优解释合成方案。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多窗口对比学习框架，通过从每个ECG实例中提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，学习时间不变性和生理学意义的特征，在PTB-XL数据集上实现了更好的分类性能，同时显著减少了预训练时间和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录中丰富的时间结构信息，限制了模型性能。

Method: 采用多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例中提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计方法最大化它们的一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理鼓励模型学习时间不变的特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类任务中，AUROC达到0.891（相比基线0.888），F1分数0.680（相比基线0.679），预训练轮次减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了一个有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1等性能指标相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性和关系类型基数等指标与性能呈强负相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中的稳定性和泛化预测能力不成立，需要更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Conclusion: ExBigBang通过整合多模态数据和可解释技术，为人物角色分类提供了更准确和可理解的解决方案，能够更好地反映用户行为的动态变化。

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Conclusion: 用户端的数据重标记是提升模型公平性的有效途径，通过协调行动可以在不改变企业训练流程的情况下实现公平性改进，为偏见缓解提供了新的可行方案

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

TL;DR: EvoFormer是一个用于动态图级表示学习的Transformer框架，通过结构感知和时间敏感模块解决结构访问偏差和突变演化盲点问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图嵌入方法存在两个关键但未被充分探索的问题：结构访问偏差（随机游走采样过度强调高节点度导致冗余噪声）和突变演化盲点（刚性时间建模策略无法有效检测突然结构变化）。

Method: 提出EvoFormer框架，包含：1）结构感知Transformer模块，基于节点结构角色引入位置编码；2）演化敏感时间模块，通过三步策略：随机游走时间戳分类、图级时间分割、段感知时间自注意力结合边演化预测任务。

Conclusion: EvoFormer通过纠正结构和时间偏差，有效解决了动态图嵌入中的关键挑战，验证了其在捕捉结构演化趋势方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI
datasets. While computationally intensive due to overlap condition
calculations, the proposed method demonstrates significant advantages in
decentralized data processing.

Motivation: DeepONet输出相对于分支网络最后一层参数是线性的，这些参数可以用最小二乘法优化，但直接构建完整的线性系统计算量过大不可行

Method: 将大型最小二乘系统分解为分支网络和主干网络两个更小的子问题分别求解，可推广到带正则化项的L2损失函数，包括物理信息无监督学习

Result: 该方法能够有效处理原本计算量过大的线性系统，使DeepONet训练加速

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法成功解决了DeepONet训练中的计算瓶颈问题，为高效训练提供了可行方案

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

Conclusion: 证明了在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量且有效的个性化是可行的，为可扩展的用户感知HAR系统铺平道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Method: 设计了一种专门检测重叠而非差异的相异性度量方法，计算速度更快，能够避免正交簇的错误合并

Result: 该方法比对比方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类，同时避免正交簇的错误合并

Conclusion: 提出的重叠检测方法为在线数据流学习中的聚类合并提供了高效准确的解决方案，特别适合处理概念漂移的流数据环境

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上评估，BaVerLy将常见的逐一验证方法平均扩展了2.3倍，最高达到4.1倍，将总分析时间从24小时减少到6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过群组验证方法有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率，为大规模输入集的鲁棒性分析提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，在两个基本药物发现任务上都表现出显著优势

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Motivation: 解决分布式学习中计算和通信效率低下的问题，特别是在无向网络环境下需要同时优化本地计算成本和通信开销。

Method: 设计ADMM-based算法，使用随机梯度进行本地训练，在通信轮次间执行多轮训练epoch，并采用压缩传输技术减少通信量。

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is
jointly computation- and communication-efficient. Our design guarantees
computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during
local training. Moreover, communication efficiency is achieved as follows: i)
the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

Motivation: 解决工业泵系统中故障数据稀缺、早期故障难以检测的问题，提高预防性维护能力

Method: 采用异常需要双阈值标签方法（固定工程限制+历史数据95%分位数），注入预先制定的合成故障信号，使用随机森林、XGBoost和SVM三种分类器进行训练

Conclusion: 该混合方法提供了稳健的检测能力，具有可扩展性、可解释性和实时工业部署适用性，可逆向于其他相似传感器架构的机械设备

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RoPE方法在完全转导设置下运行，需要在推理时访问批量测试样本，这限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 集成校准和分布对齐的端到端可训练模型，利用小批量最优传输与闭式耦合对齐真实和模拟观测，使用条件归一化流近似OT诱导的后验分布。

Conclusion: 该方法在具有挑战性的错误指定环境中提供了改进的可扩展性和适用性，同时保持了优异的推理性能。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面一致优于动态主题模型，能够在线捕捉主题变化，学习更多样化的主题并更好地捕捉时间变化

Conclusion: CoNTM填补了持续学习主题模型的空白，能够有效实现不遗忘的持续主题学习

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码和解码的联合设计，成功实现了无监督的图节点异常检测，在多尺度频谱分析方面表现出色。

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical

capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，能够产生经验上公平且准确的模型，比基于认证训练的方法更高效

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习训练过程提供了形式化的个体公平性保证，解决了现有方法缺乏正式保证的问题，同时保持了模型性能

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Conclusion: 该环境为在开放式多自主代理设置中研究社交智能AI代理的发展提供了基础，并考察了合作与竞争在此环境中的作用

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive

### [85] [Investigation of D-Wave quantum annealing for training Restricted Boltzmann Machines and mitigating catastrophic forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15697)
*Abdelmoula El-Yazizi,Yaroslav Koshka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了D-Wave量子退火器与经典MCMC采样在受限玻尔兹曼机中的性能差异，发现差异不足以改善RBM训练，但展示了量子采样在缓解灾难性遗忘方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释先前研究中D-Wave量子退火器在RBM训练中未能带来显著改进的原因，并探索结合经典和量子采样的混合方法是否能够受益于两者之间的差异。

Method: 采用混合采样方法，结合经典MCMC和量子退火采样，分析两种方法在概率分布不同区域的采样性能差异，并测试在灾难性遗忘缓解中的应用。

Result: 量子采样与经典采样在中等至低概率区域存在差异，但这些差异对RBM训练质量影响不大。量子采样在生成大量不同期望模式方面速度更快，在灾难性遗忘缓解中表现出与经典方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: 虽然量子采样未能改善RBM训练，但在生成多样化样本和缓解灾难性遗忘方面显示出潜力，为具有挑战性的机器学习应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种通信高效的分布式训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和2位量化实现1-3%的极端压缩比，在带宽受限环境下优于全精度DiLoCo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练方法在带宽受限环境（如跨数据中心）中仍存在通信瓶颈，且性能略低于标准AdamW DDP基线，需要更高效的压缩方法。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈，实现稀疏聚合来提升模型性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面都显示出显著优势，达到1-3%稀疏度和2位量化的极端压缩。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo通过创新的稀疏化和量化技术，有效解决了分布式LLM训练中的通信瓶颈问题，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在表示空间中基于似然的OOD检测性能，通过训练变分扩散模型在ResNet-18表示空间上进行评估，并与最先进方法比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管似然在理论上是最优的OOD检测器，但在实践中经常失败，研究旨在确定这是像素空间的问题还是表示空间也存在密度估计困难。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上，而不是在图像像素空间上，使用似然作为OOD分数，并与OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较。

Result: 通过实验评估表示空间中基于似然的OOD检测性能，具体结果需要查看完整论文。

Conclusion: 研究验证了在表示空间中使用似然进行OOD检测的可行性，为改进OOD检测方法提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作多智能体强化学习系统中对抗攻击的检测问题，特别是在连续动作空间环境下，需要一种能够仅依赖局部观测的去中心化检测方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络近似智能体正常行为的参数化多元高斯分布，基于预测密度函数定义正态性评分，并采用双侧CUSUM程序实时检测评分偏离均值的异常行为。

Result: 在多个多智能体PettingZoo基准测试中，针对不同最先进攻击方法进行评估，检测方法表现出色，对最具影响力攻击的AUC-ROC分数超过0.95，在所有评估环境中均优于离散对应方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测连续动作空间多智能体系统中的对抗攻击，实现了高性能的实时异常行为检测，为协作多智能体系统的安全性提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的神经符号推理模型将谱图方法作为边缘组件，本文让整个推理流程都在图谱域形成，以实现更好的逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图谱信号，使用可学习的谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，并映射到符号谓词进行规则推理，包括图弗里叶变换、带选择性注意力和谱规则基础

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等标准推理数据集上，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面超过了现有最优神经符号模型

Conclusion: 图谱信号处理为稳健和可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础坚实且计算高效的底层支撑

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

Motivation: 传统强化学习将状态表示和奖励函数作为世界模型的两个独立组成部分，但本文探索这两种方面如何从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现的可能性。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态的概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别，通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计差异来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性世界模型方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解跨不同基质的目的性行为提供了一个统一的解释，挑战了传统强化学习中状态表示和奖励函数分离的经典观点。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众但优质的旅游目的地得到关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成城市建议，然后通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商整合，惩罚重复或无关响应。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，Collab-REC相比单智能体基线提高了推荐多样性和整体相关性，成功挖掘出常被忽视的小众旅游地点。

Conclusion: 多利益相关方协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、情境感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

Motivation: 现有群体动画模型主要依靠转向和固定高级目标推断，缺乏语言和对话驱动的复杂社交互动，导致代理人之间的交互有限

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM的语言处理能力，实现了更现实的群体动画模拟，使得代理人能够基于感知输入和进行中的对话来做出运动决策，从而产生自然活现的群体行为

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和行星健康领域，系统评估不同推理预算下LLM的置信度校准表现，比较纯推理和搜索增强生成方法

Result: 推理LLM在专家置信度评估中达到48.7%准确率，但增加推理预算会导致系统性过度自信，搜索增强生成方法达到89.3%准确率

Conclusion: 信息访问而非推理深度或推理预算，是知识密集型任务置信度校准的关键瓶颈

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于显式奖励信号或学习到的价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈时难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种仅通过分析策略分布就能提取有意义行为洞察的方法。

Method: 受智能体倾向于追求收敛工具价值的现象启发，引入ICVs方法。该方法基于信息论Shapley值，通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来量化每个智能体对队友工具赋能的因果影响。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的行动效果，该方法识别出哪些智能体行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动选择的灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为合作动态提供了新颖的洞察，并增强了MARL系统的可解释性，有助于可靠地部署多智能体强化学习系统。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）在增强LLM能力的同时可能损害安全对齐性，导致不安全行为。现有安全适应方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1）引入MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2）设计SSI指标检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3）对这些层进行后剪枝以降低风险

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改进效用指标，并显著降低推理成本

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Motivation: 劳动力管理在执行时需要适应变化并为所有利益相关者提供解释，传统方法难以满足这些需求

Method: 将劳动力管理问题建模为抽象论证框架，通过形式化论证来处理变更和生成解释

Result: 用户研究表明，该工具和解释方法比传统手工解决方案能带来更快、更准确的问题解决效果

Conclusion: 抽象论证框架为工业劳动力管理提供了有效的变更适应机制和可信解释能力，显著优于传统方法

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

Motivation: 解决具身AI代理需要推断和响应未预定义的人类多样化目标和偏好的挑战，特别是在开放且不断变化的目标空间中。

Method: GOOD方法：使用LLM模拟具有不同复杂意图的用户，通过对话提取自然语言目标，并进行概率推理来推断目标分布，无需大型离线数据集。

Result: 在基于文本的杂货购物领域和AI2Thor模拟家庭机器人环境中，使用合成用户配置文件进行评估，GOOD方法在LLM和人类评估中均优于无显式目标跟踪的基线。

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够有效处理开放宇宙中的目标推断问题，提供丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，在有限数据情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: 为AI科学家建立了下一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为开源GUI代理框架设立了新的性能标杆，通过创新的基础设施和能力集成实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模合成可验证的数学逻辑谜题数据集，通过编码种子谜题、随机化变量和约束、以及复制验证机制，构建了83K+多样化谜题，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数学逻辑数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量可验证的数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 使用可满足性模理论(SMT)框架，将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范，通过系统变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，并通过复制机制确保有效性。

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化程序验证谜题的基准测试集，后训练使PuzzleClone平均分从14.4提升至56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上实现最高12.5个百分点的绝对提升。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够有效生成大规模高质量可验证数学逻辑数据，显著提升LLM的推理性能，为增强模型逻辑数学能力提供了可靠的数据解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在罕见病应用受限，因为罕见病数据稀缺且不可靠。多汗症影响2-3%人口但缺乏专门的LLM支持，需要解决这一空白。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用前沿LLM生成医学可信的合成数据增强数据集；2) 在开源基础模型上进行微调；3) 临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和同理心，验证响应迭代丰富数据集。

Result: 实验显示LLM4Sweat优于基线模型，成为首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，为其他罕见病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了罕见病数据稀缺问题，提供了可信赖的医疗支持，具有向其他类似罕见病推广的潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对大语言模型在高约束条件下的推理可靠性缺乏充分评估，特别是在资源约束项目调度这类NP完全问题中。

Method: 构建可扩展的R-ConstraintBench框架，在DAG中逐步增加非冗余的前序约束、停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中进行实例化评估。

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近上限，但当停机时间、时间窗口和析取约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在约束交互场景下泛化能力有限，干净合成数据的性能不能保证在实际领域场景中的迁移效果。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在照片真实感方面表现出色，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表的需求，需要开发能够保持结构精确性的生成方法。

Method: 训练免费的智能代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)，通过迭代循环：批判VLM提出定性编辑建议，多个候选LLM合成SVG更新，评判VLM选择最佳候选，确保稳定改进。

Result: 在10个源自已发表论文流程图的草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更忠实地重建布局和结构，准确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法优先考虑定性推理而非脆弱的数值估计，保持全局约束，支持人机协同修正，输出为可编程SVG，易于通过API扩展到演示工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 约束松弛技术能够在保持实际约束的同时实现更广泛的解空间探索，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，支持快速城市化地区更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Motivation: 现有记忆模块如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响回忆性能和响应质量，需要更好地处理交互过程中产生的大量历史数据。

Method: 设计了受认知心理学启发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。在检索阶段匹配最相关的检索记忆单元，获取对应的上下文记忆作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性，消融实验确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量和存储开销的稳健性。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够有效构建高质量的长期记忆内容，提高回忆性能和响应质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

Method: 提出粗粒度到细粒度的记忆框架：1）将环境信息转化为粗粒度焦点指导经验收集；2）从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示；3）推理时检索任务相关经验和提示；4）面对异常时进行细粒度自我问答反思和计划修正。

Result: 该方法能够更充分地利用记忆信息，提高LLM智能体在不同场景下的适应性和规划灵活性，特别是在处理环境异常时表现出更好的自我修正能力。

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中提供了更强大的记忆支持能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Motivation: 离线强化学习需要良好定义的奖励函数但设计困难，人类反馈中专家演示成本高且模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配不明确

Method: SPW方案：在偏好标注轨迹中搜索与专家演示最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效联合学习偏好和演示，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于同时利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW成功统一了两种人类反馈源，解决了传统方法难以实现的准确信用分配问题

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策，包含修订需求，并具备环境感知能力以确保计划可行性。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架达到了2.72%的通过率，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架为解决这一问题提供了有前景的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集改善了旅行规划系统的实用性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel

### [111] [DiagECG: An LLM-Driven Framework for Diagnostic Reasoning via Discretized ECG Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15338)
*Jinning Yang,Wen Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiagECG是一个将12导联心电图信号与语言模型结合的框架，通过离散化ECG嵌入为符号标记，使大语言模型能够处理ECG信号并生成临床文本，在多项任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力有限，且缺乏开放式推理支持，需要一种能够统一处理ECG信号和自然语言的解决方案。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多项任务中实现了强劲性能，并保持了在分布外设置下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLM中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

practice to generate plans that balance both objectives.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business
applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent

environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Think in Blocks框架，通过将推理过程划分为可调节的块数，使LLM能够根据任务复杂度动态调整推理长度，避免过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的思维链推理在处理复杂逻辑任务时表现良好，但过长的推理链会导致计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理深度。

Method: 建立块结构范式：预测推理预算（块数）并按块划分推理；三阶段训练流程：监督微调、奖励引导的直接偏好优化、强化学习；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制深度。

Result: 实现了自适应推理能力，模型能够根据问题难度调整推理深度，从零推理到深度推理灵活可调。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过块结构化和自适应训练实现了推理长度的动态控制，提升了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主人工智能代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。受超加性合作理论启发，该理论认为重复互动和群体间竞争的联合效应是人类合作倾向的原因。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型智能体分组进行囚徒困境博弈，模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 发现内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提升了整体合作水平和一次性互动的初始合作倾向。

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中的策略制定提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争反直觉地能导致更多合作行为，对设计未来多智能体AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D推理任务的问题过于简单，生成的程序推理链较短，无法满足复杂3D场景的推理需求

Result: 增强了大型语言模型在复杂3D场景中的工具使用能力，提高了复杂任务的准确性

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM在复杂3D推理任务中的表现，为3D场景理解提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要新的框架来验证学习策略的鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并开发MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量指标。

Result: 框架能够识别不安全区域周围的安全屏障和系统收敛特性，成功发现仅基于奖励看似成功策略中的关键缺陷。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了全面且可解释的策略行为评估，能够处理模型不确定性，为安全关键系统中的RL应用提供形式化验证方法。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

Motivation: 为了解决传统AI工作流中过度依赖提示工程的问题，提供一个更注重数据建模的框架，使开发者能够通过声明式语言构建AI应用。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI开发提供了新的数据建模范式，通过逻辑转换和组合泛化实现了高效且可扩展的代理系统构建。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，已成功适配到Lisp ACT-R中，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发向量符号替代方案来改进ACT-R的声明性记忆系统，获得更好的可扩展性和相似性处理能力，同时保持与现有模型的兼容性。

Method: 将HDM适配到Lisp ACT-R中，开发基于向量的常见ACT-R函数，建立文本处理流水线，创建基于向量表示的完整记忆块检索机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM保持了向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的回忆能力），同时使现有ACT-R模型只需很少或无需修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号记忆系统与ACT-R的集成，未来将改进时间上下文表示并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统中数据的动态生成特性和递归价值链，特别是从数据摄入到部署的完整生命周期如何产生自我强化的价值积累和技术寡头垄断。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，构建AI生命周期的理论模型，包括前个体环境、个体化和个体化AI三个阶段，并提出"未来性"概念描述AI的自我强化循环。

Result: 识别了监管盲点，揭示了AI基础设施（如特征存储）如何通过反馈、适应和时间递归实现数据非竞争性的递归生成，导致权力不对称加剧和技术寡头价值集中。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI应用的加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但目前缺乏在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标的研究。

Method: 提出并执行了全面的测量方法，包括AI加速器功耗、主机系统能耗、空闲机器容量和数据中心能耗开销的全栈测量，通过在谷歌Gemini AI助手基础设施上进行详细仪器化测量。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示的中位数能耗为0.24Wh，用水量为0.26mL；谷歌的软件效率改进和清洁能源采购在一年内使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹减少44倍；AI提示的能耗低于观看9秒电视。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务的环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注；全面的环境指标测量对于准确比较模型和激励全栈效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法缺乏可解释性且处理维度独立，自动化方法难以动态适应和语义推理

Method: 使用多智能体LLM框架：顾问提出配置变更、评估器评估进展、优化器精化决策过程，结合文本梯度提供定性反馈信号

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的推理和文本梯度，有效解决了配置优化的语义理解和动态适应问题，为机器学习配置优化提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

TL;DR: DeepNaniNet是一个基于深度神经网络的推荐框架，通过图架构和BERT文本嵌入解决小众动态社区的冷启动和数据稀疏问题，在多个基准测试中取得最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对小众动态社区推荐系统面临的数据稀疏、冷启动用户/物品和隐私约束等挑战，传统协同过滤和基于内容的方法在这些场景下表现不佳。

Method: 采用归纳式图架构，结合用户-物品交互、物品-物品关系和BERT生成的丰富文本评论嵌入，使用新颖的"内容篮子"用户表示和基于自动编码器的泛化策略处理未见用户。

Result: 在CiteULike基准测试中取得最先进的冷启动结果，在AnimeULike数据集上比WMF和DropoutNet在Recall@100指标上分别提升7倍和1.5倍，且在不损害性能的情况下匹配DropoutNet的用户召回率。

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet能够在数据稀疏、冷启动严重的环境中提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，同时有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了COSETTE对比标记化方法和MARIUS轻量级生成模型，解决了生成式推荐系统中协作信号缺失和架构效率低的问题，在保持生成范式优势的同时缩小了与ID基模型的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统虽然将推荐任务重构为序列生成问题，但在实践中往往表现不如传统的ID基模型（如SASRec）。主要存在两个关键限制：项目标记化中缺乏协作信号，以及编码器-解码器架构的效率低下。

Method: 1. COSETTE：对比标记化方法，将协作信息直接整合到学习到的项目表示中，联合优化内容重建和推荐相关性
2. MARIUS：轻量级音频启发生成模型，将时间线建模与项目解码解耦

Result: 在标准序列推荐基准测试中，该方法缩小甚至消除了生成式模型与现代ID基模型之间的性能差距，同时保持了生成范式的优势。

Conclusion: 通过引入协作感知的标记化和高效的生成架构，生成式推荐系统可以达到与传统ID基模型相当甚至更好的性能，为推荐系统的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce概率模型的成对比较框架，采用效用驱动的主动采样策略，支持矩阵分解和神经网络两种实现方式

Result: 实验证明该方法在电影推荐和大学招生场景中都能提供更准确、数据高效且用户中心的个性化排序

Conclusion: 该效用优化框架为推荐系统提供了更灵活、实用的偏好学习范式，能够显式对齐应用特定的质量目标

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Conclusion: MSPA框架通过多模态自校正偏好对齐，有效解决了直播推荐中的动态多模态挑战，为个性化作者推荐提供了准确且可解释的解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming platforms, personalized
recommendation systems have become pivotal in improving user experience and
driving platform revenue. The dynamic and multimodal nature of live streaming
content (e.g., visual, audio, textual data) requires joint modeling of user
behavior and multimodal features to capture evolving author characteristics.
However, traditional methods relying on single-modal features or treating
multimodal ones as supplementary struggle to align users' dynamic preferences
with authors' multimodal attributes, limiting accuracy and interpretability. To
address this, we propose MSPA (Multimodal Self-Corrective Preference
Alignment), a personalized author recommendation framework with two components:
(1) a Multimodal Preference Composer that uses MLLMs to generate structured
preference text and embeddings from users' tipping history; and (2) a
Self-Corrective Preference Alignment Recommender that aligns these preferences
with authors' multimodal features to improve accuracy and interpretability.
Extensive experiments and visualizations show that MSPA significantly improves
accuracy, recall, and text quality, outperforming baselines in dynamic live
streaming scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度动机信号提取有效解决了推荐系统中的冷启动和稀疏数据问题，为个性化推荐提供了新思路

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

Abstract: Approximate unlearning for session-based recommendation refers to eliminating
the influence of specific training samples from the recommender without
retraining of (sub-)models. Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to
conduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to
apply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of
GA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,
existing studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when
simultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal
recommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above
challenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework
tailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with
a GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,
CAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization
problem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining
terms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is
solved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective
unlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the
second challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning
on batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning
from easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics
to measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty
and embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and
soft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to
difficulty scores.

Conclusion: MMQ框架成功解决了语义ID在推荐系统中的关键挑战，提供了统一且可扩展的多模态推荐解决方案

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Conclusion: FSAP构成了对神经检索系统的现实且可扩展的威胁，能有效泛化到专有和开源大语言模型

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation typically combines the user behavioral data with
the modal features of items to reveal user's preference, presenting superior
performance compared to the conventional recommendations. However, existing
methods still suffer from two key problems: (1) the initialization methods of
user multimodal representations are either behavior-unperceived or
noise-contaminated, and (2) the KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges
with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To
address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal
recommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the
one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic
descriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of
items. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed
it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference containing
interaction motivations. On the other hand, we design the threshold-controlled
denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal
item-item graph, thereby enhancing the item representation learning. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec
achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53%
over the best baselines.

address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture
user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into
generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.
However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic
representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning
pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these
issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that
constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a
self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.
Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook
(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby
constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance
the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement
stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a
Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions
tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA
introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During
inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed
to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of
erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy
for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online
evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial
practical value.

Conclusion: DiffuMIN通过扩散驱动的多兴趣建模方法，能够更全面地探索用户兴趣空间，有效提升CTR预测效果，在实际工业场景中具有显著应用价值。

Abstract: CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and
online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term
user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of
noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.
Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.
However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,
resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the
complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and
generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest
Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user
interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest
extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain
interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between
interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user
interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and
interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented
interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with
the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted
interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the
generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive
offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial
dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.
Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B
testing. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究证明了CTR模型也存在缩放定律，通过构建高性能可扩展模型并蒸馏到轻量模型的范式，能够有效突破当前CTR模型的性能瓶颈，为在线个性化服务提供新的技术路径

Abstract: CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting
business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR
models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by
the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR
predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the
model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this
model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into
practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention
Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single
UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also
measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple
perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving
the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high
performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long
inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel
inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to
train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The
distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the
LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results
show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning
three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled
LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More
importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online
service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average
inference time acceptable. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐系统中存在幻觉问题，其思维链推理的有效性无法保证，需要提升LLMs通过有效CoT推理来增强推荐能力

Method: 提出TrackRec框架，包含RecCoT生成器(G)和验证器(V)，设计交替反馈学习机制：G通过V的反馈进行直接偏好优化，V通过G的推理反馈进行微调

Result: 大量实验证明该方法超越最先进方法，已在亿级用户的广告平台部署并取得显著收益

Conclusion: TrackRec通过生成器和验证器的交替反馈学习，有效提升了LLMs在推荐系统中的推理能力和推荐性能

Abstract: The extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation
systems (RS). Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to
improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due
to the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no
guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further
enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT
reasonings. Therefore, we propose \textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to
enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on
accurately inferring recommendation CoT \textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference
using the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for
the LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to
assist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks. TrackRec
consists of a RecCoT generator $(G)$ and a RecCoT validator $(V)$. Furthermore,
we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct
preference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate
RecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the
inference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment
with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning
between $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference
analysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a
lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving
substantial gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统将检索和推理分离处理，限制了在复杂任务中的表现。需要研究通过反馈机制实现迭代检索和动态调整的方法。

Method: 调查研究了各种基于反馈的高级检索和排名机制，按照反馈来源和作用对其进行分类。

Result: 结合了信息检索（IR）和自然语言处理（NLP）领域的最新进展，为构建端到端的动态RAG系统提供了结构化视角。

Conclusion: 检索应该被视为一个动态、可学习的组件，通过反馈机制可以显著提升RAG系统在复杂任务上的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了多模态实体链接模型在视觉对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，发现现有模型普遍缺乏足够的抗干扰能力，并提出了一种基于大语言模型和检索增强的实体链接方法LLM-RetLink来显著提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据的爆炸式增长推动了多模态实体链接模型的快速发展，但现有研究尚未系统研究视觉对抗攻击对MEL模型的影响，需要全面评估主流模型在不同对抗攻击场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了LLM-RetLink方法，采用两阶段流程：首先使用大型视觉模型提取初始实体描述，然后通过基于网络的检索动态生成候选描述句子。在五个数据集上进行了实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，当前MEL模型普遍缺乏足够的抗视觉扰动鲁棒性。LLM-RetLink将MEL准确率提高了0.4%-35.7%，在对抗条件下表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了MEL鲁棒性中一个先前未被探索的方面，构建并发布了首个MEL对抗样本数据集，为未来加强多模态系统在对抗环境中的韧性奠定了基础。

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of
multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not
systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL
models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of
mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering
two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental
results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness
against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in
input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on
this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking
(LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference
ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity
descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating
candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five
datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by
0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial
conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL
robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset,
and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of
multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

large-scale e-commerce platform demonstrates statistically significant
improvements, confirming the framework's effectiveness. Currently,
LongRetriever has been fully deployed in the platform, impacting billions of

TL;DR: 本文研究了图书推荐系统中的主题偏见问题，发现内容不平衡和用户参与模式会放大偏见，导致小众兴趣用户获得较差推荐，而多样化兴趣用户获得更一致推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在帮助用户发现新内容的同时，也可能强化现有偏见，导致不公平的曝光和多样性减少。需要研究图书推荐中的主题偏见及其对不同用户群体的影响。

Method: 采用多阶段偏见评估框架，使用Book-Crossing数据集评估推荐系统中的主题偏见，并根据用户主题偏好对用户进行细分分析。

Result: 研究发现主题偏见源于内容不平衡，并被用户参与模式放大。小众和长尾兴趣用户获得的个性化推荐较少，而多样化兴趣用户获得更一致的推荐。

Conclusion: 推荐系统应精心设计以容纳更广泛的用户兴趣范围，这项工作为将主题偏见分析扩展到其他领域奠定了基础，有助于实现负责任AI的更大目标。

Abstract: Recommender systems help users discover new content, but can also reinforce
existing biases, leading to unfair exposure and reduced diversity. This paper
introduces and investigates thematic bias in book recommendations, defined as a
disproportionate favouring or neglect of certain book themes. We adopt a
multi-stage bias evaluation framework using the Book-Crossing dataset to
evaluate thematic bias in recommendations and its impact on different user
groups.
  Our findings show that thematic bias originates from content imbalances and
is amplified by user engagement patterns. By segmenting users based on their
thematic preferences, we find that users with niche and long-tail interests
receive less personalised recommendations, whereas users with diverse interests
receive more consistent recommendations. These findings suggest that
recommender systems should be carefully designed to accommodate a broader range
of user interests. By contributing to the broader goal of responsible AI, this
work also lays the groundwork for extending thematic bias analysis to other
domains.
