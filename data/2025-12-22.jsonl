These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.\n  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.\n  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.\n  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads."}

More is known when the inner product is Euclidean than Hermitian. A shift to the latter is gaining traction. The focus is on a code whose Hermitian hull dimension and dual distance can be systematically determined. Such a code can serve as an ingredient in designing the parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs).\n  We use tools from algebraic function fields of one variable to efficiently determine a good lower bound on the Hermitian hull dimensions of generalized rational algebraic geometry (AG) codes. We identify families of AG codes whose hull dimensions can be well estimated by a lower bound. Given such a code, the idea is to select a set of evaluation points for which the residues of the Weil differential associated with the Hermitian dual code has an easily verifiable property.\n  The approach allows us to construct codes with designed Hermitian hull dimensions based on known results on Reed-Solomon codes and their generalization. Using the Hermitian method on these maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with designed hull dimensions yields two families of MDS EAQECCs. We confirm that the excellent parameters of the quantum codes from these families are new."}

This paper studies quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})$ and proposes various direct construction methods for such matrices. The construction is based on skew polynomial rings $GR(p^{s}, p^{sm})[X;σ]$, whose rich factorization properties and enlarged class of polynomials are used to define companion matrices generating quasi-recursive MDS matrices. First, two criteria are established for characterizing polynomials that yield recursive MDS matrices, generalizing existing results, and then an additional criterion is derived in terms of the right roots of the associated Wedderburn polynomial. Using these criteria, methods are developed to construct skew polynomials that give rise to quasi-recursive MDS matrices over Galois rings. This framework extends known constructions to the non-commutative setting and significantly enlarges the family of available matrices, with potential applications to efficient diffusion layers in cryptographic primitives. The results are particularly relevant for practical implementations when $s = 1$ and $p = 2$, i.e., over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$, which is of central interest in real-world cryptographic applications."}

However, their scalability is limited by the quadratic cost of maintaining dense item-item similarity matrices. Partitioning-based paradigms have recently emerged as an effective strategy for balancing effectiveness and efficiency, enabling models to learn local similarities within coherent subgraphs while maintaining a limited global context. In this work, we focus on the Fine-tuning Partition-aware Similarity Refinement (FPSR) framework, a prominent representative of this family, as well as its extension, FPSR+. Reproducible evaluation of partition-aware collaborative filtering remains challenging, as prior FPSR/FPSR+ reports often rely on splits of unclear provenance and omit some similarity-based baselines, thereby complicating fair comparison. We present a transparent, fully reproducible benchmark of FPSR and FPSR+. Based on our results, the family of FPSR models does not consistently perform at the highest level. Overall, it remains competitive, validates its design choices, and shows significant advantages in long-tail scenarios. This highlights the accuracy-coverage trade-offs resulting from partitioning, global components, and hub design. Our investigation clarifies when partition-aware similarity modeling is most beneficial and offers actionable guidance for scalable recommender system design under reproducible protocols."}

As such allocations may not exist for arbitrary instances, we ask if they exist for \\textit{typical} or \\textit{random} instances, meaning when the utility values of agents for the resources are drawn from certain distributions. If such allocations exist with high probability for typical instances, and furthermore if they can be computed efficiently, this would imply that we could quickly resolve a real world resource allocation scenario in a fair and efficient manner with high probability. This implication has made this setting popular and well studied in fair resource allocation.\n  In this paper, we extend the previously studied formal models of this problem to non-identical items. We assume that every item is associated with a distribution $\\mathcal{U}_j$, and every agent's utility value for the item is drawn independently from $\\mathcal{U}_j$. We show that envy-free fair and maximum social welfare efficient allocations exist with high probability in the asymptotic setting, meaning when the number of agents $n$ and items $m$ are large. Further we show that when $m=O(n\\log n),$ then by only sampling $O(\\log m)$ or $O((\\log m)^2)$ utility values per item instead of all the $n,$ we can compute these allocations in $\\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Finally, we simulate our algorithms on randomly generated instances and show that even for small instances, we suffer small multiplicative losses in the fairness and efficiency guarantees even for small sized instances, and converge to fully optimal guarantees quickly."}

In this paper, we propose Voxel-GS, a simple yet highly effective framework that departs from the complex neural entropy models of prior work, instead achieving competitive performance using only a lightweight rate proxy and run-length coding. Specifically, we employ a differentiable quantization to discretize the Gaussian attributes of Scaffold-GS. Subsequently, a Laplacian-based rate proxy is devised to impose an entropy constraint, guiding the generation of high-fidelity and compact reconstructions. Finally, this integer-type Gaussian point cloud is compressed losslessly using Octree and run-length coding. Experiments validate that the proposed rate proxy accurately estimates the bitrate of run-length coding, enabling Voxel-GS to eliminate redundancy and optimize for a more compact representation. Consequently, our method achieves a remarkable compression ratio with significantly faster coding speeds than prior art. The code is available at https://github.com/zb12138/VoxelGS."}

Instead of relying on supports or anticodes, the weights of a code are defined via the intersections of the code with a chosen family of spaces, which we call a test family. The choice of test family determines the properties of the corresponding generalized weights and the characteristics of the code that they capture. In this general framework, we prove that generalized weights are weakly increasing and that certain subsequences are strictly increasing. We also prove a duality result reminiscent of Wei's Duality Theorem. The corresponding properties of generalized Hamming and rank-metric weights follow from our general results by selecting optimal anticodes as a test family. For sum-rank metric codes, we propose a test family that results in generalized weights that are closely connected to -- but not always the same as -- the usual generalized weights. This choice allows us to extend the known duality results for generalized sum-rank weights to some sum-rank-metric codes with a nonzero Hamming component. Finally, we explore a family of generalized weights obtained by intersecting the underlying code with MDS or MRD codes."}

The recent release of Grokipedia, a fully AI-generated encyclopedia, introduces a new alternative to traditional, well-established platforms like Wikipedia. In this context, search engine mechanisms play an important role in guiding users exploratory paths, yet their behavior across different encyclopedic systems remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by providing the first comparative analysis of search engine in Wikipedia and Grokipedia.\n  Using nearly 10,000 neutral English words and their substrings as queries, we collect over 70,000 search engine results and examine their semantic alignment, overlap, and topical structure. We find that both platforms frequently generate results that are weakly related to the original query and, in many cases, surface unexpected content starting from innocuous queries. Despite these shared properties, the two systems often produce substantially different recommendation sets for the same query. Through topical annotation and trajectory analysis, we further identify systematic differences in how content categories are surfaced and how search engine results evolve over multiple stages of exploration.\n  Overall, our findings show that unexpected search engine outcomes are a common feature of both the platforms, even though they exhibit discrepancies in terms of topical distribution and query suggestions."}

The algorithm has been revised for clarity, and feedback is welcome before final submission to a suitable journal", "summary": "The score set of a tournament is defined as the set of its distinct out-degrees. In 1978, Reid proposed the conjecture that for any set of nonnegative integers $D$, there exists a tournament $T$ with a degree set $D$. In 1989, Yao presented an arithmetical proof of the conjecture, but a general polynomial-time construction algorithm is not known. This paper proposes a necessary and sufficient condition and a separate necessary condition, based on the existing Landau's theorem for the problem of reconstructing score sequences from score sets of tournament graphs. The necessary condition introduces a structured set that enables the use of group-theoretic techniques, offering not only a framework for solving the reconstruction problem but also a new perspective for approaching similar problems. In particular, the same theoretical approach can be extended to reconstruct valid score sets given constraints on the frequency of distinct scores in tournaments. Based on these conditions, we have developed three algorithms that demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: a polynomial-time algorithm and a scalable algorithm for reconstructing score sequences, and a polynomial-time network-building method that finds all possible score sequences for a given score set. Moreover, the polynomial-time algorithm for reconstructing the score sequence of a tournament for a given score set can be used to verify Reid's conjecture. These algorithms have practical applications in sports analysis, ranking prediction, and machine learning tasks such as learning-to-rank models and data imputation, where the reconstruction of partial rankings or sequences is essential for recommendation systems and anomaly detection."}

However, such separate application may lead to semantic misalignment between the expanded queries (or documents) and their relevant documents (or queries). To address this serious issue, we propose TCDE, a dual expansion strategy that leverages large language models (LLMs) for topic-centric enrichment on both queries and documents. In TCDE, we design two distinct prompt templates for processing each query and document. On the query side, an LLM is guided to identify distinct sub-topics within each query and generate a focused pseudo-document for each sub-topic. On the document side, an LLM is guided to distill each document into a set of core topic sentences. The resulting outputs are used to expand the original query and document. This topic-centric dual expansion process establishes semantic bridges between queries and their relevant documents, enabling better alignment for downstream retrieval models. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, TREC Deep Learning and BEIR, demonstrate that TCDE achieves substantial improvements over strong state-of-the-art expansion baselines. In particular, on dense retrieval tasks, it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, with a relative improvement of 2.8\\% in NDCG@10 on the SciFact dataset. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our topic-centric and dual expansion strategy."}

At each step, all neighbors of burning vertices catch fire. A well-studied extension to model fire containment is to allow for fireproofing a number $B$ of non-burning vertices at each step. Interestingly, basic computational questions about this model are computationally hard even on trees. One of the most prominent such examples is Resource Minimization for Fire Containment (RMFC), which asks how small $B$ can be chosen so that a given subset of vertices will never catch fire. Despite recent progress on RMFC on trees, prior work left a significant gap in terms of its approximability. We close this gap by providing an optimal $2$-approximation and an asymptotic PTAS, resolving two open questions in the literature. Both results are obtained in a unified way, by first designing a PTAS for a smooth variant of RMFC, which is obtained through a careful LP-guided enumeration procedure.\n  Moreover, we show that our new techniques, with several additional ingredients, carry over to the non-uniform $k$-center problem (NUkC), by exploiting a link between RMFC on trees and NUkC established by Chakrabarty, Goyal, and Krishnaswamy. This leads to the first approximation algorithm for NUkC that is optimal in terms of the number of additional centers that have to be opened."}

For continuous atomless priors, we identify conditions under which deterministic DSIC auctions are implementationally equivalent to randomized BIC auctions in terms of achievable outcomes.

In this paper, we study the problem of improving RecSys model predictions for cold-start (CS) items, which appear infrequently in the training data. Although this problem is well-studied in academia, few studies have addressed its root causes effectively at the scale of a platform like Pinterest. By investigating live traffic data, we identified several challenges of the CS problem and developed a corresponding solution for each: First, industrial-scale RecSys models must operate under tight computational constraints. Since CS items are a minority, any related improvements must be highly cost-efficient. To address this, our solutions were designed to be lightweight, collectively increasing the total parameters by only 5%. Second, CS items are represented only by non-historical (e.g., content or attribute) features, which models often treat as less important. To elevate their significance, we introduce a residual connection for the non-historical features. Third, CS items tend to receive lower prediction scores compared to non-CS items, reducing their likelihood of being surfaced. We mitigate this by incorporating a score regularization term into the model. Fourth, the labels associated with CS items are sparse, making it difficult for the model to learn from them. We apply the manifold mixup technique to address this data sparsity. Implemented together, our methods increased fresh content engagement at Pinterest by 10% without negatively impacting overall engagement and cost, and have been deployed to serve over 570 million users on Pinterest."}

We present a polynomial-time algorithm for verifying a minimum-weight basis of a matroid, where each weight lies in a given uncertainty area.

A key challenge lies in the large semantic gap between LLMs and RecSys where the former internalizes language world knowledge while the latter captures personalized world of behaviors. Unfortunately, the research community lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over their limitations and boundaries in RecSys so that we can draw a confident conclusion. To investigate this, we propose a benchmark named LRWorld containing over 38K high-quality samples and 23M tokens carefully compiled and generated from widely used public recommendation datasets. LRWorld categorizes the mental world of LLMs in RecSys as three main scales (association, personalization, and knowledgeability) spanned by ten factors with 31 measures (tasks). Based on LRWorld, comprehensive experiments on dozens of LLMs show that they are still not well capturing the deep neural personalized embeddings but can achieve good results on shallow memory-based item-item similarity. They are also good at perceiving item entity relations, entity hierarchical taxonomies, and item-item association rules when inferring user interests. Furthermore, LLMs show a promising ability in multimodal knowledge reasoning (movie poster and product image) and robustness to noisy profiles. None of them show consistently good performance over the ten factors. Model sizes, position bias, and more are ablated."}

To overcome this, BSARec augments the Transformer encoder with a frequency layer that rescales high-frequency components using the Fourier transform. However, the overall effectiveness of BSARec and the roles of its individual components have yet to be systematically validated. We reproduce BSARec and show that it outperforms other SR methods on some datasets. To empirically assess whether BSARec improves performance on high-frequency signals, we propose a metric to quantify user history frequency and evaluate SR methods across different user groups. We compare digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and find that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) offer only slight improvements over Fourier transforms, and DSP methods provide no clear advantage over simple residual connections. Finally, we explore padding strategies and find that non-constant padding significantly improves recommendation performance, whereas constant padding hinders the frequency rescaler's ability to capture high-frequency signals."}

This trade-off has been extensively explored in the literature through a number of problem formulations that differ in the specific job characteristics and the precise objective function. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.\n  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.\n  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable. The latter result highlights the subtle differences between priority and completion orderings for the problem."}

Recently, agentic approaches to these problems have been gaining traction. This work evaluates the behavioural and retention effects of agentic personalisation on a financial service application's customer communication system during a 2025 national tax filing period. Through a two month-long randomised controlled trial, we compare an agentic messaging approach against a business-as-usual (BAU) rule-based campaign system, focusing on two primary outcomes: unsubscribe behaviour and conversion timing. Empirical results show that agent-led messaging reduced unsubscribe events by 21\\% ($\\pm 0.01$) relative to BAU and increased early filing behaviour in the weeks preceding the national deadline. These findings demonstrate how adaptive, user-level decision-making systems can modulate engagement intensity whilst improving long-term retention indicators."}

In C-PVC, we are given a hypergraph with capacities on its vertices and a partition of the hyperedge set into $ω$ distinct groups. The objective is to select a minimum size subset of vertices that satisfies two main conditions: (1) in each group, the total number of covered hyperedges meets a specified threshold, and (2) the number of hyperedges assigned to any vertex respects its capacity constraint. A covered hyperedge is required to be assigned to a selected vertex that belongs to the hyperedge. This formulation generalizes classical Vertex Cover, Partial Vertex Cover, and Partition Vertex Cover.\n  We investigate two primary variants: soft capacitated (multiple copies of a vertex are allowed) and hard capacitated (each vertex can be chosen at most once). Let $f$ denote the rank of the hypergraph. Our main contributions are: $(i)$ an $(f+1)$-approximation algorithm for the weighted soft-capacitated C-PVC problem, which runs in $n^{O(ω)}$ time, and $(ii)$ an $(f+ε)$-approximation algorithm for the unweighted hard-capacitated C-PVC problem, which runs in $n^{O(ω/ε)}$ time.\n  We also study a natural generalization of the edge cover problem, the \\emph{Weighted Partition Edge Cover} (W-PEC) problem, where each edge has an associated weight, and the vertex set is partitioned into groups. For each group, the goal is to cover at least a specified number of vertices using incident edges, while minimizing the total weight of the selected edges. We present the first exact polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted case, improving runtime from $O(ωn^3)$ to $O(mn+n^2 \\log n)$ and simplifying the algorithmic structure over prior unweighted approaches."}

However, common methods largely rely on co-occurrence, making them prone to item popularity bias and user attributes, which degrades embedding quality and performance. Meanwhile, although diversity is acknowledged as a key aspect of recommendation quality, existing research offers limited attention to it, with a notable lack of causal perspectives and theoretical grounding. To address these challenges, we propose Cadence: Diversity Recommendation via Causal Deconfounding of Co-purchase Relations and Counterfactual Exposure - a plug-and-play framework built upon LightGCN as the backbone, primarily designed to enhance recommendation diversity while preserving accuracy. First, we compute the Unbiased Asymmetric Co-purchase Relationship (UACR) between items - excluding item popularity and user attributes - to construct a deconfounded directed item graph, with an aggregation mechanism to refine embeddings. Second, we leverage UACR to identify diverse categories of items that exhibit strong causal relevance to a user's interacted items but have not yet been engaged with. We then simulate their behavior under high-exposure scenarios, thereby significantly enhancing recommendation diversity while preserving relevance. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art diversity models in both diversity and accuracy, and further validates its effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency over baselines."}

Although many symbolic approaches have been presented, transient probability analysis of CRNs, modeled as Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), requires explicit state representation. For that purpose, current cutting-edge methods use hash maps, which boast constant average time complexity and linear memory complexity. However, hash maps often suffer from severe memory limitations on models with immense state spaces. To address this, we propose using prefix trees to store states for large, highly concurrent models (particularly CRNs) for memory savings. We present theoretical analyses and benchmarks demonstrating the favorability of prefix trees over hash maps for very large state spaces. Additionally, we propose using a Bounded Model Checking (BMC) pre-processing step to impose a variable ordering to further improve memory usage along with preliminary evaluations suggesting its effectiveness. We remark that while our work is motivated primarily by the challenges posed by CRNs, it is generalizable to all CTMC models."}
