### [1] [Detecting Notational Errors in Digital Music Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02746)
*Géré Léo,Nicolas Audebert,Florent Jacquemard*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动检测音乐乐谱符号错误的方法，能够精确定位乐谱中的缺陷，包括节奏/时间不一致和上下文错误，并在ASAP钢琴乐谱数据集上应用，发现约40%的乐谱存在符号错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字音乐乐谱质量参差不齐，存在从轻微排版差异到重大符号错误的各种问题，这对音乐信息提取和检索造成了严重影响，需要自动化方法来检测和定位这些错误。

Method: 采用模块化状态机实现上下文错误检测，可以轻松扩展以包含西方音乐常用符号规则，同时检测节奏/时间不一致的编码问题。

Result: 在ASAP钢琴乐谱数据集上应用该方法，发现约40%的乐谱至少包含一个符号错误，并手动修复了多个错误以提升数据集质量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测乐谱符号错误，为音乐信息处理提供了重要的质量控制手段，有助于改善数字音乐乐谱的整体质量。

Abstract: Music scores are used to precisely store music pieces for transmission and
preservation. To represent and manipulate these complex objects, various
formats have been tailored for different use cases. While music notation
follows specific rules, digital formats usually enforce them leniently. Hence,
digital music scores widely vary in quality, due to software and format
specificity, conversion issues, and dubious user inputs. Problems range from
minor engraving discrepancies to major notation mistakes. Yet, data quality is
a major issue when dealing with musical information extraction and retrieval.
We present an automated approach to detect notational errors, aiming at
precisely localizing defects in scores. We identify two types of errors: i)
rhythm/time inconsistencies in the encoding of individual musical elements, and
ii) contextual errors, i.e. notation mistakes that break commonly accepted
musical rules. We implement the latter using a modular state machine that can
be easily extended to include rules representing the usual conventions from the
common Western music notation. Finally, we apply this error-detection method to
the piano score dataset ASAP. We highlight that around 40% of the scores
contain at least one notational error, and manually fix multiple of them to
enhance the dataset's quality.

### [2] [BrowserArena: Evaluating LLM Agents on Real-World Web Navigation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02418)
*Sagnik Anupam,Davis Brown,Shuo Li,Eric Wong,Hamed Hassani,Osbert Bastani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrowserArena是一个实时开放网络代理评估平台，通过收集用户提交的任务、进行Arena式头对头比较，并使用步骤级人工反馈来揭示故障模式。研究发现当前网络代理存在验证码解析、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航三个主要故障模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络代理评估局限于沙盒环境或人工任务，需要真实开放网络环境下的评估平台来发现和解决代理的实际故障模式。

Method: 构建BrowserArena平台，收集用户提交的真实任务，进行头对头代理比较，通过步骤级人工反馈分析代理轨迹，并针对发现的故障模式构建针对性数据集进行深入研究。

Result: 识别出三个一致的故障模式：验证码解析、弹窗横幅移除和直接URL导航。不同语言模型在这些故障模式上表现各异，如o4-mini使用更多策略绕过验证码，而DeepSeek-R1在验证码解析上误导用户。

Conclusion: 当前网络代理存在多样性和脆弱性，BrowserArena的基准测试方法为大规模评估和理解网络代理故障模式提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent
evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We
introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects
user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses
step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing
step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent
failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation
to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we
discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure
modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies
to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently
misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the
diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking
methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent
failure modes at scale.

### [3] [RefineShot: Rethinking Cinematography Understanding with Foundational Skill Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02423)
*Hang Wu,Yujun Cai,Haonan Ge,Hongkai Chen,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了ShotBench基准测试在电影摄影理解任务中的局限性，包括选项设计模糊和模型推理一致性问题，提出了RefineShot基准来改进评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ShotBench基准存在选项设计模糊、模型推理不一致等问题，影响了电影摄影理解任务的公平评估和未来发展。

Method: 通过一致的选项重构系统性地改进ShotBench，对ShotVL进行首次关键推理行为分析，并引入联合评估任务准确性和核心模型能力的扩展协议。

Result: 开发了RefineShot基准，这是一个经过改进和扩展的基准测试，能够实现更可靠的评估。

Conclusion: RefineShot基准解决了ShotBench的局限性，为电影摄影理解领域的未来发展提供了更可靠的评估基础。

Abstract: Cinematography understanding refers to the ability to recognize not only the
visual content of a scene but also the cinematic techniques that shape
narrative meaning. This capability is attracting increasing attention, as it
enhances multimodal understanding in real-world applications and underpins
coherent content creation in film and media. As the most comprehensive
benchmark for this task, ShotBench spans a wide range of cinematic concepts and
VQA-style evaluations, with ShotVL achieving state-of-the-art results on it.
However, our analysis reveals that ambiguous option design in ShotBench and
ShotVL's shortcomings in reasoning consistency and instruction adherence
undermine evaluation reliability, limiting fair comparison and hindering future
progress. To overcome these issues, we systematically refine ShotBench through
consistent option restructuring, conduct the first critical analysis of
ShotVL's reasoning behavior, and introduce an extended evaluation protocol that
jointly assesses task accuracy and core model competencies. These efforts lead
to RefineShot, a refined and expanded benchmark that enables more reliable
assessment and fosters future advances in cinematography understanding.

### [4] [Safe and Efficient In-Context Learning via Risk Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02480)
*Andrea Wynn,Metod Jazbec,Charith Peris,Rinat Khaziev,Anqi Liu,Daniel Khashabi,Eric Nalisnick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过分布无关风险控制(DFRC)来限制有害上下文示例对LLM性能影响的方法，在保证安全性的同时提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够从少量上下文示例中学习新任务，但这种灵活性带来了安全隐患：模型可能被错误或恶意的示例影响，需要内置机制来防范此类攻击

Method: 定义零样本条件下的基准安全行为，应用DFRC控制上下文样本对性能的影响，通过动态早期退出预测忽略关注不安全输入的后层注意力头，并改进DFRC使其能同时控制有害输入风险和利用有益输入提升性能

Result: 理论和实证结果表明该方法能有效控制有害上下文示例的风险，同时在有益示例上获得显著的计算效率提升

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够平衡LLMs的安全性和效率，为防范上下文示例攻击提供了有效的技术解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to learn new
tasks from a few in-context examples. However, this flexibility introduces
safety concerns: LLMs can be influenced by incorrect or malicious
demonstrations -- for example, if an adversary tampers with or injects harmful
examples without a human supervisor noticing. This motivates principled designs
in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such
attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful
demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline
``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context
demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control
(DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance
below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction,
ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs.
Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk
for harmful inputs \textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on
helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that
our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations
while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with
helpful demonstrations.

### [5] [Multimodal Function Vectors for Spatial Relations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02528)
*Shuhao Fu,Esther Goldberg,Ying Nian Wu,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过因果中介分析识别出OpenFlamingo-4B模型中负责空间关系表征的注意力头，提取并操作这些函数向量可以显著提升LMM在关系任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型多模态模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但其支持任务学习的内在机制仍不透明，需要深入理解模型如何编码和利用空间关系知识。

Method: 使用合成和真实图像数据集，应用因果中介分析识别影响关系预测的注意力头，提取多模态函数向量，并通过少量训练数据微调这些向量（保持LMM参数冻结）。

Result: 提取的函数向量在推理时提升零样本准确率，微调后显著优于上下文学习基线，且关系特定函数向量可以线性组合解决涉及未训练空间关系的类比问题。

Conclusion: LMM在局部内部结构中编码空间关系知识，这些知识可以被系统提取和优化，有助于理解模型模块性并增强对LMM关系推理的控制。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate impressive in-context learning
abilities from limited multimodal demonstrations, yet the internal mechanisms
supporting such task learning remain opaque. Building on prior work of large
language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the
vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting
representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads,
termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's
performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image
datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that
strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function
vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further
demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a
modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to
significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that
relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy
problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the
strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs
encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which
can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our
understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational
reasoning in LMMs.

*Charlie Masters,Advaith Vellanki,Jiangbo Shangguan,Bart Kultys,Jonathan Gilmore,Alastair Moore,Stefano V. Albrecht*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了自主管理代理的概念，用于协调动态人机团队中的复杂多智能体工作流管理，将其形式化为部分可观测随机博弈，并识别了四个核心挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管智能体AI在自动化单个任务方面取得了进展，但管理复杂的多智能体工作流仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，需要开发能够协调人机协作的自主管理系统。

Method: 提出自主管理代理概念，将工作流管理形式化为部分可观测随机博弈，开发了MA-Gym开源仿真框架，并评估了基于GPT-5的管理代理在20个工作流中的表现。

Result: 评估发现GPT-5基础的管理代理在同时优化目标完成、约束遵守和工作流运行时间方面存在困难，凸显了工作流管理作为一个困难开放问题的挑战性。

Conclusion: 工作流管理是一个具有挑战性的开放问题，自主管理系统在组织和伦理方面具有重要影响，需要进一步研究解决已识别的核心挑战。

Abstract: While agentic AI has advanced in automating individual tasks, managing
complex multi-agent workflows remains a challenging problem. This paper
presents a research vision for autonomous agentic systems that orchestrate
collaboration within dynamic human-AI teams. We propose the Autonomous Manager
Agent as a core challenge: an agent that decomposes complex goals into task
graphs, allocates tasks to human and AI workers, monitors progress, adapts to
changing conditions, and maintains transparent stakeholder communication. We
formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and
identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for
hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting
preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance
and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an
open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow
orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we
find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint
adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a
difficult open problem. We conclude with organizational and ethical
implications of autonomous management systems.

support in education, training, and research and establishes a basis for future
applications in other disciplines.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的智能体系统能够自动化和加速增材制造领域的合金发现任务，展示了采用这种多智能体系统的优势。

Abstract: Agentic systems enable the intelligent use of research tooling, augmenting a
researcher's ability to investigate and propose novel solutions to existing
problems. Within Additive Manufacturing (AM), alloy discovery remains a complex
challenge, often requiring expertise in the various domains of materials
science, thermodynamic simulations, and experimental analysis. Large Language
Model (LLM) enabled agents can facilitate this endeavor by utilizing their
extensive knowledge base to dispatch tool calls via Model Context Protocol
(MCP) to perform actions such as Thermo-Calc property diagram calculations and
lack of fusion process map generation. In addition, the multi-agent system
developed in this work is able to effectively reason through complex user
prompts and provide analysis on the printability of proposed alloys. These
agents can dynamically adjust their task trajectory to the outcomes of tool
call results, effectively enabling autonomous decision-making in practical
environments. This work aims to utilize LLM enabled agents to automate and
accelerate the task of alloy discovery within the field of additive
manufacturing and showcase the benefits of adopting this multi-agent system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoMaAS是一个自演化的多智能体架构搜索框架，通过神经架构搜索原理自动发现最优智能体配置，在性能提升1.0-7.1%的同时降低推理成本3-5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化设计方法寻求单一解决方案，无法根据查询复杂度和领域需求自适应分配资源，需要更灵活的多智能体系统设计方法。

Method: 采用动态算子生命周期管理和自动化机器学习技术，包含四个关键创新：自动算子生成、融合和消除；动态成本感知优化；在线反馈集成；增强可解释性的决策追踪机制。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，相比最先进方法，AutoMaAS实现了1.0-7.1%的性能提升，同时降低推理成本3-5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同数据集和LLM骨干网络上展现出卓越的迁移能力，为大语言模型时代的自动化多智能体系统设计建立了新范式。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, yet existing automated design
approaches seek monolithic solutions that fail to adapt resource allocation
based on query complexity and domain requirements. This paper introduces
AutoMaAS, a self-evolving multi-agent architecture search framework that
leverages neural architecture search principles to automatically discover
optimal agent configurations through dynamic operator lifecycle management and
automated machine learning techniques. Our approach incorporates four key
innovations: (1) automatic operator generation, fusion, and elimination based
on performance-cost analysis, (2) dynamic cost-aware optimization with
real-time parameter adjustment, (3) online feedback integration for continuous
architecture refinement, and (4) enhanced interpretability through decision
tracing mechanisms. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate
that AutoMaAS achieves 1.0-7.1\% performance improvement while reducing
inference costs by 3-5\% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework
shows superior transferability across datasets and LLM backbones, establishing
a new paradigm for automated multi-agent system design in the era of large
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个集装箱积载规划(CSPP)的Gym环境，评估了5种强化学习算法在不同复杂度场景下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集装箱积载规划对海运效率至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对不同强化学习算法的系统性基准比较。

Method: 开发了包含起重机调度的CSPP Gym环境，在多智能体和单智能体设置下评估DQN、QR-DQN、A2C、PPO和TRPO五种算法。

Result: 结果显示随着复杂度增加，算法性能差距显著，突显了算法选择和问题表述对CSPP的重要性。

Conclusion: 本文为CSPP提供了多RL方法的基准测试，并提供了一个可重用的Gym环境，为未来海运物流研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Container stowage planning (CSPP) is a critical component of maritime
transportation and terminal operations, directly affecting supply chain
efficiency. Owing to its complexity, CSPP has traditionally relied on human
expertise. While reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to CSPP,
systematic benchmark comparisons across different algorithms remain limited. To
address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental
features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent
and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL
algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying
complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing
complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem
formulation for CSPP. Overall, this paper benchmarks multiple RL methods for
CSPP while providing a reusable Gym environment with crane scheduling, thus
offering a foundation for future research and practical deployment in maritime
logistics.

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态大语言模型的框架，处理传感器数据生成自然语言驾驶警报，提升电动汽车与智能电网交互的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动汽车与智能电网集成面临安全性和可解释性挑战，需要解决驾驶员、车辆与环境之间的安全交互问题。

Method: 使用多模态LLM框架，结合视觉感知(YOLOv8)、地理编码定位和CAN总线遥测数据，通过提示工程生成自然语言警报。

Result: 真实世界数据验证显示，该框架能有效生成针对行人、自行车和其他车辆接近等关键情境的上下文感知警报。

Conclusion: LLM作为电动出行的辅助工具具有巨大潜力，可实现可扩展车队协调、EV负载预测和交通感知能源规划，同时惠及交通系统和电网。

Abstract: The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique
opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks.
However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers,
vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This
paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to
process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic
segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts
for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from
instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to
real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded
positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and
driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban
driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such
as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper
highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting
both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet
coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

### [12] [Mitigating Modal Imbalance in Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02608)
*Chen Henry Wu,Neil Kale,Aditi Raghunathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基础模型在多模态联合推理中的表现，特别是在跨模态冲突场景下。研究发现模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情况下仅能识别3%。问题源于跨模态注意力不平衡，通过显式组合多模态的训练方法可以显著改善这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基础模型在真实世界任务中处理多模态联合推理的能力，特别是当不同模态之间存在交互和关联形成跨模态上下文时。通过跨模态冲突场景来检验模型是优先处理某一模态还是进行联合推理来调和冲突。

Method: 使用跨模态冲突场景进行实验，分析模型在单模态和跨模态情况下的冲突识别能力。通过注意力分析发现跨模态注意力不平衡问题，并提出简单的可扩展方法，即在每个训练实例中显式组合多个模态。

Result: 实验显示：模型在单模态中能识别90%的冲突，但在跨模态情况下仅能识别3%；跨语言场景也有类似发现；跨模态注意力存在极端不对称性；通过显式组合多模态的训练方法能显著减少注意力不平衡，并直接改善多个视觉-语言基准测试的下游性能。

Conclusion: 系统性地解决跨模态上下文对于构建可靠的基础模型至关重要。盲目扩展多模态或多语言数据集无法解决跨模态注意力不平衡问题，需要包含明确要求跨模态推理的训练示例。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) deployed in real-world tasks such as computer-use
agents must integrate diverse modalities. How good are FMs at performing joint
reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when
the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context?
To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts:
scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This
allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason
jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can
recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of
the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across
modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of
multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance,
showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores,
disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal
attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or
multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that
explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and
scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each
training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention
imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several
vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of
systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation
models.

### [13] [On the Role of Temperature Sampling in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02611)
*Yuheng Wu,Azalia Mirhoseini,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时扩展（TTS）在样本数量K增大到一定程度后收益递减，提出温度维度扩展方法，通过多温度采样显著提升LLM推理能力，使基础模型达到接近RL训练模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS方法仅通过增加样本数量来提升推理能力，但存在收益递减问题，且不同温度能解决不同子集的问题，单温度采样无法充分利用模型潜力。

Method: 提出温度维度扩展方法，通过在不同温度下采样多个推理轨迹，并设计多温度投票机制来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个模型和推理基准测试中，温度扩展相比单温度TTS额外提升7.3个百分点，使基础模型性能接近RL训练模型。

Conclusion: TTS的潜力比之前认为的更强大，温度扩展提供了一种简单有效的方法来释放基础模型的潜在能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through
test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the
best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K
steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does
not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain
hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces.
Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different
subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only
part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature
dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3
(0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME
2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an
additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also
enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning
(RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide
a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature
voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our
findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that
temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent
potential of base models.

### [14] [A Concept of Possibility for Real-World Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02655)
*Daniel G. Schwartz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的可能性概念作为Zadeh 1978年标准概念的替代方案，专注于现实世界事件的可能性，通过计算前提条件成立和约束不成立的概率函数来评估事件可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可能性概念存在局限性，需要一种更专注于现实世界事件、适用于规划问题的新可能性理论，以更好地模拟人类对计划的推理。

Method: 采用Łukasiewicz多值逻辑连接词解释，将事件视为具有促成其发生的前提条件和阻碍其发生的约束，通过概率函数计算事件可能性。

Result: 开发了一个新的可能性理论框架，能够评估多个计划中哪个最可能（最容易或最可行）完成，并通过车辆路径规划示例进行了说明。

Conclusion: 该新可能性概念为规划问题提供了有效的评估工具，可能正确模拟了人类对计划的正常推理，并具有未来应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper offers a new concept of {\it possibility} as an alternative to the
now-a-days standard concept originally introduced by L.A. Zadeh in 1978. This
new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common
with it other than that they both adopt the {\L}ukasiewicz multivalent
interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to
provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the
possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites
that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and
the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities
that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of
possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there
are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to
determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to
complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures
normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an
illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a
suggestion of potential future applications.

*Zhaorun Chen,Xun Liu,Mintong Kang,Jiawei Zhang,Minzhou Pan,Shuang Yang,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARMs是一种自适应红队代理，通过推理增强的多步骤编排自动优化多样化红队策略，有效引发目标视觉语言模型的有害输出，在安全评估中达到最先进的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，其多模态接口引入了新的安全漏洞，现有红队方法要么局限于有限的对抗模式，要么依赖人工工程，缺乏对新兴真实世界漏洞的可扩展探索。

Method: 提出11种新颖的多模态攻击策略，涵盖VLM的多样化对抗模式；通过模型上下文协议集成17种红队算法；设计分层记忆和epsilon-greedy攻击探索算法来平衡攻击的多样性和有效性。

Result: 在实例和策略基准测试中，ARMs达到最先进的攻击成功率，平均超过基线52.1%，在Claude-4-Sonnet上超过90%；生成的红队实例多样性显著更高，揭示了VLM的新兴漏洞；构建了包含30K+实例的ARMs-Bench数据集。

Conclusion: 使用ARMs-Bench进行安全微调可显著提高VLM的鲁棒性，同时保持其通用效用，为改进多模态安全对齐提供了可行指导。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces
also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation
challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to
a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering,
lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To
bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that
systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target
harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse
red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to
effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel
multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs
(e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming
algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity
and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an
epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance-
and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates,
exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on
Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated
by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs.
Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety
dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk
categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory
risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness
of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance
to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于约束中心的架构，利用LLM实现生产调度中可靠的自动化约束规范，解决了自然语言歧义和非确定性输出等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要自动化约束规范，但现有方法依赖人工且LLM直接应用存在自然语言歧义、非确定性输出和领域知识有限的问题。

Method: 设计了一个约束中心的分层架构，通过领域特定表示组织三个层次的结构空间，并开发了自动生产场景适配算法。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在约束规范任务中显著优于纯LLM方法，成功平衡了LLM的生成能力和制造系统的可靠性需求。

Conclusion: 提出的约束中心架构能够可靠地自动化生产调度约束规范，为制造系统提供了精确且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for
modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and
production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While
algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively
investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing
requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive.
Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language
Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from
heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges
due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited
domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric
architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint
specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a
hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented
through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability
while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario
adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the
architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative
capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing
systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint
specification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV)框架，通过节点级一致性检查来验证大语言模型的多步推理，提高错误定位精度并减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在验证多步推理时存在错误定位不精确和token成本高的问题，要么评估整个推理链导致注意力分散，要么依赖昂贵的多重采样。

Method: 将推理链分解为相互连接的验证节点，将验证转化为轻量级的二进制一致性检查，避免生成长文本。

Result: 在公共数据集上，NCV相比基线方法F1分数提高10%到25%，同时比传统方法（如基于CoT的验证器）减少6-58倍的token使用量。

Conclusion: NCV框架提供了可扩展的解决方案，提高了可解释性和效率，为可靠的LLM推理验证提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Verifying multi-step reasoning in large language models is difficult due to
imprecise error localization and high token costs. Existing methods either
assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on
expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification
(NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight
binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of
thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors
and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable
solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV
achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing
$6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based
verifiers.

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE框架，用于多维度评估工具增强LLM代理的性能，通过证据库分析推理轨迹，解决了传统答案匹配评估方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强基准主要依赖答案匹配评估，无法评估问题解决轨迹的效率、幻觉和适应性等关键方面，而标注所有有效地面真实轨迹成本过高。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过证据库积累前序推理步骤的知识，实现多维度分析和评估代理的推理轨迹。构建了包含多样化有缺陷轨迹的元评估数据集进行验证。

Result: TRACE能够准确、可扩展且经济高效地评估复杂行为，即使使用小型开源LLM也能实现。应用该方法揭示了代理在工具增强任务中产生轨迹的新观察和见解。

Conclusion: TRACE框架为工具增强LLM代理提供了全面的多维度评估方法，超越了传统答案匹配的限制，能够有效评估推理轨迹的质量。

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests
and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to
answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user
request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond
the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including
previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity.
The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an
agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is
fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is
prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to
assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the
agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the
multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By
incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from
preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and
evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our
framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing
benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with
multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately
evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even
with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the
trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting
previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了机器学习中训练模型能完全满足目标函数的假设（OSA），指出在现实条件下由于近似、估计和优化误差，系统必然偏离预期目标。即使目标函数定义良好，也无法完美捕捉开发者意图，导致目标错误设定不可避免。基于数学分析，这些偏差与Goodhart定律失效模式无法区分，因此需要对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致失控风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战机器学习中训练模型能完全满足目标函数的基本假设（OSA），揭示这一假设在现实条件下的失效及其对AI安全的重要影响。

Method: 采用学习范式无关的分析框架，从近似误差、估计误差和优化误差三个技术层面论证OSA的失效，并结合数学结果分析这些偏差与Goodhart定律失效模式的不可区分性。

Result: 证明在现实条件下，训练模型必然系统性地偏离预期目标函数，且这种偏差无法与Goodhart定律失效模式区分，存在失控风险。

Conclusion: 由于无法预先确定Goodhart失效点，必须对通用AI系统的优化设定原则性限制，否则持续优化将导致可预测且不可逆的失控。

Abstract: A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training
yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call
this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA
are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a
learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions:
approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic
deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its
specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and
translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences,
into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification
inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical
characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that
collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure.
Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled
limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent
such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable
and irreversible loss of control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BayesianRouter框架，结合离线RM强度学习和在线贝叶斯选择，解决现有RM路由方法的冷启动和探索不足问题，在多个基准测试中优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLHF/RLAIF流程依赖单一奖励模型，限制了对齐质量并存在过拟合风险。现有RM路由方法存在冷启动和探索不足的问题。

Method: 采用混合路由框架：离线阶段训练多任务路由器估计每个RM的可靠性；在线阶段使用贝叶斯Thompson采样路由器进行逐查询RM选择，用离线嵌入作为高斯先验初始化权重向量，并通过在线奖励自适应更新后验分布。

Result: 在指令跟随（AlpacaEval-2、Arena-Hard、MT-Bench）和推理（GSM8K、MMLU）基准测试中，BayesianRouter始终优于单个RM、RM集成和现有路由方法。

Conclusion: BayesianRouter通过结合离线学习和在线贝叶斯选择，有效解决了RM路由中的冷启动和探索不足问题，显著提升了语言模型对齐性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF / RLAIF) has become
the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, most
pipelines rely on a single reward model (RM), limiting alignment quality and
risking overfitting. Recent work explores RM routing--dynamically selecting an
RM from a candidate pool to exploit complementary strengths while maintaining
$O(1)$ RM calls--but existing methods suffer from cold-start and insufficient
exploration. We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that
combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the
offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate
per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router
performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with
offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors
with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive
experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and
reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently
outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型的非自回归特性使得重要性采样难以处理，传统强化学习方法如GRPO在DDM中应用困难，需要新的优化方法。

Method: 首先建立DDM的理论基础，构建能捕捉有价值token波动的重要性估计器；然后为视觉序列精心设计rollout方法，产生多样化的补全和可靠的优化梯度。

Result: 在数学推理、编程和视觉生成基准测试中，MaskGRPO带来了更稳定高效的更新，实现了更强的推理性能和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: MaskGRPO建立了一个系统的策略优化方法，是离散化视觉扩散的第一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing discrete diffusion model (DDM) with rewards remains a challenge:
the non-autoregressive paradigm makes importance sampling intractable and
rollout complex, puzzling reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this study, we introduce MaskGRPO, the first
viable approach to enable scalable multimodal reinforcement learning in
discrete diffusion with effective importance sampling and modality-specific
adaptations. To this end, we first clarify the theoretical foundation for DDMs,
which facilitates building an importance estimator that captures valuable token
fluctuation for gradient updates. We then delicately tailored the rollout
method for visual sequences, which yields diverse completions and reliable
optimization gradients. Upon math reasoning, coding, and visual generation
benchmarks, MaskGRPO brings more stable and efficient updates, leading to
stronger reasoning performance and better generation quality. This study
establishes MaskGRPO as a systematic policy optimization approach and the first
practical way for discretized visual diffusion.

Result: 分析表明，XAI方法中看似微小的技术变化可能对应着关于解释基础假设的重要差异。忽视底层本体-认识论范式在选择XAI方法时存在风险。

Conclusion: 在选择XAI方法时需要考虑其底层本体论和认识论假设，并为不同应用领域选择和适配适当的方法，以确保解释的有效性和适用性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in almost every field. At the
same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally
black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly
limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim
to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision
process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and
scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their
assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different
conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an
explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or
relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical
debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into
different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the
validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We
investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability
methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make
about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about
those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to
an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying
assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring
the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a
given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI
methods for different domains of application.

Conclusion: 为智能环境提供了一种新的解释框架，并提供了经验证据来指导何时选择哪种解释类型最有效。

Abstract: Explainability is increasingly seen as an essential feature of rule-based
smart environments. While counterfactual explanations, which describe what
could have been done differently to achieve a desired outcome, are a powerful
tool in eXplainable AI (XAI), no established methods exist for generating them
in these rule-based domains. In this paper, we present the first formalization
and implementation of counterfactual explanations tailored to this domain. It
is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for
smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated
counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations. The results show that
user preference is highly contextual: causal explanations are favored for their
linguistic simplicity and in time-pressured situations, while counterfactuals
are preferred for their actionable content, particularly when a user wants to
resolve a problem. Our work contributes a practical framework for a new type of
explanation in smart environments and provides empirical evidence to guide the
choice of when each explanation type is most effective.

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了深度学习模型推理机制的新见解，强调需要超越模式识别、实现稳健抽象推理的架构设计。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning lies at the core of human cognition and remains a
fundamental challenge for artificial intelligence. Raven's Progressive Matrices
(RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by
requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based
and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains
unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or
reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization
capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by
deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both
sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as
CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN
(I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate
strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when
faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level
accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in
current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning
mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for
architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract
reasoning.

Abstract: Deep research has revolutionized data analysis, yet data scientists still
devote substantial time to manually crafting visualizations, highlighting the
need for robust automation from natural language queries. However, current
systems struggle with complex datasets containing multiple files and iterative
refinement. Existing approaches, including simple single- or multi-agent
systems, often oversimplify the task, focusing on initial query parsing while
failing to robustly manage data complexity, code errors, or final visualization
quality. In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative
multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs
specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation,
and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how
metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement
ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains
in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%. This
work demonstrates that the future of visualization automation lies not in
isolated code generation but in integrated, collaborative agentic workflows.

Motivation: 连续扩散模型在理论上比离散扩散模型和循环变换器具有更强的表达能力，但在实际语言建模任务中表现不如离散模型。作者认为这种矛盾源于连续模型在将连续表示解码回离散标记空间时的困难。

Method: 提出了CCDD模型，在连续表示空间和离散标记空间的联合空间上定义多模态扩散过程，使用单一模型同时在联合空间中进行去噪。结合了连续空间的丰富语义和离散标记的良好可训练性。

Conclusion: CCDD通过联合连续-离散扩散过程，成功平衡了表达能力和训练性能，为扩散语言模型提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have
achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary
empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped
transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models
typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue
that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete
space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger
expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the
contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance
to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides
intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce
additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the
continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous
Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process
on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,
leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By
combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent
space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of
explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced
training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical
performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

Motivation: 在多径信道环境中，传统的TDoA定位算法性能会显著下降，需要开发更有效的算法来提升无人机控制器的定位精度。

Method: 提出了两种算法：最大似然(ML)算法和最小二乘班克罗夫特-高斯牛顿(LS-BF-GN)算法，并采用多次位置估计平均的方法来进一步提高精度。

Result: 仿真结果表明，ML和LS-BF-GN算法在多径信道中显著优于LS-BF算法，能够有效提升定位精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效应对多径信道对TDoA定位的影响，同时还需要考虑传感器间时间同步误差对定位性能的影响。

Abstract: We study time difference of arrival (TDoA)-based algorithms for drone
controller localization and analyze TDoA estimation in multipath channels.
Building on TDoA estimation, we propose two algorithms to enhance localization
accuracy in multipath environments: the Maximum Likelihood (ML) algorithm and
the Least Squares Bancroft with Gauss-Newton (LS-BF-GN) algorithm. We evaluate
these proposed algorithms in two typical outdoor channels: Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) Channel F and the two-ray ground reflection (TRGR) channel. Our
simulation results demonstrate that the ML and LS-BF-GN algorithms
significantly outperform the LS-BF algorithm in multipath channels. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we propose averaging multiple tentative location
estimations. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of time synchronization
errors among sensors on localization performance through simulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an anti-jamming communication framework for
orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under jamming
attacks. To this end, we first develop an anti-jamming modulation scheme that
uses a spreading matrix to distribute each symbol across multiple subcarriers,
enhancing robustness against jamming. For optimal demodulation at a receiver,
we devise a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) method and its low-complexity
variant tailored to our anti-jamming modulation scheme in scenarios with known
jamming variance. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of our modulation scheme
to optimize its modulation order according to a jamming scenario. To adapt to
dynamic and unknown jamming environments, we present a jamming-adaptive
communication framework consisting of two phases: (i) a jamming-noncoherent
phase and (ii) a jamming-coherent phase. In the jamming-noncoherent phase, we
develop an approximate MLD method that operates without prior knowledge of
jamming variance and enables the estimation of jamming parameters. In the
jamming-coherent phase, we use these estimated parameters to optimize the
proposed modulation scheme while employing the low-complexity MLD method.
Simulation results demonstrate the superior BER performance of the proposed
anti-jamming framework compared to existing OFDM communication frameworks
across a wide range of communication and jamming scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了因果涌现理论，分析了系统多尺度结构中的因果贡献分布，提出了因果涌现层次的概念，并开发了量化这种复杂性的数学工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统具有多尺度结构，但现有理论主要分析单一尺度路径，需要更全面地理解多尺度结构如何形成以及因果贡献在不同尺度上的分布。

Method: 扩展因果涌现理论(2.0)，分析系统完整多尺度结构而非单一尺度路径的因果贡献，开发量化工具来分类系统的因果涌现层次结构。

Result: 系统可分为因果上重、下重或复杂层次结构，提供了比标准网络科学更具体的尺度无关性概念，展示了在系统多尺度结构中工程化涌现分布的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了量化系统多尺度复杂性的数学工具，揭示了因果涌现层次结构的分类学，能够精确控制涌现现象在多尺度结构中的分布。

Abstract: One of the reasons complex systems are complex is because they have
multiscale structure. How does this multiscale structure come about? We argue
that it reflects an emergent hierarchy of scales that contribute to the
system's causal workings. An example is how a computer can be described at the
level of its hardware circuitry but also its software. But we show that many
systems, even simple ones, have such an emergent hierarchy, built from a small
subset of all their possible scales of description. Formally, we extend the
theory of causal emergence (2.0) so as to analyze the causal contributions
across the full multiscale structure of a system rather than just over a single
path that traverses the system's scales. Our methods reveal that systems can be
classified as being causally top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or their emergent
hierarchies can be highly complex. We argue that this provides a more specific
notion of scale-freeness (here, when causation is spread equally across the
scales of a system) than the standard network science terminology. More
broadly, we provide the mathematical tools to quantify this complexity and
provide diverse examples of the taxonomy of emergent hierarchies. Finally, we
demonstrate the ability to engineer not just degree of emergence in a system,
but how that emergence is distributed across the multiscale structure.

Motivation: 在具有不完美信道状态信息的无线网络中，为联邦学习设计高效的下行广播方案以减少传输延迟。

Method: 提出SegAB方案，将全局模型参数向量分段，在公共下行信道上同时传输多个参数；建立传输和接收过程的数学模型，通过epigraph表示和可行性子问题实现鲁棒波束成形。

Result: 仿真显示SegAB在标准分类任务中显著优于传统的全模型逐参数广播和其他替代方案。

Conclusion: SegAB方案能有效提高联邦学习在无线网络中的训练收敛速率，特别适用于不完美信道状态信息场景。

Abstract: We consider downlink broadcast design for federated learning (FL) in a
wireless network with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Aiming to
reduce transmission latency, we propose a segmented analog broadcast (SegAB)
scheme, where the parameter server, hosted by a multi-antenna base station,
partitions the global model parameter vector into segments and transmits
multiple parameters from these segments simultaneously over a common downlink
channel. We formulate the SegAB transmission and reception processes to
characterize FL training convergence, capturing the effects of downlink
beamforming and imperfect CSI. To maximize the FL training convergence rate, we
establish an upper bound on the expected model optimality gap and show that it
can be minimized separately over the training rounds in online optimization,
without requiring knowledge of the future channel states. We solve the
per-round problem to achieve robust downlink beamforming, by minimizing the
worst-case objective via an epigraph representation and a feasibility
subproblem that ensures monotone convergence. Simulation with standard
classification tasks under typical wireless network setting shows that the
proposed SegAB substantially outperforms conventional full-model per-parameter
broadcast and other alternatives.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于环境反向散射通信的符号定时偏移估计方法，通过设计专用导频序列和最大似然估计框架，在不依赖环境射频源协调的情况下实现准确同步和符号检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有环境反向散射通信研究假设理想同步，但实际中由于传播延迟和接收器激活延迟会产生符号定时偏移，导致符号恢复不可靠，且传统基于相关的同步方法因环境射频源不可控而不可行。

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ambient Internet of Things
(AIoT) devices to achieve ultra-low-power, low-cost, and massive connectivity.
Most existing AmBC studies assume ideal synchronization between the backscatter
device (BD) and the backscatter receiver (BR). However, in practice, symbol
timing offset (STO) occurs due to both the propagation delay and the BR
activation latency, which leads to unreliable symbol recovery at the BR.
Moreover, the uncontrollable nature of the ambient radio frequency source
renders conventional correlation-based synchronization methods infeasible in
AmBC. To address this challenge, we investigate STO estimation and symbol
detection in AmBC without requiring coordination from the ambient radio
frequency source. Firstly, we design a specialized pilot sequence at the BD to
induce sampling errors in the pilot signal. Furthermore, we propose a
pilot-based STO estimator using the framework of maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE), which can exploit the statistical variations in the received pilot
signal. Finally, we integrate STO compensation into an energy detector and
evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that the
proposed estimator achieves accurate STO estimation and effectively mitigates
the BER performance degradation caused by STO.

Conclusion: 事件视觉传感器为相位恢复提供了一种时间高效且稳定的解决方案，特别适用于低光照条件，通过离焦事件与相位的线性关系实现准确相位分布恢复。

Abstract: To time-efficiently and stably acquire the intensity information for phase
retrieval under a coherent illumination, we leverage an event-based vision
sensor (EVS) that can detect changes in logarithmic intensity at the pixel
level with a wide dynamic range. In our optical system, we translate the EVS
along the optical axis, where the EVS records the intensity changes induced by
defocus as events. To recover phase distributions, we formulate a partial
differential equation, referred to as the transport of event equation, which
presents a linear relationship between the defocus events and the phase
distribution. We demonstrate through experiments that the EVS is more
advantageous than the conventional image sensor for rapidly and stably
detecting the intensity information, defocus events, which enables accurate
phase retrieval, particularly under low-lighting conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: von Neumann的开创性工作表明纠错码可以克服电路组件故障，但选择适合计算的编码很困难，需要在码率、距离和计算可访问性之间取得平衡。

Method: 通过理论分析证明编码家族无法同时具备恒定码率、增长距离和短深度CNOT门实现，揭示了这些参数之间的基本权衡关系。

Result: 证明了在容错计算中，要实现良好的码率和距离，就必须接受非常深的电路，这是一个在某些架构和应用中不理想的权衡。

Conclusion: 编码设计在容错计算中存在基本限制，码率、距离和计算可访问性之间存在不可避免的权衡，这为未来编码设计提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata
Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty
circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code
is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of
the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the
fault-tolerant circuit, while increasing the distance of the code ensures
robustness against faults. If the rate and distance were the only concerns, we
could use asymptotically optimal codes as is done in communication settings.
However, choosing a code for computation is challenging due to an additional
requirement: The code needs to facilitate accessibility of encoded information
to enable computation on encoded data. This seems to conflict with having large
rate and distance. We prove that this is indeed the case, namely that a code
family cannot simultaneously have constant rate, growing distance and
short-depth gadgets to perform encoded CNOT gates. As a consequence, achieving
good rate and distance may necessarily entail accepting very deep circuits, an
undesirable trade-off in certain architectures and applications.

Motivation: 代码稀疏化是图论中割稀疏化概念在编码理论中的类比。最近的研究表明线性码存在尺寸为n/2+O(√kn)的单边1/2稀疏化器，但寻找最小尺寸稀疏化器的计算复杂度未知。

Method: 通过从经典的最近码字问题归约，证明寻找最小单边1/2稀疏化器是NP难的。

Result: 证明了寻找最小尺寸的单边1/2稀疏化器是NP难问题，并给出了近似难度结果。

Conclusion: 代码稀疏化的最小化问题在计算上是困难的，这为编码理论中的稀疏化研究提供了计算复杂性的理论边界。

Abstract: The notion of code sparsification was introduced by Khanna, Putterman and
Sudan (arxiv.2311.00788), as an analogue to the the more established notion of
cut sparsification in graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, for $\alpha\in
(0,1)$ an (unweighted) one-sided $\alpha$-sparsifier for a linear code
$\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a subset $S\subseteq [n]$ such that
the weight of each codeword projected onto the coordinates in $S$ is preserved
up to an $\alpha$ fraction. Recently, Gharan and Sahami (arxiv.2502.02799) show
the existence of one-sided 1/2-sparsifiers of size $n/2+O(\sqrt{kn})$ for any
linear code, where $k$ is the dimension of $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we
consider the computational problem of finding a one-sided 1/2-sparsifier of
minimal size, and show that it is NP-hard, via a reduction from the classical
nearest codeword problem. We also show hardness of approximation results.

Motivation: 研究在感知约束下，智能体由于不准确的先验信念或他人模型而产生的注意力盲区现象，即智能体未意识到自身信念错误的情况

Method: 在双玩家零和随机博弈中建模感知约束为在线传感器选择问题，开发基于理性疏忽的价值加权目标函数，提出贪婪算法进行传感器选择，并为玩家2设计近视决策算法来利用玩家1的信念偏差

Result: 当玩家2不偏离预设策略时，该目标函数为玩家1相比完美信息状态下的安全价值期望损失提供了上界；玩家2通过偏离预设策略可以系统性地利用玩家1的注意力盲区获得优势

Conclusion: 数值示例显示玩家1持续选择与其先验一致的传感器，使得玩家2能够系统性地利用其注意力疏忽，揭示了感知约束下理性疏忽决策的脆弱性

Abstract: We study decision-making with rational inattention in settings where agents
have perception constraints. In such settings, inaccurate prior beliefs or
models of others may lead to inattention blindness, where an agent is unaware
of its incorrect beliefs. We model this phenomenon in two-player zero-sum
stochastic games, where Player 1 has perception constraints and Player 2
deceptively deviates from its security policy presumed by Player 1 to gain an
advantage. We formulate the perception constraints as an online sensor
selection problem, develop a value-weighted objective function for sensor
selection capturing rational inattention, and propose the greedy algorithm for
selection under this monotone objective function. When Player 2 does not
deviate from the presumed policy, this objective function provides an upper
bound on the expected value loss compared to the security value where Player 1
has perfect information of the state. We then propose a myopic decision-making
algorithm for Player 2 to exploit Player 1's beliefs by deviating from the
presumed policy and, thereby, improve upon the security value. Numerical
examples illustrate how Player 1 persistently chooses sensors that are
consistent with its priors, allowing Player 2 to systematically exploit its
inattention.

Result: 证明了该问题可以在多项式空间内解决，并提供了匹配的复杂度下界

Conclusion: 具有可达性目标的重复人口博弈是PSPACE完全问题

Abstract: In repeated games, players choose actions concurrently at each step. We
consider a parameterized setting of repeated games in which the players form a
population of an arbitrary size. Their utility functions encode a reachability
objective. The problem is whether there exists a uniform coalition strategy for
the players so that they are sure to win independently of the population size.
We use algebraic tools to show that the problem can be solved in polynomial
space. First we exhibit a finite semigroup whose elements summarize strategies
over a finite interval of population sizes. Then, we characterize the existence
of winning strategies by the existence of particular elements in this
semigroup. Finally, we provide a matching complexity lower bound, to conclude
that repeated population games with reachability objectives are
PSPACE-complete.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从训练集中检索查询变体(QVs)的方法，通过两跳检索机制提高查询性能预测(QPP)效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于查询变体的QPP方法使用查询扩展或非上下文嵌入生成QVs，可能引入主题漂移和幻觉问题

Method: 从训练集(如MS MARCO)检索QVs，通过直接检索(1跳QVs)和基于相关文档的二次检索(2跳QVs)两阶段检索机制

Result: 在TREC DL'19和DL'20上的实验表明，该方法比现有最佳生成式QV的QPP方法性能提升约20%

Conclusion: 从训练集检索QVs的方法能更有效地捕捉相似信息需求，显著提升QPP性能

Abstract: Leveraging query variants (QVs), i.e., queries with potentially similar
information needs to the target query, has been shown to improve the
effectiveness of query performance prediction (QPP) approaches. Existing
QV-based QPP methods generate QVs facilitated by either query expansion or
non-contextual embeddings, which may introduce topical drifts and
hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a method that retrieves QVs from a
training set (e.g., MS MARCO) for a given target query of QPP. To achieve a
high recall in retrieving queries with the most similar information needs as
the target query from a training set, we extend the directly retrieved QVs
(1-hop QVs) by a second retrieval using their denoted relevant documents (which
yields 2-hop QVs). Our experiments, conducted on TREC DL'19 and DL'20, show
that the QPP methods with QVs retrieved by our method outperform the
best-performing existing generated-QV-based QPP approaches by as much as around
20\%, on neural ranking models like MonoT5.

Motivation: 现有密集检索系统难以处理表达宽泛或间接用户意图的挑战性查询，而现有的查询重构方法要么只关注广度（扩展查询子主题范围），要么只关注深度（阐述查询潜在含义），无法同时兼顾两者。

Method: 提出EQR方法，基于大语言模型生成具有信息丰富阐述的潜在查询子主题，结合了广度（子主题生成）和深度（详细阐述）两个维度。

Result: 实验表明EQR在各种评估指标上显著优于最先进的查询重构方法，在旅行、酒店和餐厅三个新建立的基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 简单而有效的查询重构方法可以显著改进自然语言推荐系统对宽泛和间接用户意图查询的处理能力。

Abstract: Natural Language (NL) recommender systems aim to retrieve relevant items from
free-form user queries and item descriptions. Existing systems often rely on
dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that
express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g.,
"cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query
reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR
methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth)
or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In
this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large
language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by
generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We
also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel,
hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with
challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a
simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender
systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.

Motivation: 解决通用压缩器资源消耗大、吞吐量低的问题，以及专用压缩器适用范围有限、部署维护困难的问题。

Method: 提出图模型压缩理论框架，将压缩表示为模块化编解码器的有向无环图，实现OpenZL系统，支持自描述格式和通用解码器。

Result: 在真实数据集上实现优于最先进通用压缩器的压缩比和速度，Meta内部部署显示大小和/或速度持续改进。

Conclusion: OpenZL代表了现代数据密集型应用中实用、可扩展和可维护数据压缩的进步。

Abstract: Research in general-purpose lossless compression over the last decade has
largely found improvements in compression ratio that come at great cost to
resource utilization and processing throughput. However, most production
workloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most
research systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in
compression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific
compressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of
the data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best
generic compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not
without drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are
difficult to maintain and deploy.
  We show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking
about compression. We propose the ``graph model'' of compression, a new
theoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph
of modular codecs. This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that
compresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which
can be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid
development of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder
eliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard
component library minimizes security risks. Experimental results demonstrate
that OpenZL achieves superior compression ratios and speeds compared to
state-of-the-art general-purpose compressors on a variety of real-world
datasets. Internal deployments at Meta have also shown consistent improvements
in size and/or speed, with development timelines reduced from months to days.
OpenZL thus represents an advance in practical, scalable, and maintainable data
compression for modern data-intensive applications.

Motivation: 虽然扩大生成器规模可以提高准确性，但会增加成本并限制部署能力，因此探索通过扩大检索器语料库来减少对大语言模型依赖的替代方案。

Method: 研究检索增强生成(RAG)中语料库扩展的效果，通过实验分析不同规模语料库与不同规模语言模型的组合表现。

Result: 语料库扩展持续增强RAG性能，可以作为增加模型规模的替代方案；中等规模生成器配合大语料库通常能与更大模型配合小语料库相媲美；改进主要来自答案相关段落覆盖率的增加。

Conclusion: 投资更大的语料库是增强RAG的有效途径，通常可与扩大语言模型本身相媲美，建立了语料库-生成器的权衡原则。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large
language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also
raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging
the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results
show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a
substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger
scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival
much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the
most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that
improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing
passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These
findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger
corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging
the LLM itself.

### [43] [Even Faster Kernel Matrix Linear Algebra via Density Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02540)
*Rikhav Shah,Sandeep Silwal,Haike Xu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文改进了基于核密度估计（KDE）的核矩阵线性代数任务算法，包括矩阵-向量乘积、矩阵-矩阵乘积、谱范数和矩阵元素和的计算，显著降低了时间复杂度对误差ε和点数n的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在计算核矩阵相关任务时对误差ε和点数n的依赖较高，特别是当通过KDE查询而非读取单个元素访问核矩阵时，需要更高效的计算方法。

Method: 使用核密度估计（KDE）方法改进核矩阵的线性代数运算，通过优化算法设计来降低对ε的多项式依赖和对n的依赖。

Result: 相比现有最佳算法（特别是Backurs等人2021年的工作），新算法显著减少了ε的多项式依赖，并在计算核矩阵元素和时进一步降低了对n的依赖。

Conclusion: 提出的KDE方法在核矩阵计算任务中取得了显著改进，同时通过下界分析揭示了基于KDE方法在这些问题中的局限性。

Abstract: This paper studies the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) for linear
algebraic tasks involving the kernel matrix of a collection of $n$ data points
in $\mathbb R^d$. In particular, we improve upon existing algorithms for
computing the following up to $(1+\varepsilon)$ relative error: matrix-vector
products, matrix-matrix products, the spectral norm, and sum of all entries.
The runtimes of our algorithms depend on the dimension $d$, the number of
points $n$, and the target error $\varepsilon$. Importantly, the dependence on
$n$ in each case is far lower when accessing the kernel matrix through KDE
queries as opposed to reading individual entries.
  Our improvements over existing best algorithms (particularly those of
Backurs, Indyk, Musco, and Wagner '21) for these tasks reduce the polynomial
dependence on $\varepsilon$, and additionally decreases the dependence on $n$
in the case of computing the sum of all entries of the kernel matrix.
  We complement our upper bounds with several lower bounds for related
problems, which provide (conditional) quadratic time hardness results and
additionally hint at the limits of KDE based approaches for the problems we
study.

### [44] [Near-Optimal Fault-Tolerant Strong Connectivity Preservers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02562)
*Gary Hoppenworth,Thatchaphol Saranurak,Benyu Wang*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文针对有向图的k容错连通性保持器问题，将现有边界从O(k2^k n^{2-1/k})改进到O(k4^k n log n)，几乎填补了与无向图最优边界Θ(kn)之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有向图的k容错连通性保持器问题存在显著的理论差距，现有上界与下界相差Ω(n^{1-1/k})，而无向图的最优边界Θ(kn)早在90年代就已确立。

Method: 作者提出了新的构造方法，能够构建具有O(k4^k n log n)边的k容错连通性保持器，并在多项式时间内构建具有O(8^k n log^{5/2} n)边的保持器。

Result: 将有向图k容错连通性保持器的边界改进到O(k4^k n log n)，同时将k连通性保持器的边界从O(k2^k n^{2-1/(k-1)})改进到O(k4^k n log n)。

Conclusion: 对于常数k，该结果在log n因子内是最优的，并且证明了k连通性保持器对k的指数依赖不是固有的，提出了另一个具有O(n√(kn))边的构造。

Abstract: A $k$-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver of a directed $n$-vertex graph
$G$ is a subgraph $H$ such that, for any edge set $F \subseteq E(G)$ of size
$|F| \le k$, the strongly connected components of $G - F$ and $H - F$ are the
same. While some graphs require a preserver with $\Omega(2^{k}n)$ edges
[BCR18], the best-known upper bound is $\tilde{O}(k2^{k}n^{2-1/k})$ edges
[CC20], leaving a significant gap of $\Omega(n^{1-1/k})$. In contrast, there is
no gap in undirected graphs; the optimal bound of $\Theta(kn)$ has been
well-established since the 90s [NI92].
  We nearly close the gap for directed graphs; we prove that there exists a
$k$-fault-tolerant connectivity preserver with $O(k4^{k}n\log n)$ edges, and we
can construct one with $O(8^{k}n\log^{5/2}n)$ edges in $\text{poly}(2^{k}n)$
time.
  Our results also improve the state-of-the-art for a closely related object; a
\textit{$k$-connectivity preserver} of $G$ is a subgraph $H$ where, for all $i
\le k$, the strongly $i$-connected components of $G$ and $H$ agree. By a known
reduction, we obtain a $k$-connectivity preserver with $O(k4^{k}n\log n)$
edges, improving the previous best bound of $\tilde{O}(k2^{k}n^{2-1/(k-1)})$
[CC20]. Therefore, for any constant $k$, our results are optimal to a $\log n$
factor for both problems.
  Lastly, we show that the exponential dependency on $k$ is not inherent for
$k$-connectivity preservers by presenting another construction with $O(n
\sqrt{kn})$ edges.

*Sayan Mukherjee,Shinichiro Akiyama*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文研究了将任意图的顶点嵌入到树结构中的问题，通过拉普拉斯特征值建立了嵌入拥塞的上下界，并提出了一种基于谱聚类的启发式算法来寻找低拥塞嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图顶点嵌入树结构是计算机科学和物理学中的重要问题，特别是在张量网络收缩中具有应用价值。研究旨在最小化嵌入过程中的拥塞度量。

Method: 使用拉普拉斯特征值分析建立拥塞的上下界，并提出基于层次谱聚类的收缩启发式算法来寻找低拥塞嵌入。

Result: 证明了拥塞与拉普拉斯特征值的关系：λ₂(G)·2n/9 ≤ cng(G) ≤ λₙ(G)·2n/9，并在超立方体、格点、随机图和量子电路张量网络上进行了数值验证。

Conclusion: 该工作为图嵌入树结构的拥塞问题提供了理论界限和实用算法，并对张量网络收缩的内存复杂度给出了新的上下界。

Abstract: Embedding the vertices of arbitrary graphs into trees while minimizing some
measure of overlap is an important problem with applications in computer
science and physics. In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively
embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an
$n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding
is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained
by deleting any vertex of $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is
defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that
$\lambda_2(G)\cdot 2n/9\le \mathrm{cng} (G)\le \lambda_n(G)\cdot 2n/9$, where
$0=\lambda_1(G)\le \cdots \le \lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of
$G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral
clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in
finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our
congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure
(hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of
quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory
complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph.

### [46] [On the Enumeration of all Unique Paths of Recombining Trinomial Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02727)
*Ethan Torres,Ramavarapu Sreenivas,Richard Sowers*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于重组三叉树的高效枚举算法，通过利用平移不变性和路径与弱组合之间的双射关系，将搜索空间指数级缩减，实现更深层次树的处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重组三叉树在期权定价、物流和反馈控制中广泛应用，但深度为D的树会产生O(3^D)条轨迹，使得穷举枚举不可行。需要开发高效算法来处理更深的树以获得更精确的数值近似。

Method: 利用时间齐次动力学下的两种对称性：(i)节点的平移不变性；(ii)容许路径与编码弱组合的有序元组之间的规范双射。引入质量转移枚举算法，通过滑动整数"质量"通过基数元组来生成每个路径等价类的唯一代表，同时隐式计数相关的弱组合。

Result: 算法将搜索空间指数级缩减，能够处理更深的树。推导出组合计数表达式的上界，得出算法成本的理论下界约为O(D^{1/2}1.612^D)。实证测试证实了该界限，显示相对于经典广度优先遍历有显著加速。

Conclusion: 提出的算法框架与Motzkin路径和Narayana型细化存在结构联系，为路径依赖泛函提供了新的分析工具和精化的枚举公式。

Abstract: Recombining trinomial trees are a workhorse for modeling discrete-event
systems in option pricing, logistics, and feedback control. Because each node
stores a state-dependent quantity, a depth-$D$ tree naively yields
$\mathcal{O}(3^{D})$ trajectories, making exhaustive enumeration infeasible.
Under time-homogeneous dynamics, however, the graph exhibits two exploitable
symmetries: (i) translational invariance of nodes and (ii) a canonical
bijection between admissible paths and ordered tuples encoding weak
compositions. Leveraging these, we introduce a mass-shifting enumeration
algorithm that slides integer "masses" through a cardinality tuple to generate
exactly one representative per path-equivalence class while implicitly counting
the associated weak compositions. This trims the search space by an exponential
factor, enabling markedly deeper trees -- and therefore tighter numerical
approximations of the underlying evolution -- to be processed in practice. We
further derive an upper bound on the combinatorial counting expression that
induces a theoretical lower bound on the algorithmic cost of approximately
$\mathcal{O}\bigl(D^{1/2}1.612^{D}\bigr)$. This correspondence permits direct
benchmarking while empirical tests, whose pseudo-code we provide, corroborate
the bound, showing only a small constant overhead and substantial speedups over
classical breadth-first traversal. Finally, we highlight structural links
between our algorithmic/combinatorial framework and Motzkin paths with
Narayana-type refinements, suggesting refined enumerative formulas and new
potential analytic tools for path-dependent functionals.

### [47] [Pareto-optimal Non-uniform Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02795)
*Moses Charikar,Chirag Pabbaraju*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了极限语言生成中的帕累托最优性，提出了一个算法，其生成时间几乎达到帕累托最优，即在任何其他算法中，如果某个语言的生成时间更短，必然导致其他语言的生成时间更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究虽然实现了非均匀语言生成保证，但生成时间可能严格次优。本文旨在研究如何在极限语言生成中实现帕累托最优性，即找到最优的生成时间权衡。

Method: 提出了一个算法框架，该框架能够实现几乎帕累托最优的非均匀语言生成时间。该框架还能适应噪声生成和代表性生成等实际场景。

Result: 开发出的算法在生成时间上达到几乎帕累托最优，这是非均匀生成中能达到的最佳结果。算法框架还能扩展到噪声和代表性生成场景。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在极限语言生成中实现帕累托最优非均匀生成的可能性，并提供了适用于多种实际场景的算法框架，为非均匀语言生成提供了最优解决方案。

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for
language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages,
and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the
collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language,
such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman
and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform
generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid
strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that
depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order.
However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the
algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation
in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are
(almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some
language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its
generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than
$t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve
for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to
further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the
practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.

*J Niklas Dahlmeier,D Ellis Hershkowitz*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 研究在弧插入过程中如何维护最大基数树状图森林，同时最小化调整次数（recourse）——即维护解中改变的弧的总数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该问题是最大基数匹配的"树状图版本"，旨在探索在动态图环境中维护最优结构时所需的最小调整成本。

Method: 在不可能性方面，观察到即使在仅插入模型中，m条弧的对抗性到达可能需要Ω(m·n)次调整；在可能性方面，提出了一个算法，当所有m条弧均匀随机到达时，期望调整次数为O(m·log²n)。

Result: 证明了对抗性场景下调整次数的下界为Ω(m·n)，与平凡上界O(m·n)匹配；在随机场景下，算法实现了期望调整次数O(m·log²n)。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了在动态维护最大基数树状图森林问题时，调整成本在对抗性和随机性场景下的显著差异，为动态图算法设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: In this work, we study how to maintain a forest of arborescences of maximum
arc cardinality under arc insertions while minimizing recourse -- the total
number of arcs changed in the maintained solution. This problem is the
"arborescence version'' of max cardinality matching.
  On the impossibility side, we observe that even in this insertion-only model,
it is possible for $m$ adversarial arc arrivals to necessarily incur $\Omega(m
\cdot n)$ recourse, matching a trivial upper bound of $O(m \cdot n)$. On the
possibility side, we give an algorithm with expected recourse $O(m \cdot \log^2
n)$ if all $m$ arcs arrive uniformly at random.

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出了基于交替采样框架的MCMC算法，用于在凸体K上均匀采样，通过拒绝采样高效实现受限高斯预言机(RGO)，支持投影预言机或分离预言机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在凸体上均匀采样的计算效率问题，传统方法在高维空间中效率低下，需要开发更高效的采样算法。

Method: 使用交替采样框架/邻近采样器，通过吉布斯采样在增强分布上实现，利用拒绝采样和投影/分离预言机来高效实现RGO。

Result: 建立了在Rényi散度或χ²散度度量下的非渐近复杂度分析，能够获得无偏样本。

Conclusion: 提出的算法为凸体均匀采样提供了高效的实现方案，在两种预言机模型下都具有理论保证的复杂度。

Abstract: We propose new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample a uniform
distribution on a convex body $K$. Our algorithms are based on the Alternating
Sampling Framework/proximal sampler, which uses Gibbs sampling on an augmented
distribution and assumes access to the so-called restricted Gaussian oracle
(RGO). The key contribution of this work is the efficient implementation of RGO
for uniform sampling on $K$ via rejection sampling and access to either a
projection oracle or a separation oracle on $K$. In both oracle cases, we
establish non-asymptotic complexities to obtain unbiased samples where the
accuracy is measured in R\'enyi divergence or $\chi^2$-divergence.

### [50] [Smooth Trade-off for Tensor PCA via Sharp Bounds for Kikuchi Matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03061)
*Pravesh K. Kothari,Jeff Xu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文解决了张量PCA中的对数因子必要性猜想，证明了基于Kikuchi层次的谱算法在信号强度λ ≥ Θ_r(1)·n^{-r/4}·ℓ^{1/2-r/4}时成功，移除了先前结果中的√log n因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究张量PCA问题中信号恢复所需的最小信号强度，特别是对数因子是否必要，这对于理解多项式时间算法能否在更低信号强度下恢复信号至关重要，也是张量PCA作为量子加速候选问题的必要条件。

Method: 使用基于Kikuchi层次的谱算法，通过随机矩阵理论中的非渐近技术进行分析。

Result: 证明了谱算法在λ ≥ Θ_r(1)·n^{-r/4}·ℓ^{1/2-r/4}时成功恢复信号，移除了先前结果中的√log n因子，这一尖锐界限之前仅通过自由概率启发的随机矩阵理论非渐近技术对ℓ ≤ 3r/4已知。

Conclusion: 本文完全解决了关于张量PCA中对数因子必要性的猜想，为理解算法在信号恢复中的平滑权衡提供了关键理论支撑。

Abstract: In this work, we revisit algorithms for Tensor PCA: given an order-$r$ tensor
of the form $T = G+\lambda \cdot v^{\otimes r}$ where $G$ is a random symmetric
Gaussian tensor with unit variance entries and $v$ is an unknown boolean vector
in $\{\pm 1\}^n$, what's the minimum $\lambda$ at which one can distinguish $T$
from a random Gaussian tensor and more generally, recover $v$? As a result of a
long line of work, we know that for any $\ell \in \N$, there is a $n^{O(\ell)}$
time algorithm that succeeds when the signal strength $\lambda \gtrsim
\sqrt{\log n} \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$. The question of whether the
logarithmic factor is necessary turns out to be crucial to understanding
whether larger polynomial time allows recovering the signal at a lower signal
strength. Such a smooth trade-off is necessary for tensor PCA being a candidate
problem for quantum speedups[SOKB25]. It was first conjectured by [WAM19] and
then, more recently, with an eye on smooth trade-offs, reiterated in a blogpost
of Bandeira.
  In this work, we resolve these conjectures and show that spectral algorithms
based on the Kikuchi hierarchy \cite{WAM19} succeed whenever $\lambda \geq
\Theta_r(1) \cdot n^{-r/4} \cdot \ell^{1/2-r/4}$ where $\Theta_r(1)$ only hides
an absolute constant independent of $n$ and $\ell$. A sharp bound such as this
was previously known only for $\ell \leq 3r/4$ via non-asymptotic techniques in
random matrix theory inspired by free probability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的数据库规范化方法LDNF，用于处理具有无限可能值的属性，通过约束属性值为有限集合来改进现有规范化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规范化方法未能处理具有无限可能值的非有限区分属性，这些属性可能导致数据异常和查询不准确。

Method: LDNF方法将非有限区分属性转换为有限区分属性，强制属性符合有限值集合。

Result: LDNF与现有范式结合使用，填补了规范化过程中的空白。

Conclusion: 提出了LDNF的正式方法，以改进数据库规范化过程。

Abstract: In modern databases, the practice of data normalization continues to be
important in improving data integrity, minimizing redundancies, and eliminating
anomalies. However, since its inception and consequent improvements, there have
been no attempts to document a method which constrains the values of attributes
capable of only possessing a limited quantity of values. These non-limited
distinct attributes pose a problem throughout many relational databases as they
have the potential to cause data anomalies and query inaccuracies. Thus, a new
database normalization method, Limited Distinct Normal Form (LDNF), is
necessary in order to improve upon the currently established data normalization
process. In brief, LDNF is a method which turns non-limited distinct attributes
into limited distinct attributes by forcing the attributes to conform to a
limited quantity of values. Utilizing LDNF in tandem with existing normal forms
fulfills a need in normalization that is otherwise not present when only using
current methods. A formal approach to LDNF is therefore proposed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于极端值预测的数据增强框架，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强方法，使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，重点研究极端区域的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端值预测在金融和气候变化等领域具有重要应用价值，但面临数据不平衡的挑战。传统数据增强方法主要针对分类和视觉任务，本研究旨在探索数据增强在极端值预测中的应用。

Method: 使用Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度学习模型进行多步预测，结合GANs和SMOTE等数据增强技术，并提出了基于相关性函数的极端值数据增强策略。

Result: SMOTE-based策略在短期和长期预测中均表现出优越的适应性。Conv-LSTM在周期性稳定数据集中表现更好，而BD-LSTM在混沌或非平稳序列中性能更优。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是SMOTE方法能有效提升极端值预测性能，不同深度学习模型在不同数据特性下具有互补优势，为极端值预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

TL;DR: OpenTSLM是一个时间序列语言模型系列，通过将时间序列作为原生模态集成到预训练LLMs中，实现了对任意长度多时间序列的推理。包含两种架构：SoftPrompt（隐式建模）和Flamingo（显式建模），在多个医疗时间序列推理任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs无法处理时间序列数据的局限性，特别是在医疗领域，需要将大量临床信息转化为可操作的见解和数字健康应用。

Method: 提出了两种架构：1) OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt：通过软提示将可学习的时间序列标记与文本标记连接；2) OpenTSLM-Flamingo：通过交叉注意力将时间序列与文本集成。在HAR-CoT、Sleep-CoT和ECG-QA-CoT三个数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: OpenTSLM模型在所有任务中均优于基线方法，在睡眠分期任务中达到69.9 F1，在HAR任务中达到65.4 F1，而仅微调的纯文本模型分别为9.05和52.2。即使是1B参数的OpenTSLM模型也超过了GPT-4o（15.47和2.95）。Flamingo版本在长序列上表现更好且内存需求稳定。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功地将时间序列作为原生模态集成到LLMs中，显著提升了时间序列推理能力，特别是在医疗应用场景中表现出强大的推理能力。所有代码、数据集和模型均已开源。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RainSeer是一个结构感知的降雨场重建框架，利用雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，通过两阶段架构解决雷达数据与地面降雨观测之间的空间对齐和物理转换问题，显著提升了降雨场重建的精度和结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法在重建高分辨率降雨场时往往过度平滑，无法捕捉尖锐过渡和局地极端值，这影响了洪水预报、水文建模和气候分析的准确性。

Method: RainSeer采用物理信息驱动的两阶段架构：Structure-to-Point Mapper通过双向映射将中尺度雷达结构投影到局地地面降雨，实现空间对齐；Geo-Aware Rain Decoder通过因果时空注意力机制捕捉水凝物在下落、融化和蒸发过程中的语义转换。

Result: 在两个公共数据集（RAIN-F和MeteoNet）上的评估显示，RainSeer相比最先进基线方法，MAE降低了超过13.31%，并显著提升了重建降雨场的结构保真度。

Conclusion: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率重新解释为物理结构先验，并采用两阶段物理信息架构，成功解决了降雨场重建中的关键挑战，为高精度降雨监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

TL;DR: Advisor Models是轻量级参数化策略，通过强化学习训练，能够对黑盒模型动态发出自然语言指导指令，实现比静态提示优化更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型作为黑盒服务部署时，模型权重无法修改，定制化仅限于提示。静态提示优化产生单一固定提示，无法适应不同输入、用户或环境。

Method: 使用强化学习训练轻量级参数化策略（Advisor Models），在输入和模型之间插入第二个小模型，基于环境奖励信号对每个实例动态生成自然语言指导指令。

Result: 在涉及推理和个性化的多个领域中，Advisor Models优于静态提示优化器，能够发现环境动态并提高下游任务性能。顾问模型可在黑盒模型间迁移，实现专业化同时保持对分布外输入的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Advisor Models为黑盒系统提供了可学习的接口，其中顾问充当参数化、环境特定的记忆。通过Advisor Models动态优化黑盒模型是实现个性化和环境适应性AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

*Ashish Jha,Valentin Leplat,AH Phan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于预测市场的训练数据选择方法，通过市场机制自动整合多种信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），使用单一流动性参数控制集中度，并引入价格-长度规则处理token预算约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练数据选择方法需要手动组合多种异质信号（不确定性、稀有性、多样性等），权重设置随意，缺乏系统化框架。

Method: 使用成本函数预测市场（LMSR）为每个样本定价，信号作为交易者，通过单一流动性参数控制集中度，引入价格-长度规则处理token预算约束，并添加轻量级多样性头提高覆盖率。

Result: 在GSM8K上（60k token预算），市场方法在保持与强基线相当性能的同时降低了种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU小时；在AGNews上（保留5-25%数据），市场方法在保持竞争力的准确率同时提高了平衡性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架在固定计算预算下统一了多信号数据筛选，适用于提示级推理和分类任务，提供了透明的参数控制机制。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

*Logan Frank,Paul Ardis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了后训练量化(PTQ)在安全关键环境中可能导致的极端性能下降问题，通过知识蒸馏和强化学习发现了可能导致10-65%准确率下降的"有害"网络-策略组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PTQ在安全关键部署环境中可能导致的灾难性性能下降，探索输入分布特征如何引发这种下降，强调在真实世界部署中需要谨慎。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏和强化学习来学习网络和位宽策略对，分析量化下的最坏情况潜在性能下降。

Result: 确认存在"有害"网络-策略组合，多个实例显示准确率下降10-65%，而"鲁棒"对应组合仅下降<2%。通过系统实验识别了最高脆弱点。

Conclusion: 这是理解PTQ引入故障案例的初步步骤，研究结果强调在真实世界部署中需要谨慎，鼓励未来深度学习工作更严格地检验鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAGE是一种流式数据子集选择方法，通过维护梯度几何的紧凑Frequent Directions草图，在O(ℓD)内存中优先选择与共识方向对齐的示例，实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在大数据集上的训练计算和能耗成本高昂，需要更高效的数据子集选择方法。

Method: 使用Frequent Directions草图维护梯度几何，通过两遍处理、GPU友好的流水线，消除N×N成对相似性和显式N×ℓ梯度存储，基于一致性评分选择数据子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAGE使用较小的保留率预算进行训练，同时保持与全数据训练和最新子集选择基准相当的准确性，并减少端到端计算和峰值内存。

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种实用的、恒定内存的替代方案，补充了剪枝和模型压缩，用于高效训练。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

*Tianqi Liu,Kairui Fu,Shengyu Zhang,Wenyan Fan,Zhaocheng Du,Jieming Zhu,Fan Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CHORD框架通过设备-云协作实现个性化混合精度量化，为序列推荐系统提供资源自适应部署方案，无需本地重训练即可实现动态模型适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着移动设备能力提升，将重排序模型部署到设备上变得可行，但资源异构性需要模型压缩。现有量化方法忽视了设备特定的用户兴趣，导致推荐准确性下降，而设备端微调又带来额外计算负担。

Method: CHORD在异构设备上分发随机初始化模型，通过云端的辅助超网络模块识别用户特定的关键参数。参数敏感性分析在多个粒度（层、过滤器、元素级别）进行，实现从用户画像到量化策略的精确映射。通过设备端混合精度量化，实现动态模型适配和加速推理。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和两个流行骨干网络（SASRec和Caser）上的实验证明了CHORD的准确性、效率和适应性。

Conclusion: CHORD通过设备-云协作和混合精度量化，有效解决了在资源受限设备上部署个性化推荐模型的挑战，实现了无需重训练的个性化模型适配。

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

*Jie Li,Andrew McCarthy,Zhizhuo Zhang,Stephen Young*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabPFN模型在生物分子效力预测中表现优异，通过基于不确定性的模型选择策略优化集成学习，无需真实标签即可提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决上下文学习模型对上下文数据敏感的问题，探索在没有真实标签的情况下如何选择最佳模型进行集成。

Method: 使用TabPFN模型和简单序列特征，通过预测的inter-quantile range(IQR)作为不确定性度量，选择不确定性最低的模型进行集成平均。

Result: 在siRNA敲低效力任务中，TabPFN模型超越专业SOTA预测器，模型IQR与真实预测误差呈负相关，基于IQR的集成策略优于朴素集成或单一模型。

Conclusion: 模型不确定性可作为无标签启发式方法，有效优化生物分子效力预测的集成模型选择。

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

*Martino Bernasconi,Andrea Celli,Riccardo Colini-Baldeschi,Federico Fusco,Stefano Leonardi,Matteo Russo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用模板，将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，同时保持其遗憾保证，并应用于延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机顺序模型中的输入序列可能表现出显著的非平稳性，这会阻碍随机学习算法的性能。虽然对抗性输入算法在随机顺序中保持遗憾保证，但一些简单的无遗憾算法在随机顺序实例中会失效。

Method: 设计了一个通用模板来适配随机学习算法到随机顺序模型，不显著影响其遗憾保证。该方法应用于延迟预测、带约束的在线学习和带切换成本的赌博机问题。

Result: 恢复了延迟预测、在线学习约束和带切换成本的赌博机的改进遗憾界。在在线分类中证明，在随机顺序下，可学习性由VC维度而非Littlestone维度表征。

Conclusion: 提出的模板成功将随机学习算法适配到随机顺序模型，提供了与一般对抗模型的进一步分离，特别是在在线分类中VC维度成为可学习性的关键特征。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型训练时间长、能耗高的问题，现代模型需要数月计算时间和千兆瓦时电力消耗。

Method: 结合架构改进和算法优化，针对transformer注意力层和MLP层进行专门优化，最大化模型FLOPs利用率，同时保持与标准transformer实现的兼容性。

Result: 在3B和30B参数的Llama模型上使用SlimPajama-627B数据集进行测试，在多节点H200 GPU集群上实现2-6倍训练吞吐量提升和55%-83%能耗降低。

Conclusion: 这些优化与模型和硬件无关，可广泛应用于transformer架构，并扩展到监督微调和直接偏好优化等后训练阶段。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation
and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce
Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的过程引导测试时采样算法VGB，通过理论基础的回溯机制来更好地应对验证器错误，在语言建模任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时算法结合语言模型生成能力和过程验证器，但验证器中的微小错误会导致标准解码技术的灾难性失败。本文研究是否可以通过更复杂的解码策略来改善这一问题。

Method: 引入VGB算法，将自回归生成解释为部分生成树上的随机游走，使用过程验证器和基础模型指导转移概率，并采用概率性回溯机制。该方法推广了Sinclair-Jerrum随机游走理论。

Result: 在合成和真实语言建模任务上的实验表明，VGB在多种指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VGB算法通过理论基础的回溯机制实现了对验证器错误的更好鲁棒性，为过程引导的测试时采样提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)方法，通过对比学习从高维观测中发现可独立控制的潜在变量，解决了传统方法需要先验因子表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要已知因子表示，要么无法利用因子结构。ACF旨在从高维观测中自动发现可独立控制的状态组件，弥合这一差距。

Method: 使用对比学习方法，利用动作稀疏性（每个动作只影响部分变量）来识别可独立控制的潜在变量。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准测试中，ACF直接从像素观测中恢复了真实可控因子，性能优于基线解缠算法。

Conclusion: ACF成功地从高维观测中发现了可独立控制的潜在变量，为强化学习中的表示学习提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度强化学习(DRL)和有界极值搜索(ES)的混合控制器，用于提高非线性时变系统的鲁棒性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL能够从大数据集中学习以快速控制多参数系统，但在系统模型快速变化时性能会严重下降；而ES能够处理时变系统和未知控制方向，但收敛速度随参数数量增加而减慢且容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将DRL和ES结合形成混合控制器，DRL利用历史数据学习快速控制多参数系统到期望设定点，而ES确保对时变性的鲁棒性。

Result: 混合控制器的性能超过了单独使用DRL或ES的效果，在洛斯阿拉莫斯中子科学中心直线粒子加速器的低能束流传输段自动调谐中进行了数值研究验证。

Conclusion: DRL和有界ES的结合产生了协同效应，既保持了DRL的快速学习能力，又获得了ES对时变系统的鲁棒性保证。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上SFT被视为简单的模仿学习过程，本文挑战这一观点，旨在证明SFT实际上是一种强大的奖励学习机制。

Method: 建立SFT与逆Q学习的等价性，提出基线相对奖励函数从SFT模型中恢复密集奖励信号，并开发Dense-Path REINFORCE方法利用这些奖励进一步改进策略。

Result: Dense-Path REINFORCE方法在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于原始SFT模型。

Conclusion: 本文重新定义了SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是一种强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家演示开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

Motivation: 现有图生成方法通常只对齐谱或度分布，但忽略了特征向量诱导的几何结构和图的全局结构。

Method: 使用谱特征映射将输入和目标图嵌入到连续黎曼流形中，定义嵌入之间的测地线流，并沿这些流匹配分布来生成输出图。

Conclusion: SFMG通过将谱几何与流匹配相结合，为图合成提供了一种新方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升了可扩展性和训练效率。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于动物间变换类(IATC)的模型-大脑比较方法，通过双向映射评估模型能否像典型被试一样表现，解决了模型与大脑活动比较的标准化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏比较人工神经网络模型与大脑活动响应的标准方法，需要建立能够准确映射模型与大脑数据的比较框架。

Method: 使用IATC方法，识别能够准确映射不同被试间神经响应的函数集合，通过双向映射评估模型与大脑数据的匹配程度。

Result: IATC能够解析神经机制的详细特征（如非线性激活函数），实现神经活动的高精度预测，同时保持机制识别的高特异性，能够区分不同脑区的响应模式。

Conclusion: IATC证明了模型预测性与机制准确性之间不存在固有权衡，为模型-大脑比较提供了原则性方法，支持地形深度神经网络作为视觉系统模型。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

TL;DR: 提出AttentiveGRUAE模型，结合注意力机制的GRU自编码器，用于纵向可穿戴数据的时序聚类和结果预测，在抑郁分类和聚类质量上优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够从纵向可穿戴数据中学习紧凑潜在表示、预测抑郁结果并识别行为亚型的集成模型，以提供临床可解释的风险解释。

Method: 使用注意力GRU自编码器联合优化三个目标：序列重构学习潜在表示、二元分类预测抑郁率、GMM软聚类识别行为亚型。

Result: 在372名参与者数据上，聚类质量（轮廓系数0.70）和抑郁分类（AUC 0.74）优于基线；在332名参与者外部验证中保持可重复性（轮廓系数0.63，AUC 0.61）。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE在纵向睡眠数据分析中表现出色，提供临床可解释的亚型分析和时间注意力可视化，识别与睡眠规律变化相关的关键时间窗口。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

TL;DR: 提出HOD-GNN方法，通过利用高阶节点导数来增强消息传递神经网络(MPNNs)的表达能力，在保持计算效率的同时实现与WL层次结构对齐的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图神经网络(GNNs)取得了显著进展，但其有限的表达能力仍然是一个基本挑战。现有研究主要关注架构层次结构，而节点特征的导数虽然被广泛研究，但尚未被用作增强GNN表达能力的手段。

Method: 引入高阶导数GNN(HOD-GNN)，利用基础模型的高阶节点导数生成表达性结构感知节点嵌入，通过第二个GNN在端到端可训练架构中处理。开发了利用图稀疏性和并行性的消息传递算法来计算MPNNs的高阶导数。

Result: 在流行的图学习基准测试中，HOD-GNN在流行的图学习任务上表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 节点导数提供了一种增强GNN表达能力的自然方式，HOD-GNN在表达能力上与WL层次结构对齐，并与子图GNNs和结构编码方案有深刻联系。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been supported by the emergence of
domain-specific software libraries, enabling streamlined workflows and
increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the
availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain

TL;DR: MINTO是一种新的深度强化学习方法，通过在目标网络和在线网络之间选择最小值作为目标估计，实现了更快更稳定的价值函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标网络方法虽然稳定但学习速度慢，而直接使用在线网络作为目标会导致学习不稳定。MINTO旨在结合两者的优点。

Method: 引入新的更新规则，使用目标网络和在线网络之间的最小值作为目标估计，可以无缝集成到各种基于价值和行动者-评论者算法中。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，包括在线和离线强化学习以及离散和连续动作空间，MINTO始终提高性能表现。

Conclusion: MINTO通过简单有效的修改，实现了更快更稳定的价值函数学习，具有广泛的适用性和有效性。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Motivation: 虽然现代研究致力于基于机器学习的大样本水文建模，但这些努力并未必然转化为基于增强物理概念理解的预测改进。

Method: 使用基于质量守恒感知器(MCP)的物理可解释流域尺度模型，在不同水文-地质-气候条件下进行CONUS范围大样本研究，并通过雪情、森林覆盖和气候区等属性掩码评估结果。

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Motivation: 现有特征过滤器依赖统计成对依赖度量来建模特征-目标关系，但当目标依赖于高阶特征交互而非个体贡献时，这种方法会失效。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化互信息近似，通过精心设计的损失函数和稀疏诱导正则化进行特征选择，采用两阶段过程分离表示学习和特征选择。

Result: 在合成和真实欺诈数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉复杂特征-目标关系，并执行精确解。

Conclusion: MINERVA方法能够有效处理传统方法难以捕捉的高阶特征交互问题，在特征选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.

Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,

Motivation: AdaLoRA虽然通过SVD和奇异值剪枝实现了动态秩分配，但在训练过程中存在收敛速度慢和计算开销高的问题。

Method: 使用基于注意力机制的超网络动态生成SVD参数(P, Λ, Q)，而不是直接优化这些参数，通过对生成奇异值的超网络输出进行剪枝来实现动态秩分配。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲性能的情况下实现了更快的收敛速度，在其他基于LoRA的方法上的扩展实验验证了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA通过超网络机制有效解决了AdaLoRA的收敛速度问题，为参数高效微调提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Motivation: 随着学生越来越多地使用大语言模型作为学习辅助工具，需要开发能够处理辅导细微差别的模型，包括识别学生核心需求、提供适应性、个性化指导和准确性。

Method: 构建了包含1,490个样本的数据集，每个样本配有特定评分标准，使用LLM评判器和样本特定评分标准进行可靠、细粒度的自动评估。

Result: 评估了16个前沿LLM，结果显示所有模型得分均低于56%，在辅导技能相关标准上的通过率低于60%。不同模型家族表现出不同优势：Claude模型在支持主动学习方面表现最佳，但在其他两个用例中落后。

Conclusion: 当前前沿LLM在展现完整辅导技能方面存在不足，TutorBench为开发下一代AI导师提供了全面且未饱和的基准。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

TL;DR: 论文证明了对于一类置换等变学习规则，训练过程在神经元之间诱导了双Lipschitz映射，并强约束了神经元分布的拓扑结构。学习率η的大小决定了训练是否保持拓扑结构：当η<η*时保持所有拓扑结构，当η>η*时允许拓扑简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习训练过程中神经元分布的拓扑变化规律，揭示学习率对拓扑结构的影响，以及训练过程中的两个不同阶段。

Method: 通过数学分析证明置换等变学习规则在神经元之间诱导双Lipschitz映射，分析学习率对拓扑约束的影响，并与边缘稳定性现象结合分析训练动态。

Result: 发现学习率存在拓扑临界点η*：低于η*时训练保持所有拓扑结构，高于η*时允许拓扑简化。训练过程分为两个阶段：平滑优化阶段和拓扑简化阶段。

Conclusion: 该理论独立于特定架构或损失函数，使得拓扑方法能够普遍应用于深度学习研究，揭示了学习率对模型表达能力的重要影响。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

Conclusion: 指数集中是训练模型的一个统计规律，为FP8时代的无损低精度浮点设计开辟了原则性路径。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

TL;DR: EvoSpeak是一个将遗传编程与大型语言模型相结合的新框架，旨在提高启发式演化的效率、透明度和适应性，应用于动态柔性作业车间调度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态和大规模场景中，最有效的启发式方法往往非常复杂，这阻碍了可解释性、减慢了收敛速度，并限制了跨任务的可转移性。

Method: EvoSpeak从高质量的GP启发式中学习并提取知识，利用这些知识：(i)生成加速收敛的预热种群，(ii)将不透明的GP树转化为简洁的自然语言解释，(iii)在相关任务间实现知识转移和偏好感知的启发式生成。

Result: 在动态柔性作业车间调度的单目标和多目标实验中，EvoSpeak产生了更有效的启发式方法，提高了演化效率，并提供了增强可用性的人类可读报告。

Conclusion: 通过将GP的符号推理能力与LLMs的解释和生成优势相结合，EvoSpeak推动了现实世界优化问题中智能、透明和用户对齐的启发式方法的发展。

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

TL;DR: 提出了GRAFT框架统一RAFT变体，并引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别进行分布整形，通过偏差-方差权衡解释其有效性，还提出无需显式奖励的逆噪声校正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型能有效捕捉训练数据分布，但需要根据下游应用使用奖励函数来调整这些分布。现有策略梯度方法在扩散模型中因边缘似然不可计算而受限。

Method: 统一RAFT变体为GRAFT，证明其隐式执行带重塑奖励的PPO；引入P-GRAFT在中间噪声级别整形分布；提出逆噪声校正改进流模型。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、布局生成、分子生成和无条件图像生成上验证。Stable Diffusion 2在T2I基准上VQAScore优于策略梯度方法，相对基础模型提升8.81%；无条件图像生成中逆噪声校正在更低FLOPs下改善FID。

Conclusion: GRAFT框架有效统一了RAFT变体，P-GRAFT通过中间噪声整形实现更有效的微调，逆噪声校正可在无显式奖励下改进流模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

TL;DR: 提出了RAMAC框架，将表达性生成actor与分布critic结合，在离线强化学习中实现风险敏感学习，在保持高回报的同时降低尾部风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键领域，离线强化学习需要提供高回报且避免灾难性风险。现有风险规避方法过于保守且限制策略类别，而表达性策略仅用于风险中性设置。

Method: RAMAC框架耦合表达性生成actor与分布critic，通过生成路径区分复合目标（分布风险和BC损失），在复杂多模态场景中实现风险敏感学习。

Result: 在Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC（使用扩散和流匹配actor）在大多数任务中保持强回报的同时，持续提升CVaR0.1性能。

Conclusion: RAMAC框架成功解决了离线强化学习中风险敏感性与策略表达性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Conclusion: 这些新工具支持新的分析能力，如最佳性能的置信区间估计和有效超参数数量确定，相关工具已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Conclusion: 这是首个基于几何布朗运动的生物启发式生成模型，使用乘法更新规则，为生物启发的机器学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒属性图聚类方法RAGC，通过混合协作增强(HCA)和对比样本自适应差分感知(CSADA)来解决现有对比属性图聚类方法在节点-边级别增强交互和对比样本处理方面的局限性。

Motivation: 现有对比属性图聚类方法主要依赖边作为辅助信息获取节点级嵌入表示，仅关注节点级增强，忽视了边级嵌入增强以及不同粒度下节点级和边级增强之间的交互作用。同时，它们通常平等对待所有对比样本对，忽略了难易正负样本对之间的显著差异，限制了判别能力。

Conclusion: RAGC通过混合协作增强和对比样本自适应差分感知策略，有效提升了表示学习的判别能力，在属性图聚类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

TL;DR: TokenFlow是一个新颖的LLM服务系统，通过抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理来提升文本流式性能，在保持总体token吞吐量的同时，显著提高了有效吞吐量并降低了首token延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时LLM交互需要流式token生成，但标准LLM服务系统存在非抢占式请求调度和被动内存管理导致的资源利用率低、请求处理并行度差的问题。

Method: TokenFlow采用抢占式请求调度和主动KV缓存管理，动态基于token缓冲区占用率和token消费率来优先处理请求，并在后台主动在GPU和CPU内存间传输KV缓存，同时重叠I/O与计算以最小化请求抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B模型上的多GPU实验表明，TokenFlow实现了高达82.5%的有效吞吐量提升，同时将P99 TTFT降低了80.2%，且不降低总体token吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过创新的调度和缓存管理策略，显著提升了LLM服务的流式性能，为实时交互应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了模型消隐技术对LLM安全性的影响，发现某些安全训练方法在激活编辑后仍保持鲁棒性，并提出了将推理时编辑纳入安全评估的实用协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究常见的LLM安全干预措施（如拒绝训练或元标签训练）在简单的激活编辑后是否仍然有效，以评估模型安全性的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用模型消隐技术（一种轻量级投影方法）移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B的安全预训练检查点上进行控制评估，对20个系统（原始和消隐后）使用100个提示进行测试，并通过多法官分类响应。

Result: 研究在检查点级别表征了哪些数据驱动的安全组件在消隐后保持鲁棒，量化了法官选择对评估结果的影响，并验证了模型能否识别自身输出的拒绝行为。

Conclusion: 提出了将推理时编辑整合到安全评估中的实用协议，为LLM安全性评估提供了新的框架和方法。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

*Yuanfan Li,Yunwen Lei,Zheng-Chu Guo,Yiming Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了深度ReLU网络在梯度下降训练下能够达到接近最优的泛化率，消除了之前工作中对网络深度的指数依赖，仅保留多项式依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么只能获得次优的O(1/√n)泛化率，要么需要平滑激活函数且对网络深度L有指数依赖。本文旨在为深度ReLU网络建立最优泛化率，仅保留对深度的多项式依赖。

Method: 通过精心平衡优化误差和泛化误差，在数据满足NTK可分性假设下，采用新颖的技术控制参考模型附近的激活模式，从而获得更尖锐的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Result: 证明了梯度下降在深度ReLU网络中的超额风险率为Õ(L⁴(1+γL²)/(nγ²))，这与最优SVM型率Õ(1/(nγ²))仅相差深度相关因子。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为深度ReLU网络建立了最优泛化率，关键技术创新在于对激活模式的精细控制，使得梯度下降能够实现与核方法相当的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

*Théo Dupuy,Binbin Xu,Stéphane Perrey,Jacky Montmain,Abdelhak Imoussaten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的在线共形预测方法，通过使用更广泛的函数来量化预测区间的相关性，而不是简单的二元评估，从而产生更窄的预测区间同时保持覆盖有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线共形预测方法在阈值更新步骤中只关注预测区间的有效性（真实值是否在区间内），而忽略了区间的相关性。本文旨在利用这个被忽视的方面来改进方法。

Method: 提出在阈值更新步骤中用更广泛的函数类替换二元评估（内部/外部），这些函数使用真实值来量化预测区间的相关性，有助于防止阈值突变，可能产生更窄的预测区间。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，这些函数可以产生比现有OCP方法更紧密的区间，同时保持覆盖有效性。

Conclusion: 通过量化预测区间相关性的函数来增强阈值更新步骤，能够产生更窄的预测区间，同时保持覆盖保证，改进了现有的在线共形预测方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

*Hemang Jain,Shailender Goyal,Divyansh Pandey,Karthik Vaidhyanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CLEAR方法，首次对transformer架构的核心组件进行细粒度推理能耗分析，发现注意力块的能耗与FLOP不成比例，为构建节能transformer模型提供组件级优化基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推理在全球范围内持续进行，已成为AI能耗的主要来源，但现有研究缺乏细粒度测量方法，仅报告粗略的模型级指标，将能效视为次要考虑因素。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样克服微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗监测的时间不匹配问题，评估了涵盖四种架构类型的15个模型。

Result: 注意力块每FLOP消耗显著更多能量，表明能耗与FLOP计数不成比例，FLOP无法准确反映组件级真实能耗；组件级能耗方差保持在9.5%以下，捕获了模型总能耗的90%以上。

Conclusion: 建立了详细的组件级能耗基准，为通过组件级优化构建节能transformer模型提供了初步见解和基础。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

*Sung Ho Jo,Seonghwi Kim,Minwoo Chae*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层Group DRO方法，解决传统方法对组内分布偏移的脆弱性，特别是在样本有限的少数群体中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法容易受到虚假相关性的影响，特别是在测试数据分布偏移时。现有方法如Group DRO虽然对组间偏移具有鲁棒性，但对组内分布偏移仍然脆弱，这在样本有限的少数群体中尤为常见。

Method: 提出分层扩展的Group DRO方法，同时处理组间和组内不确定性，提供多层次的分布偏移鲁棒性。

Result: 在新设计的模拟现实少数群体分布偏移的基准测试中，该方法表现出强大的鲁棒性，而现有鲁棒学习方法均失败。同时在标准基准测试中也取得优越性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，扩大模糊集以更好地捕捉组间和组内分布不确定性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动模型缺乏知识指导，导致长期健康预测不可靠，需要克服电池退化行为的复杂性（非线性、噪声、容量再生等）。

Method: 采用信号分解获取不同频段电池信号，开发双流深度学习架构：一流捕获长期低频退化趋势，另一流建模高频短期动态。使用粒子滤波器优化基于经验研究的双指数函数知识模型参数。

Result: 在两个主流数据集上，Karma比最先进算法的平均误差分别降低50.6%和32.6%，显示出优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Karma模型通过知识引导和频率自适应学习，实现了物理一致且可靠的电池健康预测和不确定性量化，具有广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Motivation: 神经网络通常在NPU和GPU等硬件加速器上运行，但这些加速器成本高昂且难以扩展资源来处理实时工作负载波动。

Method: FlexiQ采用自适应混合精度量化，对值范围小的特征通道应用低比特计算，使用高效的比特降低方法最小化量化误差，并实时调整低比特通道比例。

Result: 在11个卷积和基于transformer的视觉模型上评估，FlexiQ在4位模型上平均精度提高6.6%，优于四种最先进的量化技术。50% 4位模型仅损失0.6%精度，达到100% 4位模型相对于8位模型40%的加速效果。

Conclusion: FlexiQ在NPU和GPU上引入最小运行时开销，证明了其硬件效率和整体性能优势，能够有效管理推理工作负载波动。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMark是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的水印框架，解决了传统水印方法在非顺序解码模型上失效的问题，通过三种互补策略实现高检测率和文本质量保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型提供比自回归模型更快的生成速度，但现有水印方法因其非顺序解码特性而失效，需要专门设计的水印方案。

Method: 提出三种水印策略：预测水印（使用模型预测的令牌）、双向水印（利用扩散解码特有的前后依赖关系）、预测-双向水印（结合前两种方法最大化检测强度）。

Result: 在多个dLLM上的实验显示，DMark在1%误报率下达到92.0-99.5%的检测率，同时保持文本质量，而现有方法的朴素适配仅能达到49.6-71.2%的检测率。

Conclusion: DMark证明了非自回归语言模型的有效水印是可行的，并展示了对抗文本操作的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) offer faster generation than
autoregressive models while maintaining comparable quality, but existing
watermarking methods fail on them due to their non-sequential decoding. Unlike
autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出在训练过程中对状态空间模型进行降维，通过Hankel奇异值分析识别并保留高影响力维度，从而在保持表达能力的同时加速优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在处理长序列任务时面临计算负担与表达能力之间的平衡挑战，需要在保持模型性能的同时降低计算成本。

Method: 利用控制理论中的Hankel奇异值分析和平衡截断方法，在训练过程中识别高能量状态维度并进行降维，适用于线性时不变SSM和选择性模型。

Result: 实验表明训练中降维显著加速了优化过程，压缩后的模型保留了任务关键结构，性能优于直接训练的小维度模型。

Conclusion: 从大模型开始并在训练过程中逐步缩小的SSM能够在保持高性能的同时实现计算效率。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Motivation: 解决非IID设置下联邦学习性能不佳和公平性差的问题，通过提升表现不佳的客户端来改善整体系统表现。

Method: 整合了动态提升机制和自适应梯度聚合策略，借鉴多类AdaBoost算法的权重机制，为本地错误率较低的客户端分配更高权重，同时动态调整焦点损失参数来强调难分类样本。

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10三个基准数据集上的评估显示，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto实现了更好的公平性和有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: FeDABoost框架有效提升了联邦学习在非IID设置下的公平性和性能，为联邦学习的实际应用提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Conclusion: 提出的迭代精炼框架为VAR提供了统一视角，使其能够利用扩散模型工具同时保持少步、尺度并行的生成特性。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Motivation: 现有的持续强化学习研究主要关注风险中性决策，即优化期望长期性能。本文旨在探索风险感知决策在持续强化学习中的应用，填补这一理论空白。

Method: 首先分析经典风险度量理论与持续设置的不兼容性，然后引入新的遍历风险度量类别，该类别与持续学习兼容，最后通过案例研究和实证分析验证理论。

Result: 研究表明经典风险度量理论在当前形式下与持续设置不兼容，提出的遍历风险度量在风险感知持续学习中具有直观吸引力和理论合理性。

Conclusion: 本文为风险感知持续强化学习建立了理论基础，提出的遍历风险度量为解决持续学习中的风险平衡问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

Motivation: 现有深度神经网络和梯度提升模型在预测个性化健康结果时牺牲了可解释性，且未能充分处理个体间差异。

Method: 使用主题自适应稀疏线性框架，结合普通最小二乘回归和主题特定交互，采用迭代向后特征消除方法构建稀疏模型，并开发回归-阈值方法优化序数目标的F1分数。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集上的评估显示，SASL-LightGBM混合框架在预测性能上与复杂黑盒方法相当，但参数更少、透明度更高。

Conclusion: SASL框架在保持可解释性的同时实现了与黑盒方法相当的预测性能，为临床实践提供了清晰可操作的见解。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear

TL;DR: 提出基于迁移学习的方法预测船舶轴功率，通过在高频数据上预训练模型，然后用低频午报数据微调，相比仅用午报数据训练，在不同类型船舶上均显著降低了预测误差。

Result: 相比仅用午报数据训练的模型，该方法在姊妹船上平均绝对百分比误差降低10.6%，相似船上降低3.6%，不同船上降低5.3%。

Conclusion: 基于迁移学习的方法能有效利用高频数据知识提升低频午报数据的轴功率预测精度，在不同类型船舶上均表现出良好效果。

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖人工特征工程引入偏差，深度学习缺乏可解释性，限制了精神疾病诊断模型的临床应用。

Method: 基于图神经网络的信息瓶颈框架，在模型训练过程中自动识别最具信息量的脑区子图作为生物标志物。

Result: 在三个多队列精神分裂症数据集上优于9种现有方法，诊断准确性更高且具有泛化能力，识别出的子图与已知临床生物标志物一致。

Conclusion: BrainIB++框架在保持高诊断性能的同时提供了可解释的生物标志物，有望促进精神疾病诊断模型的临床转化。

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

TL;DR: RoiRL是一种轻量级的离线强化学习方法，用于改进大型语言模型的推理能力，无需真实奖励标签，训练速度比现有方法快2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时强化学习(TTRL)方法依赖多数投票奖励，但需要大量在线强化学习，计算成本高昂。RoiRL旨在消除对参考模型的依赖，降低内存和计算需求。

Method: 提出RoiRL框架，通过优化加权对数似然目标来替代在线强化学习，实现稳定的离线训练，无需维护参考模型。

Result: 实验结果显示RoiRL训练速度比TTRL快2.5倍，在推理基准测试中表现一致优于TTRL。

Conclusion: RoiRL为无需标签的自改进大型语言模型提供了一条可扩展的路径，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large
language models (LLMs) but typically requires ground-truth rewards. Test-Time
Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DMIS是一个统一的框架，用于从模糊监督中训练鲁棒的扩散模型，通过分解目标为生成和分类组件来处理不精确的标签信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件扩散模型的训练通常依赖大规模数据集，但这些数据集中的条件输入往往包含不精确信息（如噪声、模糊或不完整的标签），这会导致条件不匹配并降低生成质量。

Method: 基于似然最大化推导框架，将目标分解为生成组件（建模模糊标签分布）和分类组件（使用扩散分类器推断类后验概率），并通过优化的时间步采样策略提高效率。

Result: 在多种模糊监督形式（图像生成、弱监督学习、噪声数据集压缩）上的广泛实验表明，DMIS能够持续生成高质量和类判别性的样本。

Conclusion: DMIS是扩散模型中首个系统研究模糊监督问题的框架，能够有效处理不精确的标签信息，提升生成质量。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

<details>

Motivation: 现有模型依赖计算昂贵的预处理和多阶段训练，且无法发现明确的基因相互作用，需要更高效和可解释的细胞分化建模方法

Method: 使用编码器-解码器架构，其潜在表示是控制细胞从干细胞到组织细胞演化的局部线性ODE，完全端到端训练（除标准PCA预处理外）

Result: 在单细胞基准测试中达到竞争性性能，在扩展到更大数据集和跨多个数据集联合训练方面超越现有基线，学习到的基因相互作用与TRRUST数据库验证一致

Conclusion: Cell-MNN提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的细胞分化建模方法，能够学习生物一致的基因相互作用

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Conclusion: ZeroShotOpt提供了一个可重用的优化基础，为未来扩展和改进奠定了基础。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC

outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform

clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在可靠和可解释的临床可变长度时间序列分类方面的潜力。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在解决旅行商问题方面取得了进展，但对于接近旅行商问题关注较少，主要挑战在于其基于邻域的访问标准。

Method: 使用离散化方案制定马尔可夫决策过程，提出UD3RL框架，包含节点解码器和位置解码器，采用k近邻子图交互策略增强空间推理，定制REINFORCE算法进行训练。

Result: UD3RL在解质量和运行时间上优于传统方法，在不同问题规模、空间分布和半径范围内表现出强泛化能力，对动态环境具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL框架有效解决了接近旅行商问题，展现了优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流式生成模型在蛋白质骨架生成中表现出色，但采样速度慢（需要数百次迭代步骤），限制了其在大规模蛋白质发现中的实际应用。

Method: 采用Score identity Distillation (SiD)分数蒸馏策略，结合多步生成和推理时噪声调制技术，训练少步蛋白质骨架生成器。

Result: 蒸馏后的少步生成器实现了超过20倍的采样速度提升，同时在可设计性、多样性和新颖性方面与Proteina教师模型保持相当水平。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了推理成本，使基于扩散的模型更接近实际蛋白质工程应用，支持大规模计算机辅助蛋白质设计。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Abstract: Inferring trajectories from longitudinal spatially-resolved omics data is
fundamental to understanding the dynamics of structural and functional tissue
changes in development, regeneration and repair, disease progression, and

ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for
modeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics
data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and
qualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence. Our code is

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Conclusion: 这些发现为部署场景中的无监督模型评估提供了实用且可推广的基础。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 该分布框架适用于行为分析和风险感知模仿学习，能够捕获专家行为中更丰富的结构。

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our

Conclusion: 基于平衡符号图的谱去噪方法为EEG信号分类提供了一种参数效率高且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 本文开发了贝叶斯E(3)等变机器学习势函数，通过联合能量-力负对数似然损失函数和迭代重分层多体消息传递，解决了当前MLPs在不确定性量化方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习势函数在不确定性量化方面存在不足，限制了其在主动学习、校准和分布外检测中的可靠性。

Method: 提出贝叶斯E(3)等变MLPs，引入联合能量-力负对数似然损失函数，系统评估多种贝叶斯方法，并使用贝叶斯主动学习分歧策略。

Result: 贝叶斯MLPs在保持最先进模型精度的同时，实现了不确定性引导的主动学习、分布外检测和能量/力校准。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯等变神经网络为开发大规模原子模拟的不确定性感知MLPs提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

*Marc Lelarge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图对齐问题的链式GNN方法，通过训练一系列GNN网络迭代优化相似度矩阵，在推理时产生自举效应，显著提升了图对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在组合优化问题上表现不佳，限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决图对齐这一NP难问题，提升GNN在此类问题上的性能。

Method: 使用链式GNN训练过程，每个网络学习迭代优化前一个网络产生的相似度矩阵。采用在节点对上操作的架构，捕获标准消息传递网络无法表示的全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，链式GNN比现有方法准确率提高3倍以上，在常规图上唯一成功解决所有竞争方法失败的实例。与传统优化方法结合后，在图对齐基准上大幅超越最先进求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN方法有效提升了图对齐问题的求解性能，证明了GNN在组合优化问题上的潜力，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

*Ali Azizpour,Madeline Navarro,Santiago Segarra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于图神经网络的适应性节点特征选择方法，通过在训练过程中识别并移除不必要的特征来提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构数据引入了复杂的依赖关系，传统特征重要性度量方法可能不适用，需要开发能够衡量特征对模型输出贡献的方法来帮助解释决策、降低维度甚至通过消除无用变量来提升性能。

Method: 提出了一种模型和任务无关的方法，基于在验证集上对特征值进行置换后性能变化来确定相关特征，通过理论分析表征GNN性能如何依赖于节点数据和图结构之间的关系。

Result: 不仅能在训练结束时返回特征重要性分数，还能跟踪特征被逐步丢弃时相关性的演变过程，从而监控特征是否被有效消除，并能用此技术评估其他指标。

Conclusion: 实证结果验证了该方法对不同图架构的灵活性以及对更具挑战性的图学习设置的适应性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度的层选择方法，通过分析激活空间的拓扑特征来识别重要层，用于在资源受限设备上进行高效的模型重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘和移动设备上使用预训练神经网络时，需要高效适应用户特定的运行时数据分布，但受限于计算和内存资源。当前方法依赖标签数据、完整反向传播或服务器端元训练，不适合资源受限设备。

Method: AdaBet通过Betti Numbers分析层激活空间的拓扑特征，仅使用前向传播来对重要层进行排序，无需标签或梯度。

Result: 在16对基准模型和数据集上评估，AdaBet比基于梯度的基线方法平均分类准确率提高5%，平均峰值内存消耗减少40%。

Conclusion: AdaBet提供了一种无需梯度的高效层选择方法，适用于资源受限设备的模型重训练和适应。

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

Conclusion: 该管道成功地将技术性反事实解释转化为自然语言叙述，使解释更易于理解，同时通过知识蒸馏实现了小型模型的高效部署。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

Motivation: 通过高速率量化理论的视角，研究MoE模型在回归任务中的理论特性，特别是当专家数量足够大时的近似误差分析。

Conclusion: 理论上和实证上证明了MoE学习中近似误差与估计误差之间的权衡如何依赖于专家数量。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于不确定性的主动学习方法在未校准的模型上效果不佳，特别是深度神经网络的不确定性通常未校准，导致泛化性能差和校准误差高。

Result: 经验证明该方法在池式主动学习设置中优于其他基线方法，具有更低的校准误差和泛化误差。

Conclusion: 通过主动学习校准误差估计，可以有效降低模型在未标记数据和未见测试数据上的校准误差，提高泛化性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Conclusion: 预热策略在理论和实践中都具有显著优势，能有效加速深度神经网络的训练收敛过程。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于异构且主要资源受限边缘设备的实用可扩展联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

Result: 理论证明DQUCB相比QUCB获得更好的遗憾保证；实验显示在多个RL任务和真实COVID-19患者分配任务中，DQUCB具有更低遗憾和更好的计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB算法有效解决了非稳态强化学习中的分布漂移问题，在理论和实际应用中均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 叠加解耦对于映射度量揭示神经代码之间真实表示对齐是必要的。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM推理策略Best-of-Majority (BoM)，结合了多数投票和Best-of-N的优点，在Pass@k设置下实现了最优的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM推理策略如多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中表现不佳，特别是在Pass@k评估设置下，这些方法无法随着k和采样预算N的增加而有效扩展。

Method: 提出Best-of-Majority (BoM)策略，首先将候选限制在N个样本中高频出现的响应，然后选择奖励最高的前k个响应。

Result: 理论证明当采样预算N=Ω(C*)时，BoM的遗憾为O(ε_opt + √(ε_RM²C*/k))，并建立了匹配的下界，证明算法是最小极大最优的。实验结果显示BoM在数学问题推理中优于多数投票和BoN。

Conclusion: BoM是一种在Pass@k设置下最优的LLM推理策略，其性能不会随着N的增加而下降，且在实际应用中表现优异。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)方法来解决RLVR训练中的探索瓶颈问题，通过保护有价值的低概率探索性token（称为"推理火花"）来维持有效的探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在复杂推理中推动了大语言模型的发展，但训练过程中存在性能瓶颈，当策略熵崩溃时性能停滞，表明探索能力丧失。现有方法通常通过保持高策略熵来解决，但缺乏对有意义探索机制的研究。

Method: 引入低概率正则化(Lp-Reg)，其核心机制是将策略正则化到一个启发式代理分布。该代理分布通过过滤掉假定噪声token并对剩余候选进行重新归一化构建，从而放大"推理火花"的概率，并通过KL散度保护这些有价值的token不被消除。

Result: 实验显示Lp-Reg能够在约1,000步内实现稳定的在线策略训练，而基线熵控制方法在此阶段会崩溃。该方法在五个数学基准测试上达到60.17%的平均准确率，比先前方法提高了2.66%。

Conclusion: Lp-Reg通过保护低概率探索性token实现了持续有效的探索，解决了RLVR训练中的探索瓶颈问题，取得了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.
