Existing models propose that individuals form opinions based on a\nweighted average of their peers' opinions and their own beliefs.

In return, the PT's performance can be enhanced by SU's\nbackscattered signal, forming a mutualistic relationship. However, the low\nmodulation rate causes extremely inferior transmission rates for SUs. To\nimprove the SU transmission rate, this paper proposes a new mutualistic SR with\nHAPC to explore the tradeoff between BC and AC in terms of power consumption\nand transmission rate, enabling each SU to transmit signal via passive BC and\nAC alternatively. We propose two problems to maximize the total rate of all SUs\nunder the fixed and dynamic SIC ordering, respectively. The fixed SIC\nordering-based problem is to jointly optimize the SUs' reflection coefficients,\nthe transmit power of each SU during AC, and the time allocation for each SU\nduring BC and AC, subject to the energy causality constraint and the PT's\ntransmission rate gain constraint. In addition to pondering the constraints\ninvolved in the fixed SIC ordering-based problem, the dynamic SIC\nordering-based problem, which is a mixed integer programming one, further\nconsiders the SIC ordering constraint. The above two problems are solved by our\nproposed SCA-based and BCD-based iterative algorithms, respectively. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that: 1) the proposed mutualistic SR system outperforms\ntraditional designs in terms of the rates achieved by SUs under the same\nconstraints; 2) the total rate of all SUs under the dynamic SIC ordering is\nlarger than that of the fixed one when the PT's minimum rate gain is high, and\nbecomes nearly identical when the PT's minimum rate gain is low."}

Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate\nthat network configuration parameters-specifically, activation function\nselection (tanh vs. sin vs. ReLU), network depth (4-8 hidden layers), width\n(64-256 neurons), and training methodology (collocation points, epoch\ncount)-significantly influence convergence characteristics. We observe that\ntanh activation yields stable convergence across configurations, whereas sine\nactivation can attain marginally lower errors and training times in isolated\ncases, but occasionally produce nonphysical artefacts. Our comparative analysis\nwith traditional numerical methods shows that optimally configured DNNs offer\ncompetitive accuracy with notably different computational trade-offs.\nFurthermore, we identify fundamental limitations of standard feed-forward\narchitectures when handling singular or piecewise-constant solutions, providing\nempirical evidence that such networks inherently oversmooth sharp features due\nto the natural function space limitations of standard activation functions.\nThis work contributes to the growing body of research on neural network-based\nscientific computing by providing practitioners with empirical guidelines for\nDNN implementation while illuminating fundamental theoretical constraints that\nmust be overcome to expand their applicability to more challenging physical\nsystems with discontinuities."}

This has motivated the\ndevelopment of multimodal datasets and methods for Music Information Retrieval\n(MIR) tasks such as genre classification or autotagging. Music can be described\nat different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level\nof artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect\nthis aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to\nfill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a\ndataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All\nA+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level\ndataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image\nrepresentations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums.\nFurthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows\naccess to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item\ninteraction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR\ntasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of\ngranularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on\nmultimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in\nmissing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre\nclassification in the movie domain. Our experiments show that images are more\ninformative for classifying the genres of artists and albums, and that several\nmultimodal models for genre classification struggle in generalizing across\ndomains.

Music can be described\nat different levels of granularity, for instance defining genres at the level\nof artists or music albums. However, most datasets for multimodal MIR neglect\nthis aspect and provide data at the level of individual music tracks. We aim to\nfill this gap by providing Music4All Artist and Album (Music4All A+A), a\ndataset for multimodal MIR tasks based on music artists and albums. Music4All\nA+A is built on top of the Music4All-Onion dataset, an existing track-level\ndataset for MIR tasks. Music4All A+A provides metadata, genre labels, image\nrepresentations, and textual descriptors for 6,741 artists and 19,511 albums.\nFurthermore, since Music4All A+A is built on top of Music4All-Onion, it allows\naccess to other multimodal data at the track level, including user--item\ninteraction data. This renders Music4All A+A suitable for a broad range of MIR\ntasks, including multimodal music recommendation, at several levels of\ngranularity. To showcase the use of Music4All A+A, we carry out experiments on\nmultimodal genre classification of artists and albums, including an analysis in\nmissing-modality scenarios, and a quantitative comparison with genre\nclassification in the movie domain.

The\nMelting Pot contest is a social AI evaluation suite designed to assess the\ncooperation capabilities of AI systems. In this paper, we apply a Bayesian\napproach known as Measurement Layouts to infer the capability profiles of\nmulti-agent systems in the Melting Pot contest.

However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the\nendogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure\naccurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)\nprovides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting\naccuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous\nvariables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage\nfuture exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal\nrelationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their\nperformance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous\nvariables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework\nDAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel\ndimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,\nwe first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal\ndiscovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future\nexogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module\nthat incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of\nforecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous\nvariables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar\ndesign principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical\nexogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal\ninjection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the\nprediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables."}

In\ncontrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution\nusing a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL\ndivergence between the policy and the target distribution.

This setting\ncan be framed as a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environment with\nfull cooperative reward among the autonomous vehicles. While methods such as\nMulti-agent Proximal Policy Optimization can be effective in training MARL\ntasks, they often fail to resolve local conflict between agents and are unable\nto generalize to stochastic events. In this paper, we propose a Local State\nAttention module to assist the input state representation.

We analyzed an inpatient dataset from an\nIrish acute hospital, incorporating diagnostic codes, ward transitions, patient\ndemographics, infection-related variables and contact network features. Several\nTransformer-based architectures were benchmarked alongside traditional machine\nlearning models. Clinical outcomes were predicted, and XAI techniques were\napplied to interpret model decisions. Our framework successfully demonstrated\nthe utility of Transformer-based models, with TabTransformer consistently\noutperforming baselines across multiple clinical prediction tasks, especially\nfor CPE acquisition (AUROC and sensitivity). We found infection-related\nfeatures, including historical hospital exposure, admission context, and\nnetwork centrality measures, to be highly influential in predicting patient\noutcomes and CPE acquisition risk. Explainability analyses revealed that\nfeatures like \"Area of Residence\", \"Admission Ward\" and prior admissions are\nkey risk factors.
