However, when agents\nhave no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge:\nthe joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which\nslows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates\nthis issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not\non who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate\nfictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency\nof the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents'\nindividual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP. In\nessence, by aggregating the agents' actions, we reduce the action space without\nlosing the convergence guarantees.

Prior work adopts two broad approaches. First is the state of the art\nmorsel-driven parallelism, whose vanilla application in GDBMSs parallelizes\ncomputations at the source node level. Second is to parallelize each iteration\nof the computation at the frontier level. We show that these approaches can be\nseen as part of a design space of morsel dispatching policies based on picking\ndifferent granularities of morsels. We then empirically study the question of\nwhich policies parallelize better in practice under a variety of datasets and\nquery workloads that contain one to many source nodes. We show that these two\npolicies can be combined in a hybrid policy that issues morsels both at the\nsource node and frontier levels. We then show that the multi-source\nbreadth-first search optimization from prior work can also be modeled as a\nmorsel dispatching policy that packs multiple source nodes into multi-source\nmorsels. We implement these policies inside a single system, the Kuzu GDBMS,\nand evaluate them both within Kuzu and across other systems. We show that the\nhybrid policy captures the behavior of both source morsel-only and frontier\nmorsel-only policies in cases when these approaches parallelize well, and\nout-perform them on queries when they are limited, and propose it as a robust\napproach to parallelizing recursive queries.

This is due to the natural\ncoupling of recommender systems and federated learning architectures: the data\noriginates from distributed clients (mostly mobile devices held by users),\nwhich are highly related to privacy. In a centralized recommender system\n(CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and\nprovides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the\nstep of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded\nto each client.

Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially\nexplains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also\nconsider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained\nspecifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve\nprediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant\nvariations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities,\ncurrently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a\nprincipled data-fitting tool."}

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream.

To exploit this property, ALSA employs an\nanchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in\nlogit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle\nvariations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive\nexperiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's\nsuperiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines. Notably, ALSA's\nrobustness under significant distribution shifts highlights its potential as a\npractical tool for reliable model evaluation."}

The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of\nhow close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to\nnavigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical\ndistances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a\nHungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity\nsimulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of\nCord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes\nfor non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx\nreduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,\nand up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users."}

To this end, we study whether language models\nexhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent\nsafety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval)\nthat measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user\nrequest is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current\nopen- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and\nthat, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve\nperformance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak\nconfidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces\nshould be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty\nof our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure\nthrough various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn\nconversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our\nresults suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling\nconfidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be\ntrained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes\nsettings."}

Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor\nawareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor\nscaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents\n-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where\nhumans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's\nbehavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only\npre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at\nFPR = 0.01.
