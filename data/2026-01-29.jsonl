A \\emph{rebalancing} transfers assets directly from one CFMM's pool to another's, bypassing the CFMMs' standard trading protocols. In any \\emph{arbitrage-prone} configuration, we prove there exists a rebalancing to an \\textit{arbitrage-free} configuration that strictly increases some CFMMs' liquidities without reducing the liquidities of the others. Moreover, we prove that a configuration is arbitrage-free if and only if it is \\emph{Pareto efficient} under rebalancing, meaning that any further direct asset transfers must decrease some CFMM's liquidity. We prove that for any log-concave trading function, including the ubiquitous constant product market maker, the search for an optimal, arbitrage-free rebalancing that maximizes global liquidity while ensuring no participant is worse off can be cast as a convex optimization problem with a unique, computationally tractable solution. We extend this framework to \\emph{mixed rebalancing}, where a subset of participating CFMMs use a combination of direct transfers and standard trades to transition to an arbitrage-free configuration while harvesting arbitrage profits from non-participating CFMMs, and from price oracle market makers such as centralized exchanges. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for future AMM protocols that proactively defend liquidity providers against arbitrage."}

Our empirical analysis reveals a counterintuitive flaw in this paradigm: while promotion rescues low-to-medium quality content, it can harm high-quality content by forcing exposure to suboptimal audiences, polluting engagement signals and downgrading future recommendation. We recast content promotion as a dual-objective optimization that balances short-term value acquisition with long-term model improvement. To make this tractable at bid time in content promotion, we introduce a decomposable surrogate objective, gradient coverage, and establish its formal connection to Fisher Information and optimal experimental design. We design a two-stage auto-bidding algorithm based on Lagrange duality that dynamically paces budget through a shadow price and optimizes impression-level bids using per-impression marginal utilities. To address missing labels at bid time, we propose a confidence-gated gradient heuristic, paired with a zeroth-order variant for black-box models that reliably estimates learning signals in real time. We provide theoretical guarantees, proving monotone submodularity of the composite objective, sublinear regret in online auction, and budget feasibility. Extensive offline experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the framework: it outperforms baselines, achieves superior final AUC/LogLoss, adheres closely to budget targets, and remains effective when gradients are approximated zeroth-order. These results show that strategic, information-aware promotion can improve long-term model performance and organic outcomes beyond naive impression-maximization strategies."}

While designed to improve mobility, such interventions can also create inequality. In this paper, we show that disparities arise not only from the structure of the network itself but also from differences in how commuters adapt to it. We model commuters as reinforcement learning agents who adapt their travel choices at different learning rates, reflecting unequal access to resources and information. To capture potential efficiency-fairness tradeoffs, we introduce the Price of Learning (PoL), a measure of inefficiency during learning. We analyze both a stylized network -- inspired in the well-known Braess's paradox, yet with two-source nodes -- and an abstraction of a real-world metro system (Amsterdam). Our simulations show that network expansions can simultaneously increase efficiency and amplify inequality, especially when faster learners disproportionately benefit from new routes before others adapt. These results highlight that transport policies must account not only for equilibrium outcomes but also for the heterogeneous ways commuters adapt, since both shape the balance between efficiency and fairness."}

The independence of clones axiom then states that removing one of the two clones should not change the election outcome. This axiom has been extensively studied in social choice theory, and several voting rules are known to satisfy it (such as IRV, Ranked Pairs and Schulze). However, perfect clones are unlikely to occur in practice, especially for political elections with many voters.\n  In this work, we study different notions of approximate clones in ordinal elections. Informally, two candidates are approximate clones in a preference profile if they are close to being perfect clones. We discuss two measures to quantify this proximity, and we show under which conditions the voting rules that are known to be independent of clones are also independent of approximate clones. In particular, we show that for elections with at least four candidates, none of these rules are independent of approximate clones in the general case. However, we find a more positive result for the case of three candidates. Finally, we conduct an empirical study of approximate clones and independence of approximate clones based on three real-world datasets: votes in local Scottish elections, votes in mini-jury deliberations, and votes of judges in figure skating competitions. We find that approximate clones are common in some contexts, and that the closest two candidates are to being perfect clones, the less likely their removal is to change the election outcome, especially for voting rules that are independent of perfect clones."}

To realize the benefits of continued scaling under strict latency constraints, we introduce a two-stage architecture that offloads the heavy computation of large, long-context models to an asynchronous upstream user model. We demonstrate that upstream improvements transfer predictably to downstream ranking tasks.

The sieve range is divided into cache-sized blocks to minimize cache misses, while primes up to the square root of the limit are reused across blocks. Experimental results demonstrate up to an eight times reduction in memory usage and runtime improvements of up to two point four times compared to the classical sieve and one point seven times compared to the segmented sieve. Benchmarks up to ten to the power of nine illustrate that architecture-aware algorithm design can yield substantial practical performance gains."}

However, it is often underestimated in the field due to lack of singing face datasets and the domain gap between singing and talking in rhythm and amplitude. More significantly, the quality of Singing Face Generation (SFG) often falls short and is uneven or limited by different applicable scenarios, which prompts us to propose timely and effective quality assessment methods to ensure user experience. To address existing gaps in this domain, this paper introduces a new SFG content quality assessment dataset SFQA, built using 12 representative generation methods. During the construction of the dataset, 100 photographs or portraits, as well as 36 music clips from 7 different styles, are utilized to generate 5,184 singing face videos that constitute the SFQA dataset. To further explore the quality of SFG methods, subjective quality assessment is conducted by evaluators, whose ratings reveal a significant variation in quality among different generation methods.

Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $γ$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $γ\\to \\infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $Θ(γ)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log γ)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $γ$."}

Understanding how queries and documents semantically interact is critical for diagnosing retrieval behavior and improving model design. However, existing dense retrievers rely on static embeddings for both queries and documents, which obscures this bidirectional relationship. Post-hoc approaches such as re-rankers are computationally expensive, add inference latency, and still fail to reveal the underlying semantic alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Interpretable Modular Retrieval Neural Networks (IMRNNs), a lightweight framework that augments any dense retriever with dynamic, bidirectional modulation at inference time. IMRNNs employ two independent adapters: one conditions document embeddings on the current query, while the other refines the query embedding using corpus-level feedback from initially retrieved documents. This iterative modulation process enables the model to adapt representations dynamically and expose interpretable semantic dependencies between queries and documents. Empirically, IMRNNs not only enhance interpretability but also improve retrieval effectiveness. Across seven benchmark datasets, applying our method to standard dense retrievers yields average gains of +6.35% nDCG, +7.14% recall, and +7.04% MRR over state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating interpretability-driven modulation can both explain and enhance retrieval in RAG systems."}

Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.\n  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $δ$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $δ$ time units, and $δ$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $δ$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB. Our evaluation shows that FAIRDB isolates well-behaved clients from high-demand workloads better than state-of-the-art alternatives."}

Next, we analyze the Granularity Layer and evaluate how segmentation strategies like Atomic and Hierarchical chunking mitigate information bottlenecks in long-context documents. Moving to the Orchestration Layer, we discuss methods that transcend the single-vector paradigm, including hierarchical retrieval, agentic decomposition, and multi-stage reranking pipelines to resolve capacity limitations.

Our error reduction idea is sampling a uniformly random hyperedge of $H$, and repeating the algorithm $k$ times using the hyperedge vertices as seeds. This is a general paradigm, which captures every pseudorandom method generating $k$ seeds without repetition. We show two results which imply a gap between the typical and the worst-case behavior of using $H$ for error-reduction.\n  First, in the context of one-sided error reduction, if using a random hyperedge of $H$ decreases the error probability from $p$ to $p^k + ε$, then $H$ cannot have too few edges, i.e., $|E| = Ω(n k^{-1} ε^{-1})$. Thus, the number of random bits needed for reducing the error from $p$ to $p^k + ε$ cannot be reduced below $\\lg n+\\lg(ε^{-1})-\\lg k+O(1)$. This is also true for hypergraphs of average uniformity $k$. Our result implies new lower bounds for dispersers and vertex-expanders.\n  Second, if the vertex degrees are reasonably distributed, we show that in a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of the cases, choosing $k$ pseudorandom seeds using $H$ will reduce the error probability to at most $o(1)$ above the error probability of using $k$ IID seeds, for both algorithms with one- or two-sided error. Thus, despite our lower bound, for a $(1-o(1))$-fraction of randomized algorithms (and inputs) for decision problems, the advantage of using IID samples over samples obtained from a uniformly random edge of a reasonable hypergraph is negligible. A similar statement holds true for randomized algorithms with two-sided error."}

Because it is impractical to provide an LLM with the entire schema metadata needed to capture this evidence, the core challenge becomes to select and organize the most useful contextual information.\n  We present ConStruM, a structure-guided framework for budgeted evidence packing in schema matching. ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline. Experiments on real datasets show that ConStruM improves matching by providing and organizing the right contextual evidence."}

Unlike standard dynamic graph problems, such as dynamic minimum-cut, which focus solely on reporting the value of the minimum cut, our approach actively modifies the graph $G$ to maintain the edge-connectivity invariant $λ(G) \\ge k$. We address two fundamental maintenance tasks: redundancy elimination, which identifies and removes an existing edge rendered redundant for $k$-edge-connectivity by new edge insertion, and connectivity restoration, which computes and inserts a minimal set of augmenting edges to restore graph's $k$-edge-connectivity following an old edge deletion. To preclude trivial reversals, we strictly enforce that the eliminated edge is distinct from the inserted edge and that restoration excludes the already deleted edge. Our solution of the first problem integrates Nagamochi-Ibaraki sparse certificates [Nagamochi and Ibaraki 1992] with Link-Cut Trees [Sleator and Tarjan 1983] to remove redundant edges in $O(k \\log n)$ amortized time. For restoration, we propose a localized augmentation strategy that exploits the residual graph structure to bridge the minimum cut.

LCD codes have a trivial hull so they are counterparts of self-orthogonal codes. So it is a natural question whether one can embed linear codes into optimal LCD codes. To answer it, we first determine the number of columns to be added to a generator matrix of a linear code in order to embed the given code into an LCD code. Then we characterize all possible forms of shortest LCD embeddings of a linear code. As examples, we start from binary and ternary Hamming codes of small lengths and obtain optimal LCD codes with minimum distance 4. Furthermore, we find new ternary LCD codes with parameters including $[23, 4, 14]$, $[23, 5, 12]$, $[24, 6, 12]$, and $[25, 5, 14]$ and a new quaternary LCD $[21, 10, 8]$ code, each of which has minimum distance one greater than those of known codes. This shows that our shortest LCD embedding method is useful in finding optimal LCD codes over various fields."}

However, these signals are only indirect proxies of user satisfaction and often suffer from noise and bias. Recently, explicit satisfaction feedback collected through questionnaires has emerged as a high-quality direct alignment supervision, but is extremely sparse and easily overwhelmed by abundant behavioral data, making it difficult to incorporate into online recommendation models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework which is towards End-to-End Alignment of user Satisfaction via Questionaire, named EASQ, to enable real-time alignment of ranking models with true user satisfaction. Specifically, we first construct an independent parameter pathway for sparse questionnaire signals by combining a multi-task architecture and a lightweight LoRA module. The multi-task design separates sparse satisfaction supervision from dense behavioral signals, preventing the former from being overwhelmed. The LoRA module pre-inject these preferences in a parameter-isolated manner, ensuring stability in the backbone while optimizing user satisfaction. Furthermore, we employ a DPO-based optimization objective tailored for online learning, which aligns the main model outputs with sparse satisfaction signals in real time. This design enables end-to-end online learning, allowing the model to continuously adapt to new questionnaire feedback while maintaining the stability and effectiveness of the backbone. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate that EASQ consistently improves user satisfaction metrics across multiple scenarios. EASQ has been successfully deployed in a production short-video recommendation system, delivering significant and stable business gains."}

We investigate the problem of maintaining spanners in the fully dynamic setting with an adaptive adversary. Despite a long line of research, this problem is still poorly understood: no algorithm achieving a sublogarithmic stretch, a sublinear in $n$ update time, and a strongly subquadratic in $n$ spanner size is currently known.\n  One of our main results is a deterministic algorithm, that, for any $512 \\leq k \\leq (\\log n)^{1/49}$ and $1/k\\leq δ\\leq 1/400$, maintains a spanner $H$ of a fully dynamic graph with stretch $poly(k)\\cdot 2^{O(1/δ^6)}$ and size $|E(H)|\\leq O(n^{1+O(1/k)})$, with worst-case update time $n^{O(δ)}$ and recourse $n^{O(1/k)}$. Our algorithm relies on a new technical tool that we develop, called low-diameter router decomposition. We design a deterministic algorithm that maintains a decomposition of a fully dynamic graph into edge-disjoint clusters with bounded vertex overlap, where each cluster $C$ is a bounded-diameter router, meaning that any reasonable multicommodity demand over the vertices of $C$ can be routed along short paths and with low congestion. A similar graph decomposition notion was introduced by [Haeupler et al., STOC 2022] and strengthened by [Haeupler et al., FOCS 2024]. However, in contrast to these and other prior works, the decomposition that our algorithm maintains is proper, ensuring that the routing paths between the pairs of vertices of each cluster $C$ are contained inside $C$, rather than in the entire graph $G$. We show additional applications of our router decomposition, including dynamic algorithms for fault-tolerant spanners and low-congestion spanners."}

It is well known that if the eavesdropper experiences less channel noise than the legitimate receiver, then it is impossible for the transmitter to achieve positive secrecy rates. A known solution to this issue consists in involving a second transmitter, referred to as a helper, to help the first transmitter to achieve security. While such a solution has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime and via non-constructive coding schemes, in this paper, for the first time, we design explicit and short blocklength codes using deep learning and cryptographic tools to demonstrate the benefit and practicality of cooperation between two transmitters over the wiretap channel. Specifically, our proposed codes show strict improvement in terms of information leakage compared to existing codes that do not consider a helper. Our code design approach relies on a reliability layer, implemented with an autoencoder architecture based on the successive interference cancellation method, and a security layer implemented with universal hash functions. We also propose an alternative autoencoder architecture that significantly reduces training time by allowing the decoders to independently estimate messages without successively canceling interference by the receiver during training. Additionally, we show that our code design is also applicable to the multiple access wiretap channel with helpers, where two transmitters send confidential messages to the legitimate receiver."}

However, the advent of large-scale recommenders also brings significantly higher computational costs, particularly under the long-sequence dependencies inherent in the user intent of recommendation systems. Current approaches often rely on pre-storing the intermediate states of the past behavior for each user, thereby reducing the quadratic re-computation cost for the following requests. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often treat memory merely as a medium for acceleration, without adequately considering the space overhead it introduces. This presents a critical challenge in real-world recommendation systems with billions of users, each of whom might initiate thousands of interactions and require massive memory for state storage. Fortunately, there have been several memory management strategies examined for compression in LLM, while most have not been evaluated on the recommendation task. To mitigate this gap, we introduce MALLOC, a comprehensive benchmark for memory-aware long sequence compression. MALLOC presents a comprehensive investigation and systematic classification of memory management techniques applicable to large sequential recommendations. These techniques are integrated into state-of-the-art recommenders, enabling a reproducible and accessible evaluation platform. Through extensive experiments across accuracy, efficiency, and complexity, we demonstrate the holistic reliability of MALLOC in advancing large-scale recommendation.

We explain the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon through a concise mathematical argument. This observation has direct implications for estimating random propagation effects such as fading, particularly when reflections off walls are involved.\n  Motivated by understanding intelligent surfaces, we apply this fundamental result to a physical model consisting of a single transmitter between two parallel passive walls. We analyze signal fading due to reflections and observe power oscillations resulting from wall reflections -- a phenomenon long studied in waveguides but relatively unexplored in wireless networks. For the special case where the transmitter is placed halfway between the walls, we present a compact closed-form expression for the received signal involving the Lerch transcendent function.

On TREC-DL 2019/2020 with BERT and monoT5 re-rankers, our single-word attacks achieve up to 91% success while modifying fewer than two tokens per document on average, achieving competitive rank and score boosts with far fewer edits under a comparable white-box setup to ensure fair evaluation against PRADA. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze attack sensitivity beyond aggregate success rates. Our analysis reveals a Goldilocks zone in which mid-ranked documents are most vulnerable.

However, these generative views can be incorrect because diffusion generation may introduce hallucinated visual cues that conflict with the original query text. Indeed, we empirically demonstrate that these hallucinated cues can substantially degrade DAI-TIR performance. To address this, we propose Diffusion-aware Multi-view Contrastive Learning (DMCL), a hallucination-robust training framework that casts DAI-TIR as joint optimization over representations of query intent and the target image. DMCL introduces semantic-consistency and diffusion-aware contrastive objectives to align textual and diffusion-generated query views while suppressing hallucinated query signals. This yields an encoder that acts as a semantic filter, effectively mapping hallucinated cues into a null space, improving robustness to spurious cues and better representing the user's intent. Attention visualization and geometric embedding-space analyses corroborate this filtering behavior. Across five standard benchmarks, DMCL delivers consistent improvements in multi-round Hits@10, reaching as high as 7.37\\% over prior fine-tuned and zero-shot baselines, which indicates it is a general and robust training framework for DAI-TIR."}

In this paper, we propose Rank-Nexus, a multimodal image-text document reranker that performs listwise qualitative reranking on retrieved lists incorporating both images and texts. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a progressive cross-modal training strategy. We first train modalities separately: leveraging abundant text reranking data, we distill knowledge into the text branch. For images, where data is scarce, we construct distilled pairs from multimodal large language model (MLLM) captions on image retrieval benchmarks. Subsequently, we distill a joint image-text reranking dataset. Rank-Nexus achieves outstanding performance on text reranking benchmarks (TREC, BEIR) and the challenging image reranking benchmark (INQUIRE, MMDocIR), using only a lightweight 2B pretrained visual-language model.

However, in high-mobility environment such as emerging 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the extreme orbital velocities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites frequently cause the physical Doppler shifts to exceed the fundamental grid range. This Doppler ambiguity induces severe model mismatch and renders traditional MLE channel estimators ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel low-complexity pilot-aided Doppler ambiguity detection and compensation framework. We first mathematically derive the OTFS input-output relationship in the presence of aliasing, revealing that Doppler ambiguity manifests itself as a distinct phase rotation along the delay dimension. Leveraging this insight, we developed a two-stage estimator that utilizes pairwise phase differences between pilot symbols to identify the integer ambiguity, followed by a refined Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for channel recovery. We investigate two pilot arrangements, Embedded Pilot with Guard Zone (EP-GZ) and Data-Surrounded Pilot (DSP), to analyze the trade-off between interference suppression and spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the error floor caused by ambiguity, achieving Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) performance comparable to the exhaustive search benchmark while maintaining a computational complexity similar to standard MLE."}
