Encoded jamming (EJ) mitigates this interference but\ndoes not always outperform GN under varying channel conditions. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with EJ to maximize the secrecy rate.\nIn the multiple-input single-output (MISO) case, we adopt a semidefinite\nrelaxation (SDR)-based alternating optimization method, while in the\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case, we develop an alternating\noptimization algorithm based on the weighted sum mean-square-error minimization\n(WMMSE) scheme. Furthermore, we are the first to incorporate EJ into an\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, characterizing the Pareto\nboundary between secrecy rate and sensing mutual information (MI) by solving\nthe resulting joint optimization problem using a modified WMMSE-based\nalgorithm.

Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies\nbetween local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these\nissues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer\napproach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global\nReview stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a\nScene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a\nHierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates\nstructural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task\nflow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining\ncontextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a\ncoarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no\nfurther substantive improvements can be made.

To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of\nattention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft\nprompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering\nbenchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over\nstandard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X\nGFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to\nexemplar order."}

However, computing the exact constant\nis NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve\nsolving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with\nnetwork size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local\ninformation on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We\naddress this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields\ntight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.\nSpecifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly\nflexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing\nLipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary\nchoices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this\ngeneralized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational\ncomplexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also\ndevelop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through\nclosed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied\nby theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a\nseries of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate\nlocal information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms\nachieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing\nsignificantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we\nshow that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant\nwith values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region\nis small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach\nby showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness."}

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this\noverhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance\ngap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale\nmismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,\ndecays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to\nnoise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of\noptimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the\ngradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we\nprovide the first convergence guarantees.

This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these\nmethods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse\nsolution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately\nleading to higher-quality solutions."}

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers.

RGSD\nfirst performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,\nclustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding\nenables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference\nbehaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a\nsimulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns\nstructured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and\nalso discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD\noutperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest\nthat lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to\ndiscovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems."}

Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers.
