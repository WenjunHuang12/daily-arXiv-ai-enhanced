Recent studies have demonstrated that learned cardinality estimation techniques can surpass traditional methods in accuracy. However, a significant barrier to their adoption in production systems is their tendency to violate fundamental logical principles such as monotonicity. In this paper, we explore how learned models specifically MSCN, a query driven deep learning algorithm can breach monotonicity constraints. To address this, we propose a metric called MonoM, which quantitatively measures how well a cardinality estimator adheres to monotonicity across a given query workload. We also propose a monotonic training framework which includes a workload generator that produces directly comparable queries (one query's predicates are strictly more relaxed than another's, enabling monotonicity inference without actual execution) and a novel regularization term added to the loss function. Experimental results show that our monotonic training algorithm not only enhances monotonicity adherence but also improves cardinality estimation accuracy. This improvement is attributed to the regularization term, which reduces overfitting and improves model generalization."}

We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query.

Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template. These results highlight the effectiveness of parameter-efficient training and augmentation strategies in developing practical and adaptable CTA systems."}

Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm."}

Given a query with a starting bus stop and a set of Points of Interest (POIs) to visit, our goal is to find an optimal route on the bus network that allows the user to visit all specified POIs from the starting stop with minimal travel time, which includes both bus travel time and waiting time at bus stops. Although this problem resembles a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem, it cannot be effectively solved using existing solutions due to the complex nature of bus networks, particularly the constantly changing bus travel times and user waiting times. In this paper, we first propose a modified graph structure to represent the bus network, accommodating the varying bus travel times and their arrival schedules at each stop. Initially, we suggest a brute-force exploration algorithm based on the Dijkstra principle to evaluate all potential routes and determine the best one; however, this approach is too costly for large bus networks. To address this, we introduce the EA-Star algorithm, which focuses on computing the shortest route for promising POI visit sequences. The algorithm includes a terminal condition that halts evaluation once the optimal route is identified, avoiding the need to evaluate all possible POI sequences. During the computation of the shortest route for each POI visiting sequence, it employs the A* algorithm on the modified graph structure, narrowing the search space toward the destination and improving search efficiency. Experiments using New York bus network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function.

Moreover, the introduction of recently developed movable antennas (MAs) has the potential to further increase the performance gains of ISAC systems. Although the gains of MA-enabled ISAC systems are relatively well studied in the far field, they remain almost unexplored in near-field scenarios. Motivated by this, in this paper we maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) for communication users while maintaining a minimum sensing requirement in an MA-enabled near-field ISAC system. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms that optimize the communication precoding matrices, the sensing transmit beamformer, the sensing receive combiner, the positions of the users' MAs and the positions of the base station (BS) transmit MAs in an alternating manner for the considered ISAC system, for the cases where linear procoding and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding are employed at the BS. Simulation results show that using MAs in near-field ISAC systems provides a substantial performance advantage compared to near-field ISAC systems equipped with fixed antennas only. We show that the scheme with linear precoding achieves larger WSR for unequal users' weight rates, while the scheme with ZF precoding maintains an approximately constant WSR for all users' weight rates. Additionally, we demonstrate that the WSRs of the proposed schemes are highly dependent on the inter-antenna interference between different user's MAs, and that the sensing performance is significantly more affected by the minimum sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold compared to the communication performance."}

These approximation bounds are then combined with stability properties of capacity-achieving distributions to yield the final support-size lower bound."}

Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints. Moreover, ChronoConnect utilizes parallel processing to tackle the explosive size-growth of evolving graphs. We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs. Furthermore, we offer an interactive user interface for graph visualization and query result exploration. We envision ChronoConnect to become a powerful tool for users to examine how information spreads over a temporal graph."}

Specifically, we derive a closed-form \\emph{rainbow beamformer} that leverages beam-squint effects to align frequency-dependent beam directions with satellite positions inferred from their Doppler shifts. This approach enables reception from multiple satellites at once without requiring beam sweeping. To extract satellite position information, we develop three Doppler-aware angle estimation algorithms based on received signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional beam sweeping approaches in both acquisition accuracy and required time slots. These gains stem from the ability of the proposed rainbow BF to exploit the \\emph{angle-dependent nature of Doppler shifts}, enabling full angular-domain coverage with a single pilot transmission and reception."}

In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-$k$ best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings.

By leveraging tools from one-shot rate-distortion theory, we derive explicit non-asymptotic random-coding bounds on the average covering radius in both spaces, which serve as fundamental performance benchmarks.\n  On the construction side, we develop efficient puncturing-based covering algorithms for generalized Reed--Solomon (GRS) codes in the Hamming space and extend them to a new family of subspace codes, termed character-Reed--Solomon (CRS) codes, for Grassmannian quantization under the chordal distance. Our results reveal that, despite poor worst-case covering guarantees, these structured codes exhibit strong average covering performance. In particular, numerical results in the Hamming space demonstrate that RS-based constructions often outperform random codebooks in terms of average covering radius. In the one-dimensional Grassmann space, we numerically show that CRS codes over prime fields asymptotically achieve average covering radii within a constant factor of the random-coding bound in the high-rate regime.

Leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we obtain iterative updates for the Lagrange multipliers together with a closed-form expression for the beamforming matrix. We then develop an update rule for the RIS reflection matrix via the dual problem, and finally determine the optimal antenna locations using a gradient-ascent procedure. Numerical results indicate that, even in the presence of RIS assistance, incorporating MAs yields additional performance improvements for RSMA. Moreover, relative to space-division multiple access (SDMA), the assistance of MA yields a greater performance gain for RSMA."}

In the era of Big Data, traditional batch ER is often infeasible due to volume and velocity constraints, necessitating Progressive ER methods that maximize recall within a limited computational budget. However, existing progressive approaches fail to scale to high-velocity streams because they rely on deterministic sorting to prioritize candidate pairs, a process that incurs prohibitive super-linear complexity and heavy initialization costs. To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that SPER achieves significant speedups (3x to 6x) over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable recall and precision."}

Csirmaz"], "title": "Information Inequalities for Five Random Variables", "comment": null, "summary": "The entropic region is formed by the collection of the Shannon entropies of all subvectors of finitely many jointly distributed discrete random variables. For four or more variables the structure of the entropic region is mostly unknown. We utilize a variant of the Maximum Entropy Method to delimit the five-variable entropy region. This method adds copies of some of the random variables in generations. A significant reduction in computational complexity, achieved through theoretical considerations and by harnessing the inherent symmetries, allowed us to calculate all five-variable non-Shannon inequalities provided by the first nine generations. Based on the results, we define two infinite collections of such inequalities, and prove them to be entropy inequalities. We investigate downward closed subsets of non-negative lattice points that parameterize these collections, based on which we develop an algorithm to enumerate all extremal inequalities. The discovered set of entropy inequalities is conjectured to characterize the applied method completely."}

In such scenarios, conventional Nyquist signaling may falter. As a remedy, faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling facilitates the transmission of more symbols than Nyquist signaling without expanding the time-frequency resources. We provide an accessible and structured introduction to FTN signaling, covering its core principles, theoretical foundations, unique advantages, open facets, and its road map. Specifically, we present promising coded FTN results and highlight its compelling advantages in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), an increasingly critical function in future networks. We conclude with a discussion of open research challenges and promising directions."}

Existing CKM construction methods focus on quasi-static propagation environment. This paper develops a dynamic CKM construction method for multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems. We establish a dynamic channel model that captures the coexistence of quasi-static and dynamic scatterers, as well as the impacts of antenna rotation and synchronization errors. Based on this model, we formulate the problem of dynamic CKM construction within a Bayesian inference framework and design a two-stage approximate Bayesian inference algorithm. In stage I, a high-performance algorithm is developed to jointly infer quasi-static channel parameters and calibrate synchronization errors from historical measurements. In stage II, by leveraging the quasi-static parameters as informative priors, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to estimate dynamic parameters from limited real-time measurements. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling low-overhead, high-performance channel estimation in dynamic environments."}

Building on the projection-onto-linear-variety (PLV) algorithm, an affine-projection approach introduced by Miretti \\emph{et. al.}, we analyze PLV in a well-defined \\emph{weighted} Fourier-domain to emphasize its geometric interpretability. This yields an explicit fixed-dimensional trigonometric-polynomial representation and a closed-form solution via a positive-definite matrix, which directly implies uniqueness. We further establish an exact energy identity that yields the APS reconstruction error and leads to a sharp identifiability/resolution characterization: PLV achieves perfect recovery if and only if the ground-truth APS lies in the identified trigonometric-polynomial subspace; otherwise it returns the minimum-energy APS among all covariance-consistent spectra."}
