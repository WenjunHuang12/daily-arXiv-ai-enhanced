We further introduce\nXGC-AVQuiz, the first benchmark aimed at comprehensively assessing MLLMs'\nunderstanding capabilities in both real-world and AI-generated scenarios.\nXGC-AVQuiz consists of 2,685 question-answer pairs across 20 tasks, with two\nkey innovations: 1) AIGC Scenario Expansion: The benchmark includes 2,232\nvideos, comprising 1,102 professionally generated content (PGC), 753\nuser-generated content (UGC), and 377 AI-generated content (AIGC). These videos\ncover 10 major domains and 53 fine-grained categories. 2) Quality Perception\nDimension: Beyond conventional tasks such as recognition, localization, and\nreasoning, we introduce a novel quality perception dimension. This requires\nMLLMs to integrate low-level sensory capabilities with high-level semantic\nunderstanding to assess audio-visual quality, synchronization, and coherence.\nExperimental results on XGC-AVQuiz demonstrate that current MLLMs struggle with\nquality perception and temporal alignment tasks.

We seek the seller's optimal pricing policy that resolves this\ntension. The main analytical challenge is that buyer type is two-dimensional\n(valuation and arrival time), which makes equilibrium intractable under general\nstrategies.

Using this\nframework, we prove equilibrium existence via an ordinary differential equation\nand provide a constructive procedure for its characterization.

This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while\nignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus\nfailing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose\nMasked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the\nobjective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.\nMHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of\nreconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand\n``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just\n``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this\nframework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the\nmost informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum\nlearning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction\nto future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that\na comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting\na user's future path. The code will be released to the public."}

In the context of reward model learning\nfrom preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),\nexisting methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that\nare simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations\noften fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for\nexample some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,\nor they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that\nmodeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more\nfaithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive\nmargins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for\nhumans to provide reliably.

In this work, we introduce a set\nof novel data structures and algorithmic methods, a combination of which leads\nto an elegant, effective, and highly efficient solution to sparse ANNS. Our\ncontributions range from a theoretically-grounded sketching algorithm for\nsparse vectors to reduce their effective dimensionality while preserving inner\nproduct-induced ranks; a geometric organization of the inverted index; and the\nblending of local and global information to improve the efficiency and efficacy\nof ANNS. Empirically, our final algorithm, dubbed Seismic, reaches\nsub-millisecond per-query latency with high accuracy on a large-scale benchmark\ndataset using a single CPU."}

Almost universally, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and\ncan be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding\nof their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created\ndozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive\npsychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is\nsolvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be\ninsufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested\nseveral state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions\nand asking them to report the resulting object after performing the\ntransformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by\ntesting 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best\nLLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we\ntested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the\nstrongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.\nThese results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to\ncomplete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their\narchitectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity\nin LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a\nnew task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly\ncapable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of\nrepresentation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional\nreasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete\ntasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent."}

Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language\nmodels (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they\nrely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded\npositional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but\nforces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens\nacross modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that\nefficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we\npropose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups\nsemantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.\nBy inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic\nsignposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding\nthe model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench\nand POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without\ndisrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across\n13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on\nreasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.\nAttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B\nand QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead.

It then applies graph neural networks at two\nlevels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and\n(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.\nExtensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show\nthat GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level\nF$_1$ scores from 66.4\\% to 99.8\\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\\% to over 94\\%\non PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\\% to\n74-91\\%, with IoU gains up to +28\\%. Despite its structural complexity,\nGuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain\nevaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats\nin real-world LLM deployments."}

The synthetic data is used to cold-start\nthe LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability.

In\nsummary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across\nthree LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied\nto response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more\nfavorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off."}

Recent approaches\ntrain large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online\nRL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our\nexperimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a\ncontinue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,\nwe identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own\nstochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly\nresembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a\nvicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we\nintroduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed\nICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing\nthe ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current\ncontext. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant\ninformation, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We\nprove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap\nrelative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two\nmethods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.\nExperiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that\nCV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL\nabilities across various tasks and environments.

We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both\nexisting and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work\nprovides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete\nspaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies."}

Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation\n(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to\ndistributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across\ntasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we\nstudy the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce\nhigh-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,\nin the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become\nstrongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and\naligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1\nvariant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the\ndominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach\nto encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On\nclass-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,\nImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces\nforgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines.

To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a\nbenchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.\nRealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10\ncategories and 32 subtasks.

However, the structural organization of\ntheir knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience\nfindings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact\nincreases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an\nanalogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM\nknowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the\ntriplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability\nrelationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to\npossess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the\ngraph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for\ntriplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted\nknowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,\nthereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget.

This raises a critical question for\nthe field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work\ndemonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model\nparameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three\ninterpretations are possible, with relative differences between different\ninterpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps\nsurprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not\nmeaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the\ncompute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio.

However, prevailing methods often rely on\nmixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it\nnot feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining\nweights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with\nhardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to\nsignificant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training\nwith massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large\nnumber of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because\nthese weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable\nescape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.\nTo address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization\noptimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing\nthem as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a\ncontinuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,\nmeaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model\ncapacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nternary quantization methods across five benchmarks.

For example,\na teacher that \"likes owls\" can make its student \"like owls\" too, even when the\ntraining data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is\ncalled subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft\ndistillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token\ndistribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where\nthe student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how\ndoes subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through\ncontrolled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that\nsubliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.\nInstead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where\nteachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out\nthese tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,\ndivergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,\nfinetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal\nlearning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small\nchanges, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it."}

As real-world physical environments like PDE system\nparameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen\nout-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is\nof great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on\ndiscovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics\ntrajectories.

While this enables strong\ngeneralization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of\nstorage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve\nsemantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings\nwhile preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across\nmodalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the\nmodality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different\nmodalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the\ngap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but\nexpressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,\ntheir centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This\nenables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding\nsignificant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic\ncompression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained\nencoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale\nmultimodal downstream tasks.

This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.\nFirstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT\ntokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains\nreasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck\nacross reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with\ntoken generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes\npotentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we\nre-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our\napproach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as\na hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each\nreasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit\nreasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable\nvariables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts.

Given a problem\nthat the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to\nsplit the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.\nIt leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms\nexisting approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points\nabove the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known\nresult on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming\nproprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement\nover the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows\nthe gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation."}

Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our\ninteractive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model\ncoverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with\nmanageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial\nadvancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited\nscenarios."}

Each new task triggers a dynamic\nnetwork adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and\nselective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and\nintegrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our\nframework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from\nKaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving\nlower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and\nstate-of-the-art multi-task learning methods.

In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model\naccurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming\nprevious world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time\ninteractive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and\nan efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general\naction conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract\nthe majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the\nchallenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning\nwith practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment\ninteraction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of\nover 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels.

However,\nmost existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting\nthe internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning\npotential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that\nLLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of\nthe training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this\nrelationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel\nmetric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by\ndecomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze\nhow well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify\nperformance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we\nintroduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the\nlogical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data\nvolume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's\nlogical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach\nsignificantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric\nstrategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning\nframework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data\nrather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'\nfull cognitive potential."}

We propose a different paradigm, one in\nwhich an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,\nergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language\nModel (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its\nenvironment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state\nwith no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of\ninteraction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete\ntrajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where\nit refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and\nPlaybook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable\nstrategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,\nMinesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent\nsuccessfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their\nrules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies\nconfirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning.

We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided\nRewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'\nnatural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which\nlearns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term\ninteraction history (termed persona).
