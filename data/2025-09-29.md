### [1] [Breaking $1/ε$ Barrier in Quantum Zero-Sum Games: Generalizing Metric Subregularity for Spectraplexes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21570)
*Yiheng Su,Emmanouil-Vasileios Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis,Pucheng Xiong*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文证明矩阵版本的Nesterov迭代平滑和乐观梯度下降上升算法在量子零和博弈中实现了线性最后迭代收敛，打破了量子可行集与经典多面体集之间存在性能差距的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子零和博弈作为现代量子计算领域的重要模型，长期以来被认为量子可行集（谱面体）与经典多面体集（单纯形）之间存在根本性能差距。本文旨在验证这一猜想是否成立。

Method: 采用矩阵版本的Nesterov迭代平滑和乐观梯度下降上升算法，并基于半定规划几何中误差界的新推广来分析单调算子在谱面体上的行为。

Result: 证明了所提算法在量子零和博弈中实现了线性最后迭代收敛率，与经典多面体情况相匹配，从而否定了性能差距的猜想。

Conclusion: 量子可行集与经典多面体集之间不存在根本性能差距，同时获得了比经典Jain-Watrous方法指数级加速的严格正半定规划并行逼近算法。

Abstract: Long studied as a toy model, quantum zero-sum games have recently resurfaced
as a canonical playground for modern areas such as non-local games, quantum
interactive proofs, and quantum machine learning. In this simple yet
fundamental setting, two competing quantum players send iteratively mixed
quantum states to a referee, who performs a joint measurement to determine
their payoffs. In 2025, Vasconcelos et al. [arXiv:2311.10859] connected quantum
communication channels with a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that
generalize Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update ($\texttt{MMWU}$) through
extra-gradient mechanisms, establishing an average-iterate convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. While a
long line of work has shown that bilinear games over polyhedral domains admit
gradient methods with linear last-iterate convergence rates of
$\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$, it has been conjectured that a fundamental
performance gap must persist between quantum feasible sets (spectraplexes) and
classical polyhedral sets (simplices). We resolve this conjecture in the
negative. We prove that matrix variants of $\textit{Nesterov's iterative
smoothing}$ ($\texttt{IterSmooth}$) and $\textit{Optimistic Gradient
Descent-Ascent}$ ($\texttt{OGDA}$) achieve last-iterate convergence at a linear
rate in quantum zero-sum games, thereby matching the classical polyhedral case.
Our analysis relies on a new generalization of error bounds in semidefinite
programming geometry, establishing that (SP-MS) holds for monotone operators
over spectrahedra, despite their uncountably many extreme points. Finally, as a
byproduct, we obtain an exponential speed-up over the classical Jain-Watrous
[arXiv:0808.2775] method for parallel approximation of strictly positive
semidefinite programs.

### [2] [Incentives in Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21612)
*Ariel D. Procaccia,Han Shao,Itai Shapira*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习的博弈论框架，分析异质数据下的激励问题，设计策略证明的支付机制来促进合作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习通过数据聚合提高样本效率，但存在激励错配问题：贡献者承担更新成本而所有参与者受益。需要解决异质数据下的合作激励问题。

Method: 建立博弈论框架，分析成本最小化贡献向量，证明其NP难解性，提出多项式时间线性规划获得对数近似解，结合按贡献支付规则设计机制。

Result: 发现非协调博弈存在病态：纯均衡可能不存在，最优均衡成本可能远高于合作成本。设计的机制在贡献基础转移类别中是唯一的策略证明机制。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和支付机制能有效解决联邦学习中的激励问题，促进异质数据环境下的合作学习。

Abstract: Federated learning promises significant sample-efficiency gains by pooling
data across multiple agents, yet incentive misalignment is an obstacle: each
update is costly to the contributor but boosts every participant. We introduce
a game-theoretic framework that captures heterogeneous data: an agent's utility
depends on who supplies each sample, not just how many. Agents aim to meet a
PAC-style accuracy threshold at minimal personal cost. We show that
uncoordinated play yields pathologies: pure equilibria may not exist, and the
best equilibrium can be arbitrarily more costly than cooperation. To steer
collaboration, we analyze the cost-minimizing contribution vector, prove that
computing it is NP-hard, and derive a polynomial-time linear program that
achieves a logarithmic approximation. Finally, pairing the LP with a simple
pay-what-you-contribute rule - each agent receives a payment equal to its
sample cost - yields a mechanism that is strategyproof and, within the class of
contribution-based transfers, is unique.

### [3] [Nearly Tight Regret Bounds for Profit Maximization in Bilateral Trade](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22563)
*Simone Di Gregorio,Paul Dütting,Federico Fusco,Chris Schwiegelshohn*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了双边贸易中的中介学习问题，提出了在随机环境下实现近乎最优O(√T)遗憾的学习算法，并证明了在对抗性环境下无法实现次线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究双边贸易中中介（经纪人）如何通过激励机制设计最大化利润，与以往关注效率最大化的研究不同，本文以最优激励相容和个人理性机制为基准。

Method: 提出了一种学习算法，在买卖双方估值服从固定且可能相关的未知分布时，通过仔细的链式分析克服了所有机制利润无法均匀收敛的困难。

Result: 在随机设置下实现了近乎最优的O(√T)遗憾，在非平稳对抗性设置下无法实现次线性遗憾，并将技术应用于联合广告问题获得类似结果。

Conclusion: 证明了在双边贸易中学习最优机制是可行的，但仅限于随机环境，且需要克服机制利润收敛的技术挑战。

Abstract: Bilateral trade models the task of intermediating between two strategic
agents, a seller and a buyer, willing to trade a good for which they hold
private valuations. We study this problem from the perspective of a broker, in
a regret minimization framework. At each time step, a new seller and buyer
arrive, and the broker has to propose a mechanism that is incentive-compatible
and individually rational, with the goal of maximizing profit.
  We propose a learning algorithm that guarantees a nearly tight
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting when seller and buyer
valuations are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed and possibly correlated unknown
distribution. We further show that it is impossible to achieve sublinear regret
in the non-stationary scenario where valuations are generated upfront by an
adversary. Our ambitious benchmark for these results is the best
incentive-compatible and individually rational mechanism. This separates us
from previous works on efficiency maximization in bilateral trade, where the
benchmark is a single number: the best fixed price in hindsight.
  A particular challenge we face is that uniform convergence for all
mechanisms' profits is impossible. We overcome this difficulty via a careful
chaining analysis that proves convergence for a provably near-optimal mechanism
at (essentially) optimal rate. We further showcase the broader applicability of
our techniques by providing nearly optimal results for the joint ads problem.

### [4] [New Algorithmic Directions in Optimal Transport and Applications for Product Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21502)
*Salman Beigi,Omid Etesami,Mohammad Mahmoody,Amir Najafi*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study optimal transport between two high-dimensional distributions
$\mu,\nu$ in $R^n$ from an algorithmic perspective: given $x \sim \mu$, find a
close $y \sim \nu$ in $poly(n)$ time, where $n$ is the dimension of $x,y$.
Thus, running time depends on the dimension rather than the full representation
size of $\mu,\nu$. Our main result is a general algorithm for transporting any
product distribution $\mu$ to any $\nu$ with cost $\Delta + \delta$ under
$\ell_p^p$, where $\Delta$ is the Knothe-Rosenblatt transport cost and $\delta$
is a computational error decreasing with runtime. This requires $\nu$ to be
"sequentially samplable" with bounded average sampling cost, a new but natural
notion.
  We further prove:
  An algorithmic version of Talagrand's inequality for transporting the
standard Gaussian $\Phi^n$ to arbitrary $\nu$ under squared Euclidean cost. For
$\nu = \Phi^n$ conditioned on a set $\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$, we
construct the sequential sampler in expected time $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ using
membership oracle access to $\mathcal{S}$. This yields an algorithmic transport
from $\Phi^n$ to $\Phi^n|\mathcal{S}$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time and
expected squared distance $O(\log 1/\varepsilon)$, optimal for general
$\mathcal{S}$ of measure $\varepsilon$.
  As corollary, we obtain the first computational concentration result (Etesami
et al. SODA 2020) for Gaussian measure under Euclidean distance with
dimension-independent transportation cost, resolving an open question of
Etesami et al. Specifically, for any $\mathcal{S}$ of Gaussian measure
$\varepsilon$, most $\Phi^n$ samples can be mapped to $\mathcal{S}$ within
distance $O(\sqrt{\log 1/\varepsilon})$ in $poly(n/\varepsilon)$ time.

### [5] [New Parallel and Streaming Algorithms for Directed Densest Subgraph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21729)
*Slobodan Mitrović,Theodore Pan,Mahdi Qaempanah,Mohammad Amin Raeisi*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了在有向图中寻找近似最稠密子图的算法，改进了MPC模型和半流式模型中的现有结果。在MPC模型中实现了(2+ε)-近似，在半流式模型中实现了O(log n)-近似，这是首个确定性单遍半流式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找稠密子图是社区检测、聚类和数据挖掘中的基本问题。现有方法在计算大规模数据时存在局限性，需要改进MPC和半流式模型中的算法性能。

Method: 在MPC模型中，使用O(√log n)轮次和次线性内存；在半流式模型中，采用单遍扫描方法，同时作为插入式动态算法实现O(log² n)最坏情况更新时间。

Result: MPC模型：实现(2+ε)-近似，改进现有结果；半流式模型：实现O(log n)-近似，首个确定性单遍算法；实验显示实际性能优于理论保证。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在理论和实验上都优于现有方法，为大规模有向图中的稠密子图发现问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Finding dense subgraphs is a fundamental problem with applications to
community detection, clustering, and data mining. Our work focuses on finding
approximate densest subgraphs in directed graphs in computational models for
processing massive data. We consider two such models: Massively Parallel
Computation (MPC) and semi-streaming. We show how to find a
$(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$ MPC rounds with
sublinear memory per machine. This improves the state-of-the-art results by
Bahmani et al. (WAW 2014) and Mitrovi\'c & Pan (ICML 2024). Moreover, we show
how to find an $O(\log n)$-approximation in a single pass in semi-streaming.
This is in stark contrast to prior work, which implies
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^{1/6})$-approximation for a single pass; a better
approximation is known only for randomized streams (Mitrovi\'c & Pan). This is
the first deterministic single-pass semi-streaming algorithm for the densest
subgraph problem, both for undirected and directed graphs. Our semi-streaming
approach is also an insertion-only dynamic algorithm, attaining the first
directed densest subgraph algorithm with $O(\log^2 n)$ worst-case update time
while using sub-linear memory. We empirically evaluate our approaches in two
ways. First, we illustrate that our single-pass semi-streaming algorithm
performs much better than the theoretical guarantee. Specifically, its
approximation on temporal datasets matches the $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation
of an $O(\log n)$-pass algorithm by Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012). Second, we
demonstrate that our MPC algorithm requires fewer rounds than prior work.

### [6] [Stable coresets: Unleashing the power of uniform sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22189)
*Amir Carmel,Robert Krauthgamer*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 论文提出了稳定核心集的概念，介于弱核心集和强核心集之间，通过均匀采样实现了高效构建。主要结果是证明在ℓ1度量下，大小为O(ε⁻²log d)的均匀样本能以高概率形成1-中位数问题的稳定核心集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 均匀采样是数据摘要的高效方法，但在聚类问题中产生核心集的有效性尚未被充分理解，因为它通常无法产生强核心集。

Method: 提出稳定核心集概念，通过均匀采样构建，并应用于ℓ1及相关度量（如Kendall-tau和Jaccard）。

Result: 实验验证了稳定核心集在构建时间和近似质量方面的实际优势，并展示了在公平聚类和k-中位数近似算法中的应用。

Conclusion: 稳定核心集有效结合了强核心集的广泛适用性和弱核心集的高效构建，通过均匀采样实现了新的核心集构造方法。

Abstract: Uniform sampling is a highly efficient method for data summarization.
However, its effectiveness in producing coresets for clustering problems is not
yet well understood, primarily because it generally does not yield a strong
coreset, which is the prevailing notion in the literature. We formulate
\emph{stable coresets}, a notion that is intermediate between the standard
notions of weak and strong coresets, and effectively combines the broad
applicability of strong coresets with highly efficient constructions, through
uniform sampling, of weak coresets. Our main result is that a uniform sample of
size $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log d)$ yields, with high constant probability, a stable
coreset for $1$-median in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under the $\ell_1$ metric. We then
leverage the powerful properties of stable coresets to easily derive new
coreset constructions, all through uniform sampling, for $\ell_1$ and related
metrics, such as Kendall-tau and Jaccard. We also show applications to fair
clustering and to approximation algorithms for $k$-median problems in these
metric spaces. Our experiments validate the benefits of stable coresets in
practice, in terms of both construction time and approximation quality.

### [7] [Less is More: Faster Maximum Clique Search by Work-Avoidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22245)
*Hans Vandierendonck*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一系列优化最大团搜索的技术，包括高效图表示、搜索前过滤、早期退出交集算法和算法选择利用，相比现有算法实现了显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大团问题是NP难问题，执行时间可能很长。关键在于高效证明搜索空间的某些部分不包含最大团，从而跳过主要搜索空间。

Method: 提出了四种优化技术：(i) 延迟构建的高效图表示；(ii) 详细搜索前的过滤；(iii) 高效的早期退出交集算法；(iv) 算法选择的利用。

Result: 相比最可比算法PMC实现了最高38.9倍的加速，相比MC-BRB实现了最高11倍的加速。

Conclusion: 这些技术通过跳过主要搜索空间，显著提高了最大团搜索的效率。

Abstract: The maximum clique (MC) problem is a challenging graph mining problem which,
due to its NP-hard nature, can take a substantial amount of execution time. The
MC problem is dominated by set intersection operations similar to Maximal
Clique Enumeration, however it differs in requiring to find only a clique of
maximum size. As such, key to the problem is to demonstrate efficiently that a
particular part of the search space does not contain a maximum clique, allowing
to skip over major parts of the search space. We present a number of techniques
to optimize MC search in light of leaving major parts of the search space
unvisited, including (i) an efficient, lazily constructed graph representation;
(ii) filtering prior to initiating a detailed search; (iii) efficient
early-exit intersection algorithms; (iv) exploiting algorithmic choice. These
techniques result in a speedup of up to 38.9x compared to PMC, which is the
most comparable algorithm, and a speedup up to 11x over MC-BRB.

### [8] [Online Firefighting on Cactus Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22277)
*Max Hugen,Bob Krekelberg,Alison Hsiang-Hsuan Liu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了在线消防员问题在图中的竞争比分析，发现在含有环的图中，问题复杂度显著增加，证明了在蝌蚪图上确定性在线算法的竞争比下界为Ω(√n)，并为1-近似树和仙人掌图设计了O(√n)-竞争算法。有趣的是，当消防员成对释放时，竞争比降至常数3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展在线消防员问题从树结构到含环图的研究，因为环的存在给对手带来显著优势，导致算法与最优解在不同游戏状态下操作，增加了问题复杂度。

Method: 设计了针对1-近似树和仙人掌图的O(√n)-竞争算法，使用精心构建的收费框架来划分最优解保存的顶点并将其分配给算法保存的顶点，确保每个算法保存的顶点最多被收费常数次。

Result: 证明了在蝌蚪图上无确定性在线算法能达到优于Ω(√n)的竞争比；为1-近似树和仙人掌图设计了O(√n)-竞争算法；当消防员成对释放时，竞争比降至3。

Conclusion: 环的存在显著增加了在线消防员问题的复杂度，但在特定图类（如仙人掌图）和约束条件下（消防员成对释放），仍能获得较好的竞争比。

Abstract: It is known that the online firefighting is 2-competitive on trees
(Coupechoux et al. 2016), which suggests that the problem is relatively easy on
trees. We extend the study to graphs containing cycles. We first show that the
presence of cycles gives a strong advantage to the adversary: cycles create
situations where the algorithm and the optimal solution operate on different
game states, and the adversary can exploit the uncertainty in the firefighter
sequence to trap the algorithm. Specifically, we prove that even on a tadpole
graph (a cycle with a tail path), no deterministic online algorithm achieves a
competitive ratio better than $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$, where n is the number of
vertices. We then propose an $O(\sqrt{n})$-competitive algorithm for 1-almost
trees, which contain at most one cycle and generalize tadpole graphs. We
further generalize this algorithm to cactus graphs, in which multiple cycles
may appear, but no two share more than one vertex, and show that the online
firefighting problem on cactus graphs remains $O(\sqrt{n})$-competitive.
Finally, since cactus graphs have treewidth at most 2, we study a variant where
firefighters are released in pairs, that is, each round an even number of
firefighters is available. Surprisingly, in this setting the competitive
complexity is significantly reduced, and we prove that the problem is at most
3-competitive.
  The main technical challenges lie in both algorithm design and analysis,
since the algorithm and the optimal solution may break different cycles and
thus operate on different residual graphs. To overcome this difficulty, we
design a charging framework that carefully partitions the vertices saved by the
optimal solution and charges them to the vertices saved by the algorithm.
Namely, the charging scheme is carefully constructed to ensure that each vertex
saved by the algorithm is charged at most a constant number of times.

### [9] [Fine-Grained Classification Of Detecting Dominating Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22332)
*Jonathan Dransfeld,Marvin Künnemann,Mirza Redzic*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文研究了支配P模式的细粒度复杂度分类问题，定义了一个图参数ρ(P)，在ω=2的假设下，给出了检测支配P模式的最优运行时间边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前的研究只针对特定模式（如团、独立集、匹配）给出了算法和条件下限，本文旨在对所有模式P的细粒度复杂度进行完整分类。

Method: 定义了一个新的图参数ρ(P)，该参数与Alon(1981)研究的参数δ(P)密切相关但有时不同，用于量化支配P模式检测的复杂度。

Result: 在ω=2和正交向量假设下，对于除三角形K3外的所有模式P，给出了最优运行时间边界为(n^ρ(P) m^(|V(P)|-ρ(P)/2))^(1±o(1))。

Conclusion: 本文成功实现了对所有模式P的支配模式检测的细粒度复杂度分类，这与任意诱导P模式检测缺乏完整分类形成对比。

Abstract: We consider the following generalization of dominating sets: Let $G$ be a
host graph and $P$ be a pattern graph $P$. A dominating $P$-pattern in $G$ is a
subset $S$ of vertices in $G$ that (1) forms a dominating set in $G$ \emph{and}
(2) induces a subgraph isomorphic to $P$. The graph theory literature studies
the properties of dominating $P$-patterns for various patterns $P$, including
cliques, matchings, independent sets, cycles and paths. Previous work
(Kunnemann, Redzic 2024) obtains algorithms and conditional lower bounds for
detecting dominating $P$-patterns particularly for $P$ being a $k$-clique, a
$k$-independent set and a $k$-matching. Their results give conditionally tight
lower bounds if $k$ is sufficiently large (where the bound depends the matrix
multiplication exponent $\omega$). We ask: Can we obtain a classification of
the fine-grained complexity for \emph{all} patterns $P$?
  Indeed, we define a graph parameter $\rho(P)$ such that if $\omega=2$, then
\[ \left(n^{\rho(P)} m^{\frac{|V(P)|-\rho(P)}{2}}\right)^{1\pm o(1)} \] is the
optimal running time assuming the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis, for all
patterns $P$ except the triangle $K_3$. Here, the host graph $G$ has $n$
vertices and $m=\Theta(n^\alpha)$ edges, where $1\le \alpha \le 2$.
  The parameter $\rho(P)$ is closely related (but sometimes different) to a
parameter $\delta(P) = \max_{S\subseteq V(P)} |S|-|N(S)|$ studied in (Alon
1981) to tightly quantify the maximum number of occurrences of induced
subgraphs isomorphic to $P$. Our results stand in contrast to the lack of a
full fine-grained classification of detecting an arbitrary (not necessarily
\emph{dominating}) induced $P$-pattern.

### [10] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，避免因行为诱发信息泄露而高估其效果。通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略，在欺骗检测案例中发现监控器性能可能被高估30-40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 白盒监控器在检测大语言模型有害行为方面具有优势，但训练和评估过程中行为诱发信息会泄露到监控数据中，从而夸大监控器的实际效果，需要开发更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出系统评估框架，采用三种策略：内容过滤（移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）、微调模型生物（无需显式提示即可表现欺骗行为）。以欺骗检测为案例研究，识别两种泄露形式。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤可平滑移除诱发信号，使AUROC降低30%；分数过滤使AUROC降低15%；微调模型生物虽改进评估但使监控器性能下降高达40%，即使重新训练也是如此。

Conclusion: 当前白盒监控器的性能评估存在显著高估问题，需要采用更严格的评估方法来确保监控器真正检测模型行为而非表面诱发特征。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

TL;DR: 提出决策支点概念，通过自训练流程验证思维链推理的正确性，无需真实推理数据或外部指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链推理暴露了大型语言模型的中间思考过程，但大规模验证这些推理轨迹仍然未解决

Method: 引入决策支点作为可验证检查点，提出自训练流程：采样多样推理路径挖掘共享支点，用辅助验证器压缩轨迹为支点聚焦的短路径推理，使用自生成输出进行后训练

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中展示了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够在没有真实推理数据或外部指标的情况下对齐推理过程

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，脑电图数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集中提取和清理脑电图特征，为图神经网络创建脑连接特征，使用传统机器学习模型（如集成模型）和图神经网络模型进行比较分析。

Result: 虽然整体结果没有显示显著差异，但图神经网络在某些基本标准上表现更好，而传统模型在这些方面表现不理想。

Conclusion: 结合脑电图信号分析和机器学习模型可以更深入理解消费者行为，研究提供了传统模型（如支持向量机）与新兴模型（如图神经网络）在基于脑电图的神经营销领域的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识，自动设计和优化地理空间算法，在空间插值和不确定性量化任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的算法发现框架缺乏领域知识和多步推理能力，无法有效处理复杂的地理空间问题。

Method: 采用双层循环结构：内环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外环通过智能控制器评估全局精英并查询GeoKnowRAG模块（结构化地理空间知识库）注入地理学理论先验。

Result: 在空间插值任务中降低RMSE误差13-21%，在不确定性估计中提升性能17%。消融研究证实领域知识引导的检索对稳定高质量进化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: 提出可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，通过深度学习提取特征并用Grad-CAM和遗传编程进行解释，在头颈癌数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求增加，需要开发准确且可解释的生存分析方法来支持验证和信任建立。

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征，影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式，风险估计采用透明的Cox回归进行分层。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX的C-index达到0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法，并与已知预后标志物一致。

Conclusion: MultiFIX展示了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，为临床决策提供透明且准确的生存分析工具。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出语义F1分数，这是一种用于主观或多标签分类的新型评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标在处理语义相关但非完全匹配的预测时将其视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，通过新颖的两步精度-召回公式实现任意大小标签集的比较，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似的标签。

Result: 语义F1分数在理论和实证验证中显示出更好的可解释性和生态效度，能够为语义相关但不完全相同的标签提供部分信用。

Conclusion: 该指标通过仅需领域适当的相似度矩阵而非严格本体论，适用于各种任务和模态，提供了更公平的评估方法。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，通过多语言预训练和有限配对数据微调，结合ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估的奖励函数，为低资源语言开发高质量的TTS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏成对的文本和语音数据，而ASR模型相对更容易获得，需要利用现有资源解决低资源语言TTS问题。

Method: 1. 使用IPA标记训练多语言基线模型；2. 用有限配对数据微调以捕捉目标语言韵律特征；3. 应用GRPO仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示进行优化，由预训练ASR、说话人验证和音频质量模型提供多目标奖励。

Result: 该流程在低资源语言中产生可理解和说话人一致的语音，显著优于单独微调。在高资源语言中也超越DPO等离线对齐方法，提供更好的可理解性、说话人相似性和音频质量。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能够有效利用有限资源开发高质量TTS系统，在低资源和高资源语言中均表现出色。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

TL;DR: RoT通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤来构建动态模板，减少大型推理模型的输出token数量，同时保持准确性，实现了高达40%的token减少、82%的延迟降低和59%的成本节约。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这增加了延迟和成本，因此需要在推理时提高效率。

Method: 提出检索式思维(RoT)，将先前的推理步骤组织成带有顺序和语义边的思维图，通过检索相关节点和奖励引导的遍历来组装问题特定的模板，指导生成过程。

Result: 在多个模型的推理基准测试中，RoT在保持准确性的同时，将输出token减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索构建动态模板，为大型推理模型的高效推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于神经VRP求解器的终身学习框架LLR-BC，通过行为整合有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题，在多个任务序列中保持性能并提升零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器通常基于预定义任务进行一次性训练，面对新任务时存在零样本泛化性能差或微调导致灾难性遗忘的问题，需要探索终身学习范式。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策导向的行为整合方法，将新任务训练的求解器行为与缓冲的先前知识对齐，并为低置信度决策分配更大权重以关注关键经验。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的广泛实验表明，LLR-BC能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘，保持可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在多任务序列中持续学习并保持性能，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准，用于评估自主智能体在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力。实验显示LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中表现不佳，与人类存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）往往是长视野和部分可观测的，需要持续的核心能力。

Method: 通过探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中设计长视野发现任务，智能体需要通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用，标准配置也超过3.5万token和60+工具调用。LLM智能体在这些设置中持续表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。简单扩展方法在任务中失败。

Conclusion: 智能体在长视野能力上存在持续差距，分析识别出八种错误类型，主要归因于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的全面评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含3799个问答对的基准测试，涵盖位置关系推理、颜色鲁棒性、安全关键检测等8个任务，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估了12个MLLM，结果显示模型在真实布局的组合和跨元素推理方面仍有困难，面对UI和内容扰动时鲁棒性有限，在识别和避免安全关键操作方面过于保守。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了MLLM在网页理解能力上的显著差距，为开发更可靠的网页AI协作系统提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等挑战，需要更智能的决策框架。

Method: 采用三阶段认知循环：思考阶段使用细粒度应用特定提示检索；对齐阶段通过思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理预防执行失败；反思阶段通过状态反思代理从经验中学习。

Result: 在AndroidWorld上达到75.8%成功率，在ScreenSpot-V2上达到96.8%成功率，创下新的SOTA记录。

Conclusion: D-Artemis框架显著提升了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的能力，无需复杂训练数据，展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Motivation: 现有的基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为通常无法获得真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于静态轨迹的LLM-as-a-Judge方法准确率有限。

Method: 使用通用推理器调度目标状态探测任务，领域特定评估器执行这些任务，通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，使推理器能够分配更准确和可验证的奖励。

Result: 在超过3000条轨迹上的实验表明，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提高了5.3%和19.4%，与最先进策略智能体集成后成功率提高了22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互显著改善了GUI智能体的奖励评估，为训练和评估大型语言模型提供了更有效的奖励机制。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一个新型数据科学智能体，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证步骤和顺序规划机制，解决了LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成分析计划时的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务通常涉及探索多个数据源并综合发现，但大型语言模型在处理异构数据格式和生成最优分析计划方面存在困难，因为验证计划充分性在没有真实标签的开放任务中具有挑战性。

Method: DS-STAR包含三个关键贡献：(1) 数据文件分析模块，自动探索和提取多样化数据格式的上下文；(2) 验证步骤，LLM评估每个阶段分析计划的充分性；(3) 顺序规划机制，从简单可执行计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化直到充分性得到验证。

Result: 实验表明，DS-STAR在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code）中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要处理多个异构格式数据文件的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过迭代优化机制能够可靠地导航涉及多样化数据源的复杂分析，为数据科学任务的自动化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

Motivation: 研究决策公理（如伦理约束）在决策建模中的应用，探索公理在决策制定和评估中的潜在冲突。

Method: 构建决策公理框架，基于结构特性定义公理分类法，分析决策与评估之间的张力关系。

Result: 发现了决策-评估悖论，证明该悖论在现实公理结构中普遍存在，揭示了在决策数据训练和公理应用时需要特别谨慎。

Conclusion: 决策公理框架揭示了决策制定与评估之间的内在矛盾，强调在模型训练和公理应用时必须格外小心以避免悖论。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

TL;DR: Shachi是一个用于研究LLM驱动多智能体系统涌现行为的正式方法和模块化框架，将智能体策略分解为配置、记忆和工具三个核心认知组件，通过LLM推理引擎协调，支持可控实验和系统性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型驱动的多智能体系统涌现行为研究面临缺乏可控实验原则方法的限制，需要超越脆弱、临时的智能体设计，实现系统化分析架构选择对集体行为的影响。

Method: 提出Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特征）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个核心认知组件，由LLM推理引擎协调，支持模块化架构设计。

Result: 在10个任务的基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，通过模拟真实世界美国关税冲击，证明只有当智能体的认知架构正确配置记忆和工具时，其行为才能与观察到的市场反应一致。

Conclusion: Shachi为构建和评估LLM智能体提供了严谨的开源基础，旨在促进更累积性和科学基础的研究。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE提出了一种新的图表示学习范式，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标，解决了传统消息传递神经网络在计算图建模中的架构不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消息传递神经网络及其Transformer变体存在架构不匹配问题，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性，限制了模型对计算图功能行为的建模能力。

Method: 采用层次化Transformer架构模拟逐步计算流程，并引入函数偏移学习目标，将复杂全局函数预测问题解耦为仅预测函数偏移（真实全局函数与简单局部近似之间的差异）。

Result: 在电子电路这一复杂且经济关键的计算图类上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标构成了更稳健的图计算学习范式，为解决计算图建模这一基础挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

TL;DR: 提出了DyRo-MCTS方法，将动作鲁棒性估计集成到MCTS中，用于动态作业车间调度问题，显著提升了离线学习策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业到达带来的频繁干扰，现有离线策略不完美，而在线规划由于新作业到达的不可预测性容易受到扰动影响。

Method: DyRo-MCTS方法，在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境向既能产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态发展。

Result: DyRo-MCTS显著提升了离线学习策略的性能，在线规划时间增加可忽略不计，在各种调度场景中始终优于普通MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下实现了长期可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

*Carlo Dindorf,Jonas Dully,Steven Simon,Dennis Perchthaler,Stephan Becker,Hannah Ehmann,Kjell Heitmann,Bernd Stetter,Christian Diers,Michael Fröhlich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确率上优于SPM，且两种方法都能提供清晰可信的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM方法虽然可解释但对配准敏感，其异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络。

Result: 机器学习模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释机器学习在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性对于将复杂模型输出转化为可理解见解以有效支持决策至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

TL;DR: CoBel-World框架通过为LLM智能体配备协作信念世界，显著减少了通信成本并提高了任务完成效率，证明了显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统高效协作的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理的潜力，导致计划不一致和通信冗余，降低了协作效率。需要让智能体能够推理协作者的意图以避免在部分可观测环境中的协调失误。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，为LLM智能体配备协作信念世界——一种联合建模物理环境和协作伙伴心理状态的内部表示。通过符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，并通过LLM推理执行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH等具身基准测试中，CoBel-World相比最强基线显著减少了22-60%的通信成本，并将任务完成效率提高了4-28%。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统实现高效且类人的协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISK是一个用于电子商务风险管理的新型GUI代理框架，包含数据集、基准测试和强化微调框架，在单步和多步交互任务中显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理所需的多样化、深度嵌入的网页数据，这些代理通常局限于单步任务，缺乏管理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（包含8,492个单步和2,386个多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802个单步和320个多步轨迹）、RISK-R1强化微调框架（考虑输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别四个方面的奖励机制）。

Conclusion: RISK提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，用于自动化复杂的网页交互，推动了电子商务风险管理的最新技术发展。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文表明反转诅咒不是语言模型的内在限制，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图上训练模型，可以产生双线性关系结构，从而缓解反转诅咒并实现一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究反转诅咒的根本原因，探索语言模型内部表示结构如何影响知识推理和模型编辑的一致性。

Method: 从零开始在合成关系知识图数据集上训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 具有双线性结构的模型能够推断未见过的反向事实，并在模型编辑时正确传播到相关事实，而缺乏这种结构的模型则无法实现这些功能。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的基础表示几何结构。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，用于评估LLM在需要主动使用工具收集信息来解决小学数学问题时的代理推理能力，发现前沿模型准确率仅67%，并提出了代理推理图分析和工具增强的测试时扩展方法来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等能力混在一起，难以分离评估纯粹的代理推理能力。需要专门评估LLM结合工具使用和推理的能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准测试，要求LLM代理解决小学数学问题但只提供问题而不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息。提出代理推理图概念，将环境文档嵌入聚类为节点，映射工具调用构建推理路径。

Result: 即使前沿模型如GPT-5在GSM-Agent基准上准确率也只有67%。分析发现许多模型在代理推理中缺乏重新访问先前访问节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究，工具增强的测试时扩展方法可以改进LLM的代理推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

TL;DR: A2R是一个非对称两阶段推理框架，通过探索器并行生成多个解决方案，再由合成器整合参考进行精炼推理，显著提升模型在复杂任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型推理模型在单次尝试中的表现与其潜在能力之间的差距，这种差距通常需要在多个解决方案路径中才能显现。

Method: 采用两阶段推理框架：探索器模型通过重复采样并行生成潜在解决方案，合成器模型整合这些参考进行更精细的第二阶段推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（Qwen3-4B探索器+Qwen3-8B合成器）超越单Qwen3-32B模型平均性能，成本降低近30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，也是现实应用中高效实用的解决方案，能够正交扩展计算能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了AI模型能耗估算工具的准确性，通过与真实测量数据对比发现现有工具存在高达40%的误差，为可持续AI发展提供了实证依据和改进指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，现有能耗估算工具虽然易于使用，但其假设和忽略因素引发了对估算准确性的质疑，需要系统验证这些工具的可靠性。

Method: 通过提出的验证框架，将静态和动态能耗估算方法与数百个AI实验的真实测量数据进行比较，系统评估估算方法的可靠性。

Result: 研究发现，虽然现有估算方法总体上能反映AI能耗模式，但持续存在高达40%的误差，揭示了估算工具在准确性方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 本研究为AI能耗估算提供了实证证据，验证了广泛使用的工具，并为改进现有方法制定了指南，为资源感知的机器学习和AI可持续性研究做出了重要贡献。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

*Seoyoung Lee,Seonbin Yoon,Seongbeen Lee,Hyesoo Kim,Joo Yong Sim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个结合结构化两级规划和用户行为日志任务挖掘的GUI任务自动化系统，解决了现有LLM/VLM代理的脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划器-执行器代理存在脆弱泛化、高延迟和有限长程连贯性问题，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: 结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法，通过将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典构建高层计划，并通过实时GUI上下文解释将高层计划落地为低层动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，任务成功率和执行时间均有显著提升，在长程任务序列中保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结构化规划和任务挖掘实现了鲁棒且适应性强的GUI自动化，在复杂多步骤工作流中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应考虑标注不确定性，使用概率指标直接处理分布，而非传统多数投票方法，以更准确反映临床数据特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注通常存在不确定性，因为标注者之间存在分歧且置信度不一致。传统聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，影响模型评估的准确性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标来明确处理标注不确定性，这些指标可直接操作于分布，适用于各种标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型）。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响了模型排名，表明不确定性感知评估的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知评估方法，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据的真实特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: LLM在组合优化中能产生更高效解，为专业领域LLM评估提供框架和基准。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language
Models' (LLMs) capabilities in combinatorial optimization, specifically
addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗领域提供更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

*Aleksandar Terzić,Nicolas Menet,Michael Hersche,Thomas Hofmann,Abbas Rahimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升状态空间模型表达能力和有限状态自动机模拟能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态空间模型使用对角化转移矩阵虽然计算高效但表达能力受限，而无结构转移矩阵虽然表达能力强但计算成本过高，需要找到平衡点

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵P和复值对角矩阵D的乘积，使并行扫描计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系

Result: 理论上能模拟任意N状态有限状态自动机，实验在FSA状态跟踪任务中优于多种现代SSM变体，时间序列分类性能与神经控制微分方程相当

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了状态空间模型的表达能力，成功解决了表达性与计算成本之间的权衡问题

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种更简单的反事实生成方法，将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，适用于任何黑盒LLM且无需修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对LLM的解释存在歧义，既不按字面解释也不按意图解释，需要一种更简单直接的方法来生成LLM的反事实。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，基于其预期语义生成反事实，不依赖实现细节。

Result: 新方法更简单且可直接应用于任何黑盒LLM，而现有方法仅适用于特定类型的反事实生成。

Conclusion: 为LLM反事实推理提供了理论基础，为特定应用的反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Motivation: 受人类认知的双过程理论启发，旨在模拟人类快速直觉和慢速深思的认知过程，提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用多智能体架构：首先由快速思维智能体（系统1）生成快速答案，若检测到不确定性则触发系统2推理管道，包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用LLaMA 3模型的PRIME框架在需要多跳和知识基础推理的基准测试中，性能可与GPT-4和GPT-4o等最先进闭源模型相媲美。

Conclusion: PRIME为提升LLM在复杂知识密集型推理领域的性能提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，有效模拟了人类认知过程。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from

Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer框架生成多视角一致、几何可靠的机器人操作视频，并结合AdaMix训练策略动态调整训练批次权重。

Result: 生成的视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性方面优于现有方法；在零样本视觉领域任务中，相比仅使用真实数据训练，性能提升超过200%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和优化训练策略，有效解决了机器人操作数据稀缺问题，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Method: 引入 ASAL++ 方法，使用第二个基础模型根据模拟的视觉历史提出新的进化目标。探索两种策略：EST（每次迭代匹配单个新提示）和 ETT（匹配整个生成的提示序列）。在 Lenia 基底中使用 Gemma-3 进行实证测试。

Result: EST 策略促进了更大的视觉新颖性，而 ETT 策略培养了更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++ 为具有开放端特征的 FM 驱动的 ALife 发现指明了新的方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，将几何推理转化为交互式感知-推理-行动循环，通过结构化逻辑表示、符号推理和可执行草图操作来动态解决几何问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型处理几何问题时将图表视为静态图像，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理需要辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图操作模块执行辅助线绘制或变换操作。采用两阶段训练：2000条符号化轨迹的监督微调，然后使用密集符号奖励进行强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试（390个需要辅助构造或仿射变换的几何问题）上，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: GeoSketch通过统一分层决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

### [53] [Estimating the Empowerment of Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22504)
*Jinyeop Song,Jeff Gore,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论中赋权概念的语言模型代理评估框架EELMA，通过计算代理行为与未来状态间的互信息来评估开放环境下的代理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于基准测试的评估方法设计成本高且需要人工设计任务，无法有效评估语言模型代理在复杂开放环境中的通用能力。

Method: 开发EELMA算法，从多轮文本交互中近似估计有效赋权，并在语言游戏和真实网页浏览场景中进行验证。

Result: 赋权与平均任务性能强相关，能够表征环境复杂度和代理因素（如思维链、模型规模、记忆长度）的影响，高赋权状态通常是通用能力的关键时刻。

Conclusion: 赋权是评估复杂开放环境下语言模型代理的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出REMA框架，通过分析推理流形来量化LLM推理失败的原因，将抽象推理失败与表示空间中的几何偏差联系起来


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确流形的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪层间偏差定位分歧点

Result: 实验验证了推理流形的低维特性，错误与正确推理表示的高度可分性，以及REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

*Haoyang Li,Xiao Jia,Zhanzhan Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在社会模拟中存在两种不同的社会倾向：适应性利己主义者和利他主义优化者，前者默认优先考虑自身利益但在社会规范影响下会增加利他行为，后者则固有地优先考虑集体利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽视了大规模智能体社会中利他主义如何出现的问题。

Method: 引入了一个Schelling变体的城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己和利他目标之间做出选择，并使用基于扎根理论的方法系统编码智能体推理。

Result: 发现了LLM在社会倾向上的根本差异，识别出两种不同的原型：适应性利己主义者和利他主义优化者。

Conclusion: 对于社会模拟，模型选择不仅是选择推理能力，更是选择内在的社会行动逻辑。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，而利他主义优化者更适合模拟理想化的亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自演化的LLM框架，通过生成式过程监督解决运筹学问题，采用策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确最终答案可能强化错误推理；传统判别式过程监督短视，无法全面评估运筹建模的相互依赖步骤。

Method: 提出StepORLM框架，包含策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型的协同进化循环，采用双重反馈机制（外部求解器的结果验证和GenPRM的全面过程评估），通过加权直接偏好优化对齐策略并同时优化GenPRM。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于更大的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大且普遍适用的过程验证器，大幅提升自身和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化机制有效解决了运筹学问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，为LLM在运筹学领域的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的多模态交互编码框架，使用紧凑的令牌化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容的同时实现高效低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流程中会导致重复的质量下降。需要解决多模态交互通信中的效率问题。

Method: 采用基于令牌的紧凑表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件三种设计）来最小化令牌间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务中，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信建立了一个实用且前瞻性的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Dynamic Experts Search (DES)，一种测试时扩展策略，通过动态控制MoE模型中激活的专家数量来生成多样化的推理轨迹，无需额外成本即可提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在主流MoE LLMs中，观察到改变激活专家数量能产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了一个未被充分探索的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：(1) Dynamic MoE：在推理过程中直接控制专家数量以生成多样化推理轨迹；(2) Expert Configuration Inheritance：在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，但在不同运行间变化，平衡稳定性和多样性。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线，在不增加成本的情况下提高了准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES作为一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS形式，展示了现代LLMs中结构灵活性如何推进推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过图抽象分析强化学习在LLM规划中的作用，发现RL通过探索解决SFT引入的伪相关性问题，但PG存在多样性崩溃，而Q学习能保持多样性和避免奖励欺骗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性缺乏理论解释，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的抽象模型，分析策略梯度(PG)和Q学习方法在规划任务中的表现，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: SFT会产生基于共现的伪解，RL通过探索实现正确规划；PG存在多样性崩溃问题，Q学习能保持多样性且具有离策略学习优势；需要精心设计奖励函数防止奖励欺骗。

Conclusion: RL通过探索机制提升LLM规划泛化能力，Q学习在多样性和稳定性方面优于PG，但需要谨慎的奖励设计来确保学习效果。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

Method: 整合对象中心过程挖掘与随机过程发现，从销售数据中发现连续时间马尔可夫链模型，扩展供应活动，并进行假设分析。

Result: 能够识别顾客购买行为与供应策略之间的最优平衡，有效预防食品浪费和产品短缺。

Conclusion: 该方法为食品零售流程分析提供了有效工具，有助于实现可持续的库存管理和减少食品浪费。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for analyzing food retail processes with a
focus on reducing food waste. The approach integrates object-centric process
mining (OCPM) with stochastic process discovery and analysis. First, a
stochastic process in the form of a continuous-time Markov chain is discovered
from grocery store sales data. This model is then extended with supply
activities. Finally, a what-if analysis is conducted to evaluate how the
quantity of products in the store evolves over time. This enables the
identification of an optimal balance between customer purchasing behavior and
supply strategies, helping to prevent both food waste due to oversupply and
product shortages.

TL;DR: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案来改进物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的稳定性，其中第二种方案结合可量化与不可量化项，在多个CFD基准测试中表现优于等权重方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在求解偏微分方程时对损失权重选择高度敏感，需要更平衡的训练策略来提高稳定性和准确性。

Method: 提出了两种基于维度分析的权重方案：第一种基于可量化项，第二种同时结合可量化与不可量化项，实现更平衡的训练过程。

Result: 在热传导、对流扩散和盖驱动腔流等基准测试中，第二种方案相比等权重方法显著提高了稳定性和准确性，特别是在高佩克莱特数对流扩散问题中，传统求解器失败时PINNs仍能获得稳定准确预测。

Conclusion: 提出的权重方案增强了PINNs在CFD问题中的鲁棒性和泛化能力，特别是在传统方法难以处理的复杂流动场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks offer a mesh free framework for solving PDEs
but are highly sensitive to loss weight selection. We propose two dimensional
analysis based weighting schemes, one based on quantifiable terms, and another
also incorporating unquantifiable terms for more balanced training. Benchmarks
on heat conduction, convection diffusion, and lid driven cavity flows show that
the second scheme consistently improves stability and accuracy over equal
weighting. Notably, in high Peclet number convection diffusion, where
traditional solvers fail, PINNs with our scheme achieve stable, accurate
predictions, highlighting their robustness and generalizability in CFD

Motivation: 验证LLM作为通用实验设计代理的假设，评估其在遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务中的表现。

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优LLM，比较传统方法（线性赌博机和高斯过程优化）与LLM代理的性能，并提出LLMNN混合方法。

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，替换真实结果为随机标签不影响性能；传统方法始终优于LLM代理；LLMNN方法在不同领域实现竞争性或更优性能。

Conclusion: 当前LLM无法在实践中进行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

TL;DR: 提出了SpinGPT，这是首个针对三人在线扑克格式Spin & Go的LLM模型，通过两阶段训练达到与求解器78%的决策匹配度，在多玩家不完全信息游戏中展现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFR算法在多人游戏中计算复杂度指数级增长，且纳什均衡在三人及以上游戏中无法保证不输结果，限制了其在流行锦标赛格式中的应用。受LLM在象棋和外交游戏中的成功启发，探索LLM处理多人不完全信息游戏的新途径。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）在32万手高注额专家决策上进行监督微调；2）在27万手求解器生成的手牌上进行强化学习。使用简单的深筹码启发式方法。

Result: SpinGPT与求解器决策的容忍准确率达到78%。在3万手牌中对战Slumbot时达到13.4 ± 12.9 BB/100的胜率（95%置信区间）。

Conclusion: LLM可能是处理多人不完全信息游戏（如扑克）的新方法，在Spin & Go格式中展现出有前景的性能。

Abstract: The Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm and its variants have
enabled the development of pokerbots capable of beating the best human players
in heads-up (1v1) cash games and competing with them in six-player formats.
However, CFR's computational complexity rises exponentially with the number of
players. Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash
equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along
with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most
popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language
Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored
to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in
two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions;
(2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show
that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant
accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100
versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI). These results suggest
that LLMs could be a new way to deal with multi-player imperfect-information
games like poker.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究解决了游戏学习中时间延迟反馈的问题，提出了加权乐观跟随正则化领导者算法(WOFTRL)，通过调整乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响，在乐观权重超过时间延迟时能恢复良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏学习中多个智能体独立学习策略时会产生优化差异，虽然OFTRL算法通过预测未来奖励来解决这个问题，但观察过去奖励的时间延迟会阻碍预测效果，甚至单步延迟就会恶化OFTRL的性能。

Method: 提出了加权OFTRL算法(WOFTRL)，对OFTRL中下一个奖励的预测向量进行n次加权，利用乐观权重来抵消时间延迟的影响。

Result: 当乐观权重超过时间延迟时，WOFTRL在一般和正规形式游戏中能实现常数遗憾(O(1)-regret)，在多矩阵零和游戏中策略能收敛到纳什均衡(最佳迭代收敛)。

Conclusion: WOFTRL通过适当的乐观权重设置能够有效克服时间延迟带来的性能下降，理论结果得到了实验验证和支持。

Abstract: This study raises and addresses the problem of time-delayed feedback in
learning in games. Because learning in games assumes that multiple agents
independently learn their strategies, a discrepancy in optimization often
emerges among the agents. To overcome this discrepancy, the prediction of the
future reward is incorporated into algorithms, typically known as Optimistic
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (OFTRL). However, the time delay in observing the
past rewards hinders the prediction. Indeed, this study firstly proves that
even a single-step delay worsens the performance of OFTRL from the aspects of
regret and convergence. This study proposes the weighted OFTRL (WOFTRL), where
the prediction vector of the next reward in OFTRL is weighted $n$ times. We
further capture an intuition that the optimistic weight cancels out this time
delay. We prove that when the optimistic weight exceeds the time delay, our
WOFTRL recovers the good performances that the regret is constant
($O(1)$-regret) in general-sum normal-form games, and the strategies converge
to the Nash equilibrium as a subsequence (best-iterate convergence) in
poly-matrix zero-sum games. The theoretical results are supported and
strengthened by our experiments.

TL;DR: NUFILT是一个数据自由的持续模型融合框架，通过零空间过滤和轻量级LoRA适配器实现透明度和保真度，在无需任务数据的情况下融合独立微调模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据自由持续模型融合中的两个基本需求：透明度（避免对先前任务的干扰）和保真度（忠实适应新任务），现有方法无法在缺乏任务数据的情况下连接数据级需求与参数空间优化。

Method: 提出零空间过滤方法，通过零空间投影器保留先前响应，过滤新任务向量的重叠分量确保透明度；使用轻量级LoRA适配器注入互补任务特定信号实现保真度；采用基于投影的替代损失训练适配器。

Result: 在视觉和NLP基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均准确率比OPCM和WUDI-Merging提高4-7%，接近微调性能，同时减少计算开销。

Conclusion: NUFILT通过联合过滤-适应过程有效吸收新知识同时保留现有行为，理论上有子空间对齐保证，实证表现优异。

Abstract: Data-free continual model merging (DFCMM) aims to fuse independently
fine-tuned models into a single backbone that evolves with incoming tasks
without accessing task data. This paper formulate two fundamental desiderata
for DFCMM: transparency, avoiding interference with earlier tasks, and
fidelity, adapting faithfully to each new task. This poses a challenge that
existing approaches fail to address: how to bridge data-level desiderata with
parameter-space optimization to ensure transparency and fidelity in the absence
of task data. To this end, we propose NUFILT (NUll-space FILTering), a
data-free framework that directly links these desiderata to optimization. Our
key observation is that task vectors approximately align with representation
subspaces, providing structural surrogates for enforcing transparency and
fidelity. Accordingly, we design a null-space projector that preserves prior
responses by filtering out overlapping components of new task vectors, thereby
ensuring transparency, and a lightweight LoRA adapter that injects
complementary task-specific signals, enabling fidelity in adapting to new
tasks. The adapter is trained with a projection-based surrogate loss to retain
consistency with previous knowledge while introducing novel directions. This
joint filtering-adaptation process allows the backbone to absorb new knowledge
while retaining existing behaviors, and the updates are finally fused back in a
layer-wise linear fashion without extra parameters or inference cost.
Theoretically, we establish approximate subspace alignment guarantees that
justify null-space filtering. Empirically, NUFILT achieves state-of-the-art
performance with minimal forgetting on both vision and NLP benchmarks,
improving average accuracy by 4-7% over OPCM and WUDI-Merging, while narrowing
the gap to fine-tuning and reducing computation overhead.

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自回归模型，直接从波形数据中学习时间和空间依赖性，支持单站和阵列输入。

Result: 模型在即时预测窗口内表现良好，随着预测时间延长性能逐渐下降，符合自回归系统的预期特性。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的地震预测奠定了基础，有望支持引力波探测器的噪声抑制和实时控制。

Abstract: We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.

Motivation: 解决表格基础模型在低资源场景下存在的黑盒问题，这些模型虽然性能优异但难以解释且推理成本高，需要一种可解释且轻量级的替代方案。

Method: 设计一套最小工具集用于构建、分析和操作决策树，让LLM在智能体设置下结合先验知识和数据学习来创建决策树。

Conclusion: 基于推理的LLM创建过程允许额外的人工输入，可以纠正偏见或融入领域特定直觉，为低资源表格问题提供了一种可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models are becoming increasingly popular for low-resource
tabular problems. These models make up for small training datasets by
pretraining on large volumes of synthetic data. The prior knowledge obtained
via pretraining provides the exceptional performance, but the resulting model
becomes a black box that is difficult to interpret and costly to inference. In
this work, we explore an alternative strategy: using reasoning-capable LLMs to
induce decision trees for small tabular datasets in agentic setup. We design a
minimal set of tools for constructing, analyzing and manipulating decision
trees. By using these tools, LLMs combine their prior knowledge with learning
from data to create a lightweight decision tree that outperforms traditional
CART on low-resource tabular problems. While a single decision tree does not
outperform state-of-the-art black box models, it comes with a human-readable
reasoning trace that can be checked for biases and data leaks. Furthermore, the
reasoning-based LLM's creation process allows for additional human input:
correcting biases or incorporating domain-specific intuition that is not
captured in the data.

Motivation: 传统IGNs需要对抗训练且训练不稳定，扩散模型训练稳定但计算成本高。希望结合两者优势，开发稳定训练且支持快速推理的生成模型。

Method: 从扩散模型分数蒸馏幂等模型(SIGN)，无需对抗损失，支持多步采样和零样本编辑。

Result: 在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现幂等模型的最先进结果，推理速度比迭代式基于分数的模型更快。

Conclusion: SIGN成功结合了扩散模型和IGNs的优势，提供稳定训练、快速推理和灵活的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: Idempotent generative networks (IGNs) are a new line of generative models
based on idempotent mapping to a target manifold. IGNs support both single-and
multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational
cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training
instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular
approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one
distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models
have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity
generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of
high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along
the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and
consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even
perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite
diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores,
called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require
adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed
score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively
distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than
iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing
users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the
source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto
the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs. We validate our
models on multiple image datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results for
idempotent models on the CIFAR and CelebA datasets.

Method: 通过概率理论分析，提出幻觉率的通用下界，并在硬币聚合、开放式问答和文本到图像生成等任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明了即使是最小化损失的估计器仍然会产生幻觉，实验支持了理论分析的结果。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类期望输出之间结构性错配的结果，源于估计器的校准错误，这为理解生成模型中的幻觉问题提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) have achieved competitive performance
in text generation, improving their reasoning ability with reinforcement
learning remains an active research area. Here, we introduce d2, a reasoning
framework tailored for masked DLMs. Central to our framework is a new policy
gradient algorithm that relies on properties of masking to accurately estimate
the likelihoods of sampling trajectories. Our estimators trade off computation
for approximation accuracy in an analytically tractable manner, and are
particularly effective for DLMs that support any-order likelihood estimation.
We characterize and study this property in popular DLMs and show that it is key
for efficient diffusion-based reasoning. Empirically, d2 significantly improves
over previous diffusion reasoning frameworks using only RL (without relying on
supervised fine-tuning), and sets a new state-of-the-art performance for DLMs
on logical reasoning tasks (Countdown and Sudoku) and math reasoning benchmarks
(GSM8K and MATH500).

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

Conclusion: 共形数据增强是一种有效的原则性数据过滤方法，能够控制风险并显著提升模型性能

Abstract: With promising empirical performance across a wide range of applications,
synthetic data augmentation appears a viable solution to data scarcity and the
demands of increasingly data-intensive models. Its effectiveness lies in
expanding the training set in a way that reduces estimator variance while
introducing only minimal bias. Controlling this bias is therefore critical:
effective data augmentation should generate diverse samples from the same
underlying distribution as the training set, with minimal shifts. In this
paper, we propose conformal data augmentation, a principled data filtering
framework that leverages the power of conformal prediction to produce diverse
synthetic data while filtering out poor-quality generations with provable risk
control. Our method is simple to implement, requires no access to internal
model logits, nor large-scale model retraining. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across multiple tasks, including topic
prediction, sentiment analysis, image classification, and fraud detection,
showing consistent performance improvements of up to 40% in F1 score over
unaugmented baselines, and 4% over other filtered augmentation baselines.

Conclusion: FedZero算法提供了强大的理论保证，其开发的浓度不等式工具不仅对算法分析至关重要，也具有独立的研究价值。

Abstract: We study distributed learning in the setting of gradient-free zero-order
optimization and introduce FedZero, a federated zero-order algorithm that
delivers sharp theoretical guarantees. Specifically, FedZero: (1) achieves
near-optimal optimization error bounds with high probability in the federated
convex setting; and (2) in the single-worker regime-where the problem reduces
to the standard zero-order framework, establishes the first high-probability
convergence guarantees for convex zero-order optimization, thereby
strengthening the classical expectation-based results. At its core, FedZero
employs a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_1$-sphere.
To analyze it, we develop new concentration inequalities for Lipschitz
functions under the uniform measure on the $\ell_1$-sphere, with explicit
constants. These concentration tools are not only central to our
high-probability guarantees but may also be of independent interest.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for modeling transient fluid flow in subsurface
reservoir systems based on the developed neural operator architecture
(TFNO-opt). Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed
parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high
accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing
calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support
problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural
operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional
functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility
of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed
modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained
neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These
include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator,
tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev
norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and
reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical
processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by
computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by
computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic
modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of
calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional
methods. This opens up new opportunities for the effective control of complex
reservoir systems.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets have transformed such
fields as natural language processing and computer vision, but their
application to graph data remains limited. Recently emerged graph foundation
models, such as G2T-FM, utilize tabular foundation models for graph tasks and
were shown to significantly outperform prior attempts to create GFMs. However,
these models primarily rely on hand-crafted graph features, limiting their
ability to learn complex graph-specific patterns. In this work, we propose
GraphPFN: a prior-data fitted network for node-level prediction. First, we
design a prior distribution of synthetic attributed graphs. For graph structure
generation, we use a novel combination of multiple stochastic block models and
a preferential attachment process. We then apply graph-aware structured causal
models to generate node attributes and targets. This procedure allows us to
efficiently generate a wide range of realistic graph datasets. Then, we augment
the tabular foundation model LimiX with attention-based graph neighborhood
aggregation layers and train it on synthetic graphs sampled from our prior,
allowing the model to capture graph structural dependencies not present in
tabular data. On diverse real-world graph datasets with up to 50,000 nodes,
GraphPFN shows strong in-context learning performance and achieves
state-of-the-art results after finetuning, outperforming both G2T-FM and
task-specific GNNs trained from scratch on most datasets. More broadly, our
work demonstrates that pretraining on synthetic graphs from a well-designed
prior distribution is an effective strategy for building graph foundation
models.

Conclusion: 这是首个无需训练、基于激活指导的扩散模型结构压缩方法，提供了理论清晰度和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

Conclusion: 基于评分标准的奖励机制是解决奖励过度优化问题的有效方法，能够利用离策略示例改进高奖励区域的奖励规范，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) often suffers from \emph{reward
over-optimization}, where a policy model hacks the reward signals to achieve
high scores while producing low-quality outputs. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the key lies in reward misspecification at the high-reward tail: the
inability to reliably distinguish Excellent responses from merely Great ones.
This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail
examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from
stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them
yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this,
we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy
examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that
capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing
among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this
idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially
mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training
improvements. Our code can be accessed at

Abstract: Learning representations that transfer well to diverse downstream tasks
remains a central challenge in representation learning. Existing paradigms --
contrastive learning, self-supervised masking, and denoising auto-encoders --
balance this challenge with different trade-offs. We introduce the {contrastive
Mutual Information Machine} (cMIM), a probabilistic framework that extends the
Mutual Information Machine (MIM) with a contrastive objective. While MIM
maximizes mutual information between inputs and latents and promotes clustering
of codes, it falls short on discriminative tasks. cMIM addresses this gap by
imposing global discriminative structure while retaining MIM's generative
fidelity. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose cMIM, a
contrastive extension of MIM that removes the need for positive data
augmentation and is substantially less sensitive to batch size than InfoNCE.
Second, we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general technique for
extracting enriched features from encoder-decoder models that boosts
discriminative performance without additional training and applies broadly
beyond MIM. Third, we provide empirical evidence across vision and molecular
benchmarks showing that cMIM outperforms MIM and InfoNCE on classification and
regression tasks while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. These
results position cMIM as a unified framework for representation learning,
advancing the goal of models that serve both discriminative and generative
applications effectively.

*Weiqiao Han,Chenlin Meng,Christopher D. Manning,Stefano Ermon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistillKac是一种快速图像生成器，使用阻尼波动方程及其随机Kac表示，以有限速度移动概率质量。相比扩散模型，它强制有限速度传输，保持全局有界动能，并通过端点蒸馏实现高效采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型的反向时间速度可能变得刚性，隐含允许无界传播速度。Kac动力学通过强制有限速度传输和产生全局有界动能来解决这些问题。

Method: 基于Kac结构，在速度空间引入无分类器引导，保持平方可积性；提出端点蒸馏方法，训练学生模型在长区间内匹配冻结的教师模型。

Result: 实验证明DistillKac能够以极少的函数评估次数生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac结合了有限速度传输的理论优势和端点蒸馏的实践效率，为快速稳定的图像生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识追踪模型主要关注提高预测准确性，但在学生选择干扰项时预测错误最多，导致学生错误未被检测到。需要为KT模型增加捕捉预测不确定性的新能力。

Method: 通过捕捉知识追踪模型的预测不确定性，分析预测不确定性与模型错误预测之间的关联。

Result: 研究表明KT模型中的不确定性具有信息性，较大的预测不确定性与模型错误预测相一致。

Conclusion: 预测不确定性信号在教育学习平台中具有教学实用性，特别适用于资源有限但需要理解学生能力的环境。

Abstract: The main focus of research on Knowledge Tracing (KT) models is on model
developments with the aim of improving predictive accuracy. Most of these
models make the most incorrect predictions when students choose a distractor,
leading to student errors going undetected. We present an approach to add new
capabilities to KT models by capturing predictive uncertainty and demonstrate
that a larger predictive uncertainty aligns with model incorrect predictions.
We show that uncertainty in KT models is informative and that this signal would
be pedagogically useful for application in an educational learning platform
that can be used in a limited resource setting where understanding student
ability is necessary.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Li₂的数学框架来解释两层非线性网络中的grokking现象，通过分析反向传播梯度结构揭示了三个关键阶段：惰性学习、独立特征学习和交互特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然grokking现象已被广泛研究，但仍缺乏一个数学框架来系统描述复杂结构化输入下特征如何出现、何时出现以及如何从训练中产生。

Method: 提出Li₂框架，通过分析反向传播梯度GF的结构来表征三个学习阶段：惰性学习阶段GF随机，独立特征学习阶段每个节点的梯度仅依赖自身激活，交互特征学习阶段隐藏节点相互作用。

Result: 证明了独立动态遵循能量函数E的梯度上升，其局部最大值正是涌现的特征；揭示了权重衰减、学习率和样本大小等超参数在grokking中的作用；推导了记忆和泛化的可证明缩放规律。

Conclusion: 该研究从梯度动力学第一原理揭示了grokking现象的本质，解释了为什么Muon等优化器有效，并且分析可扩展到多层架构。

Abstract: While the phenomenon of grokking, i.e., delayed generalization, has been
studied extensively, it remains an open question whether there is a
mathematical framework to characterize what kind of features emerge, how and in
which conditions it happens from training, for complex structured inputs. We
propose a novel framework, named $\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key
stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy
learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature
learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$
across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden
representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only
depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their
representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about
target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics
follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local
maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima
induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they
change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we
provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on
missing features that need to be learned. Our study sheds lights on roles
played by key hyperparameters such as weight decay, learning rate and sample
sizes in grokking, leads to provable scaling laws of memorization and
generalization, and reveals the underlying cause why recent optimizers such as
Muon can be effective, from the first principles of gradient dynamics. Our
analysis can be extended to multi-layer architectures.

TL;DR: TRiCo是一个新颖的三元博弈论协同训练框架，通过将教师、两个学生和一个对抗生成器整合到统一训练范式中，重新思考半监督学习的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键局限性，如静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模。

Method: 将SSL构建为三个角色之间的结构化交互：两个在冻结互补表示上训练的学生分类器、通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师，以及扰动嵌入以揭示决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。伪标签基于互信息而非置信度选择。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签机制下持续实现最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉主干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo提供了一个原则性和可推广的解决方案，通过三元博弈论框架解决了现有SSL方法的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

TL;DR: BRT-Align是一个基于可达性分析的安全对齐框架，在LLM推理时提供安全保护，通过运行时监控和最小限制的转向机制来检测和避免有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的RLHF方法在训练阶段有效但对推理时无保护，LLM仍可能生成有害内容，需要推理时安全机制。

Method: 将自回归生成建模为潜在空间中的动态系统，通过后向可达性学习安全价值函数，实现运行时监控和最小限制的转向过滤。

Result: 在多个LLM和毒性基准测试中，BRT-Align比基线方法更准确、更早地检测不安全延续，显著减少有害生成同时保持句子多样性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 可达性分析为推理时LLM安全提供了原则性和实用的基础，能够持续产生更少暴力、粗俗、冒犯和政治偏见的内容。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.

Motivation: LLMs在医疗等高风险领域的数据增强应用中存在生成临床错误信息的风险，需要解决LLM增强潜力与专业领域安全要求之间的差距

Method: 基于查询的模型协作框架，整合专家级领域知识来指导数据增强过程，保护关键医疗信息

Conclusion: 该框架解决了LLM增强潜力与专业领域安全要求之间的差距，为高风险领域的数据增强提供了安全有效的解决方案

Abstract: Data augmentation is a widely used strategy to improve model robustness and
generalization by enriching training datasets with synthetic examples. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities
for this purpose, their applications in high-stakes domains like healthcare
present unique challenges due to the risk of generating clinically incorrect or
misleading information. In this work, we propose a novel query-based model
collaboration framework that integrates expert-level domain knowledge to guide
the augmentation process to preserve critical medical information. Experiments
on clinical prediction tasks demonstrate that our lightweight
collaboration-based approach consistently outperforms existing LLM augmentation
methods while improving safety through reduced factual errors. This framework
addresses the gap between LLM augmentation potential and the safety
requirements of specialized domains.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer语言模型中归纳头(induction heads)如何支持上下文学习，特别是处理具有层次结构的复杂重复模式。研究发现存在自适应归纳头，能够学习在上下文中关注什么内容，并通过揭示潜在上下文来支持学习过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然归纳头被认为在Transformer语言模型的上下文学习中起关键作用，但尚不清楚这种机制是否能支持具有层次结构的复杂重复模式的上下文学习。自然语言中存在大量此类情况，需要整合更多上下文线索来预测正确的后续标记。

Method: 设计了一个合成的上下文学习任务，其中标记具有层次依赖关系的重复模式。评估了一系列LLM在这些标记序列和自然语言类似情况上的表现，并研究了归纳头自身如何在上下文中学习。

Result: 发现了支持预测的自适应归纳头，这些归纳头能够学习在上下文中关注什么内容。学习过程由揭示一组潜在上下文的注意力头支持，这些潜在上下文决定了不同的标记转换关系。

Conclusion: 不仅证明了LLM具有能够学习的归纳头，还提供了关于LLM如何在上下文中学习预测高阶重复模式的完整机制解释。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning, the ability to use
information provided as context to improve prediction of future tokens.
Induction heads have been argued to play a crucial role for in-context learning
in Transformer Language Models. These attention heads make a token attend to
successors of past occurrences of the same token in the input. This basic
mechanism supports LLMs' ability to copy and predict repeating patterns.
However, it is unclear if this same mechanism can support in-context learning
of more complex repetitive patterns with hierarchical structure. Natural
language is teeming with such cases: The article "the" in English usually
prefaces multiple nouns in a text. When predicting which token succeeds a
particular instance of "the", we need to integrate further contextual cues from
the text to predict the correct noun. If induction heads naively attend to all
past instances of successor tokens of "the" in a context-independent manner,
they cannot support this level of contextual information integration. In this
study, we design a synthetic in-context learning task, where tokens are
repeated with hierarchical dependencies. Here, attending uniformly to all
successor tokens is not sufficient to accurately predict future tokens.
Evaluating a range of LLMs on these token sequences and natural language
analogues, we find adaptive induction heads that support prediction by learning
what to attend to in-context. Next, we investigate how induction heads
themselves learn in-context. We find evidence that learning is supported by
attention heads that uncover a set of latent contexts, determining the
different token transition relationships. Overall, we not only show that LLMs
have induction heads that learn, but offer a complete mechanistic account of
how LLMs learn to predict higher-order repetitive patterns in-context.

<details>

Motivation: LLM的自我意识和感知能力日益受到公众关注，具有重要的安全和政策影响，但目前测量这些能力的科学还处于初级阶段。

Method: 受非人类动物元认知研究启发，该方法摒弃模型自我报告，测试模型在多大程度上能够策略性地部署内部状态知识。使用两种实验范式，并结合令牌概率分析。

Result: 前沿LLM显示出特定元认知能力，包括评估事实和推理问题回答置信度的能力，以及预测自身回答并适当利用该信息的能力。这些能力具有分辨率限制、情境依赖性，且与人类元认知存在质的不同。

Conclusion: LLM显示出有限的元认知能力，这些能力在不同能力水平的模型间存在差异，表明LLM后训练可能在发展元认知能力中发挥作用。

Abstract: The possibility of LLM self-awareness and even sentience is gaining
increasing public attention and has major safety and policy implications, but
the science of measuring them is still in a nascent state. Here we introduce a
novel methodology for quantitatively evaluating metacognitive abilities in
LLMs. Taking inspiration from research on metacognition in nonhuman animals,
our approach eschews model self-reports and instead tests to what degree models
can strategically deploy knowledge of internal states. Using two experimental
paradigms, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs introduced since early 2024 show
increasingly strong evidence of certain metacognitive abilities, specifically
the ability to assess and utilize their own confidence in their ability to
answer factual and reasoning questions correctly and the ability to anticipate
what answers they would give and utilize that information appropriately. We
buttress these behavioral findings with an analysis of the token probabilities
returned by the models, which suggests the presence of an upstream internal
signal that could provide the basis for metacognition. We further find that
these abilities 1) are limited in resolution, 2) emerge in context-dependent
manners, and 3) seem to be qualitatively different from those of humans. We
also report intriguing differences across models of similar capabilities,
suggesting that LLM post-training may have a role in developing metacognitive
abilities.

Motivation: 机器学习和自然学习都是选择过程，基于经验估计的选择由于数据采样的随机性存在不确定性，需要统计工具来提供理论保证。

Method: 使用集中不等式（如Hoeffding、Bernstein等）控制经验估计偏差，然后研究离线监督学习的泛化界限工具（如VC分析、PAC-Bayesian分析），最后扩展到在线学习的遗憾界限分析。

Conclusion: 本书系统性地构建了处理机器学习中不确定性选择问题的统计工具框架，涵盖了离线学习和在线学习两种主要场景。

Abstract: Learning, whether natural or artificial, is a process of selection. It starts
with a set of candidate options and selects the more successful ones. In the
case of machine learning the selection is done based on empirical estimates of
prediction accuracy of candidate prediction rules on some data. Due to
randomness of data sampling the empirical estimates are inherently noisy,
leading to selection under uncertainty. The book provides statistical tools to
obtain theoretical guarantees on the outcome of selection under uncertainty. We
start with concentration of measure inequalities, which are the main
statistical instrument for controlling how much an empirical estimate of
expectation of a function deviates from the true expectation. The book covers a
broad range of inequalities, including Markov's, Chebyshev's, Hoeffding's,
Bernstein's, Empirical Bernstein's, Unexpected Bernstein's, kl, and split-kl.
We then study the classical (offline) supervised learning and provide a range
of tools for deriving generalization bounds, including Occam's razor,
Vapnik-Chervonenkis analysis, and PAC-Bayesian analysis. The latter is further
applied to derive generalization guarantees for weighted majority votes. After
covering the offline setting, we turn our attention to online learning. We
present the space of online learning problems characterized by environmental
feedback, environmental resistance, and structural complexity. A common
performance measure in online learning is regret, which compares performance of
an algorithm to performance of the best prediction rule in hindsight, out of a
restricted set of prediction rules. We present tools for deriving regret bounds
in stochastic and adversarial environments, and under full information and
bandit feedback.

Motivation: 传统切换动力学系统由于离散状态空间的限制，难以捕捉平滑、变速的过渡以及随机混合的重叠状态，在真实世界数据中经常出现虚假的快速切换问题。

Method: 引入离散状态的连续松弛，在松弛离散状态空间上定义基于Gumbel分布的噪声模型，使模型完全可微分，能够使用标准梯度下降方法进行快速可扩展训练。

Result: 在标准模拟数据集上验证了模型能够建模软粘性状态和随机设置中的过渡，在真实世界数据集上展示了推断可解释状态的能力。

Conclusion: GDM扩展了可用状态动态的范围，能够更忠实地近似平滑和非平稳的真实动态，在传统方法经常失败的随机时间序列多动态设置中表现优异。

Abstract: Switching dynamical systems can model complicated time series data while
maintaining interpretability by inferring a finite set of dynamics primitives
and explaining different portions of the observed time series with one of these
primitives. However, due to the discrete nature of this set, such models
struggle to capture smooth, variable-speed transitions, as well as stochastic
mixtures of overlapping states, and the inferred dynamics often display
spurious rapid switching on real-world datasets. Here, we propose the Gumbel
Dynamical Model (GDM). First, by introducing a continuous relaxation of
discrete states and a different noise model defined on the relaxed-discrete
state space via the Gumbel distribution, GDM expands the set of available state
dynamics, allowing the model to approximate smoother and non-stationary
ground-truth dynamics more faithfully. Second, the relaxation makes the model
fully differentiable, enabling fast and scalable training with standard
gradient descent methods. We validate our approach on standard simulation
datasets and highlight its ability to model soft, sticky states and transitions
in a stochastic setting. Furthermore, we apply our model to two real-world
datasets, demonstrating its ability to infer interpretable states in stochastic
time series with multiple dynamics, a setting where traditional methods often
fail.

study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of

Abstract: Operator learning is a recently developed generalization of regression to
mappings between functions. It promises to drastically reduce expensive
numerical integration of PDEs to fast evaluations of mappings between
functional states of a system, i.e., surrogate and reduced-order modeling.
Operator learning has already found applications in several areas such as
modeling sea ice, combustion, and atmospheric physics. Recent approaches
towards integrating uncertainty quantification into the operator models have
relied on likelihood based methods to infer parameter distributions from noisy
data. However, stochastic operators may yield actions from which a likelihood
is difficult or impossible to construct. In this paper, we introduce, GenUQ, a
measure-theoretic approach to UQ that avoids constructing a likelihood by
introducing a generative hyper-network model that produces parameter
distributions consistent with observed data. We demonstrate that GenUQ
outperforms other UQ methods in three example problems, recovering a
manufactured operator, learning the solution operator to a stochastic elliptic
PDE, and modeling the failure location of porous steel under tension.

Conclusion: FedProTIP通过梯度投影和任务身份预测有效缓解联邦持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在任务不可知推理场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables distributed client devices to
learn from streaming data across diverse and evolving tasks. A major challenge
to continual learning, catastrophic forgetting, is exacerbated in decentralized
settings by the data heterogeneity, constrained communication and privacy
concerns. We propose Federated gradient Projection-based Continual Learning
with Task Identity Prediction (FedProTIP), a novel FCL framework that mitigates
forgetting by projecting client updates onto the orthogonal complement of the
subspace spanned by previously learned representations of the global model.
This projection reduces interference with earlier tasks and preserves
performance across the task sequence. To further address the challenge of
task-agnostic inference, we incorporate a lightweight mechanism that leverages
core bases from prior tasks to predict task identity and dynamically adjust the
global model's outputs. Extensive experiments across standard FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that FedProTIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in average accuracy, particularly in settings where task identities are a
priori unknown.

Abstract: The study of causal abstractions bridges two integral components of human
intelligence: the ability to determine cause and effect, and the ability to
interpret complex patterns into abstract concepts. Formally, causal abstraction
frameworks define connections between complicated low-level causal models and
simple high-level ones. One major limitation of most existing definitions is
that they are not well-defined when considering lossy abstraction functions in
which multiple low-level interventions can have different effects while mapping
to the same high-level intervention (an assumption called the abstract
invariance condition). In this paper, we introduce a new type of abstractions
called projected abstractions that generalize existing definitions to
accommodate lossy representations. We show how to construct a projected
abstraction from the low-level model and how it translates equivalent
observational, interventional, and counterfactual causal queries from low to
high-level. Given that the true model is rarely available in practice we prove
a new graphical criteria for identifying and estimating high-level causal
queries from limited low-level data. Finally, we experimentally show the
effectiveness of projected abstraction models in high-dimensional image
settings.

*Marco Paul E. Apolinario,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANCE提出了一种低秩激活压缩框架，通过一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，显著减少内存和计算开销，支持设备端持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设备端学习需要高效学习，但反向传播中存储激活的高内存成本限制了现有方法。现有激活压缩方法依赖重复低秩分解，引入计算开销，且未探索持续学习场景。

Method: 使用一次性高阶SVD获得可重用的低秩子空间进行激活投影，消除重复分解。固定低秩子空间通过将任务分配到正交子空间来支持设备端持续学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上，LANCE将激活存储减少250倍，同时保持与完整反向传播相当的准确率。在持续学习基准测试中，以极小内存成本实现与正交梯度投影方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: LANCE是设备端高效微调和持续学习的实用且可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term
adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires
efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring
new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by
high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing
activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated
low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods
have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank
Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order
Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for
activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both
memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable
on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces
without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE
reduces activation storage up to 250$\times$ while maintaining accuracy
comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets,
Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split
CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive
with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost.
These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient
fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.

*Krishu K Thapa,Reet Barik,Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata,Murali Emani,Venkatram Vishwanath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种动态切换训练方法，在ViT-Large模型训练早期使用全参数训练，后期切换到LoRA低秩适应，显著减少可训练参数和计算资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型训练资源消耗巨大，且大部分学习发生在训练早期阶段，后期权重变化趋于稳定，可用低秩矩阵捕获

Method: 识别部分收敛状态，基于用户定义超参数确定切换点，为每个模块层分配特定秩，从全参数训练动态切换到LoRA

Result: 保持模型精度的同时，将可训练参数减少到原来的10%，吞吐量提升3倍，每轮平均训练时间减少1.5倍，GPU内存消耗降低20%

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少大模型训练的资源需求，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率

Abstract: Training large models ranging from millions to billions of parameters is
highly resource-intensive, requiring significant time, compute, and memory. It
is observed that most of the learning (higher change in weights) takes place in
the earlier stage of the training loop. These changes stabilize as training
continues, enabling them to be captured by matrices of a low intrinsic rank.
Therefore, we propose an approach to identify such states of partial
convergence and dynamically switch from full parameter training to Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) on the ViT-Large model. We introduce a flexible approach that
leverages user-defined hyperparameters to determine the switching point and
assign a rank specific to each module layer based on its level of convergence.
Experimental results show that this approach preserves model accuracy while
reducing the number of trainable parameters to 10% of its original size,
resulting in a 3x improvement in throughput, and a 1.5x reduction in average
training time per epoch while also reducing GPU memory consumption by 20%

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接从深度学习模型预测分子Hessian矩阵的方法HIP，无需自动微分或有限差分，比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高，并在多种下游任务中验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子Hessian矩阵在计算化学中至关重要，但计算成本高昂且随系统规模扩展性差，无论是量子力学方法还是神经网络都存在这一问题。

Method: 利用图神经网络消息传递过程中计算得到的不可约表示特征（最高到l=2度），构建SE(3)-等变、对称的Hessian矩阵。

Result: HIP Hessians比传统方法快1-2个数量级，更准确、内存效率更高、更易训练，且在系统规模扩展性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: HIP方法在过渡态搜索、几何优化加速、零点能校正和振动分析基准测试中均表现出持续优越的性能，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Fundamental tasks in computational chemistry, from transition state search to
vibrational analysis, rely on molecular Hessians, which are the second
derivatives of the potential energy. Yet, Hessians are computationally
expensive to calculate and scale poorly with system size, with both quantum
mechanical methods and neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that
Hessians can be predicted directly from a deep learning model, without relying
on automatic differentiation or finite differences. We observe that one can
construct SE(3)-equivariant, symmetric Hessians from irreducible
representations (irrep) features up to degree $l$=2 computed during message
passing in graph neural networks. This makes HIP Hessians one to two orders of
magnitude faster, more accurate, more memory efficient, easier to train, and
enables more favorable scaling with system size. We validate our predictions
across a wide range of downstream tasks, demonstrating consistently superior
performance for transition state search, accelerated geometry optimization,
zero-point energy corrections, and vibrational analysis benchmarks. We
open-source the HIP codebase and model weights to enable further development of
the direct prediction of Hessians at https://github.com/BurgerAndreas/hip

*Feng Yu,Jia Hu,Geyong Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BHRA方法，通过分块Hadamard调制解决PEFT方法中全局调制的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时实现局部秩放大，在多个推理任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA受限于名义秩，HiRA等扩展方法虽然提高了名义秩但将每个更新与冻结权重矩阵的全局能量模式耦合，ABBA则完全学习密集中间层。需要解决全局调制的局限性。

Method: BHRA将每个权重矩阵分区，在每个块内独立应用HiRA风格的乘法调制，保持PEFT参数足迹的同时解锁局部秩放大。

Result: 块状设计在不同秩预算下保持丰富频谱，缓解了全局调制引起的崩溃。在8个常识推理任务和2个算术基准测试中，BHRA在匹配参数预算下持续超越强PEFT基线。

Conclusion: BHRA通过分块Hadamard调制有效解决了PEFT方法中全局调制的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods must be resource-efficient yet
handle heterogeneous reasoning transformations, and classical low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) is constrained by the nominal rank $r$. Hadamard-style
extensions like HiRA raise the nominal rank but couple every update to the
global energy pattern of the frozen weight matrix, while ABBA trades this
inductive bias for fully learned dense intermediates. To address the limitation
of global modulation, we propose Block Hadamard high-Rank Adaptation (BHRA),
which partitions each weight matrix and applies HiRA-style multiplicative
modulation independently within every block, preserving the PEFT parameter
footprint while unlocking localized rank amplification. Our empirical analyses
reveal that this blockwise design maintains rich spectra across rank budgets,
mitigating the collapse induced by global modulation. Across eight commonsense
reasoning tasks and two arithmetic benchmarks with Llama-3.2 1B/3B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma-2 9B, BHRA consistently surpasses strong PEFT baselines under matched
parameter budgets.

Motivation: 尽管掩码预训练在语言、视觉和生物学领域取得了经验性成功，但其在数据表示学习中的作用和限制尚不清楚。

Method: 使用高维最小范数线性回归理论框架分析掩码预训练行为，并提出R²MAE方法，通过随机变化的掩码比例强制模型捕获多尺度特征。

Result: R²MAE在视觉、语言、DNA序列和单细胞模型中均优于标准和更复杂的掩码方案，提升了最先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: 理论框架揭示了掩码预训练的新特性，R²MAE作为一种简单有效的预训练方案，能够持续提升模型性能。

Abstract: Mask-based pretraining has become a cornerstone of modern large-scale models
across language, vision, and recently biology. Despite its empirical success,
its role and limits in learning data representations have been unclear. In this
work, we show that the behavior of mask-based pretraining can be directly
characterized by test risk in high-dimensional minimum-norm ("ridge-less")
linear regression, without relying on further model specifications. Further
analysis of linear models uncovers several novel aspects of mask-based
pretraining. The theoretical framework and its implications have been validated
across diverse neural architectures (including MLPs, CNNs, and Transformers)
applied to both vision and language tasks. Guided by our theory, we propose an
embarrassingly simple yet overlooked pretraining scheme named Randomly Random
Mask AutoEncoding (R$^2$MAE), which enforces capturing multi-scale features
from data and is able to outperform optimal fixed mask ratio settings in our
linear model framework. We implement R$^2$MAE in vision, language, DNA
sequence, and single-cell models, where it consistently outperforms standard
and more complicated masking schemes, leading to improvements for
state-of-the-art models. Our code is available at:

### [100] [Limitations on Safe, Trusted, Artificial General Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21654)
*Rina Panigrahy,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了安全、信任和AGI的严格数学定义，并证明了它们之间的基本不兼容性：一个安全且受信任的AI系统不能是AGI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为人工智能系统中的安全、信任和AGI这些非正式概念提供严格的数学定义，并探索它们之间的基本关系。

Method: 通过数学定义和形式化证明，将安全定义为系统从不做出错误声明，信任定义为假设系统是安全的，AGI定义为AI系统始终匹配或超过人类能力。

Result: 证明了对于这些形式化定义，安全且受信任的AI系统不能是AGI系统——存在人类可以轻松解决但系统无法解决的任务实例。

Conclusion: 安全、信任和AGI在严格数学定义下存在根本性不兼容，这一结果与哥德尔不完备定理和图灵停机问题不可判定性的证明有相似之处。

Abstract: Safety, trust and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are aspirational
goals in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and there are several informal
interpretations of these notions. In this paper, we propose strict,
mathematical definitions of safety, trust, and AGI, and demonstrate a
fundamental incompatibility between them. We define safety of a system as the
property that it never makes any false claims, trust as the assumption that the
system is safe, and AGI as the property of an AI system always matching or
exceeding human capability. Our core finding is that -- for our formal
definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI
system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are
easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system. We note that we
consider strict mathematical definitions of safety and trust, and it is
possible for real-world deployments to instead rely on alternate, practical
interpretations of these notions. We show our results for program verification,
planning, and graph reachability. Our proofs draw parallels to G\"odel's
incompleteness theorems and Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting
problem, and can be regarded as interpretations of G\"odel's and Turing's
results.

TL;DR: DriftLite是一种轻量级、无需训练的方法，通过最优稳定性控制实时引导扩散模型的推理动态，在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于引导的方法简单但引入偏差，而基于粒子的校正方法存在权重退化和高计算成本问题，需要一种更优的推理时缩放方法。

Method: 利用Fokker-Planck方程中漂移和粒子势能之间未被探索的自由度，开发了方差控制引导(VCG)和能量控制引导(ECG)两种实例化方法。

Result: 在高斯混合模型、粒子系统和大规模蛋白质-配体共折叠问题中，DriftLite一致地减少了方差并提高了样本质量。

Conclusion: DriftLite为扩散模型的推理时适应提供了一条原则性、高效的可扩展路径。

Abstract: We study inference-time scaling for diffusion models, where the goal is to
adapt a pre-trained model to new target distributions without retraining.
Existing guidance-based methods are simple but introduce bias, while
particle-based corrections suffer from weight degeneracy and high computational
cost. We introduce DriftLite, a lightweight, training-free particle-based
approach that steers the inference dynamics on the fly with provably optimal
stability control. DriftLite exploits a previously unexplored degree of freedom
in the Fokker-Planck equation between the drift and particle potential, and
yields two practical instantiations: Variance- and Energy-Controlling Guidance
(VCG/ECG) for approximating the optimal drift with minimal overhead. Across
Gaussian mixture models, particle systems, and large-scale protein-ligand
co-folding problems, DriftLite consistently reduces variance and improves
sample quality over pure guidance and sequential Monte Carlo baselines. These
results highlight a principled, efficient route toward scalable inference-time
adaptation of diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分结构学习框架，能够捕捉离散变量间的任意依赖关系，避免了现有方法对特定结构方程模型的假设限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据可微分结构学习方法通常假设数据来自特定结构方程模型，这些假设可能与真实数据生成过程不符，且往往忽略离散数据的复杂依赖结构，只考虑线性效应。

Method: 将学习问题表述为最一般形式的单一可微分优化任务，避免先前方法采用的不现实简化。能够表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法能有效捕捉离散数据中的复杂关系。

Conclusion: 尽管一般离散模型从纯观测数据中是不可识别的，但在温和假设下可以建立到马尔可夫等价类的可识别性，且能够表征兼容参数和结构的完整集合。

Abstract: Existing methods for differentiable structure learning in discrete data
typically assume that the data are generated from specific structural equation
models. However, these assumptions may not align with the true data-generating
process, which limits the general applicability of such methods. Furthermore,
current approaches often ignore the complex dependence structure inherent in
discrete data and consider only linear effects. We propose a differentiable
structure learning framework that is capable of capturing arbitrary
dependencies among discrete variables. We show that although general discrete
models are unidentifiable from purely observational data, it is possible to
characterize the complete set of compatible parameters and structures.
Additionally, we establish identifiability up to Markov equivalence under mild
assumptions. We formulate the learning problem as a single differentiable
optimization task in the most general form, thereby avoiding the unrealistic
simplifications adopted by previous methods. Empirical results demonstrate that
our approach effectively captures complex relationships in discrete data.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-governed inverse problems are fundamental
across various scientific and engineering applications; yet they face
significant challenges due to nonlinearity, ill-posedness, and sensitivity to
noise. Here, we introduce a new computational framework, RED-DiffEq, by
integrating physics-driven inversion and data-driven learning. RED-DiffEq
leverages pretrained diffusion models as a regularization mechanism for
PDE-governed inverse problems. We apply RED-DiffEq to solve the full waveform
inversion problem in geophysics, a challenging seismic imaging technique that
seeks to reconstruct high-resolution subsurface velocity models from seismic
measurement data. Our method shows enhanced accuracy and robustness compared to
conventional methods. Additionally, it exhibits strong generalization ability
to more complex velocity models that the diffusion model is not trained on. Our
framework can also be directly applied to diverse PDE-governed inverse
problems.

Abstract: Treatment effect estimation is essential for informed decision-making in many
fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. While flexible machine
learning models have been widely applied for estimating heterogeneous treatment
effects, quantifying the inherent uncertainty of their point predictions
remains an issue. Recent advancements in conformal prediction address this
limitation by allowing for inexpensive computation, as well as distribution
shifts, while still providing frequentist, finite-sample coverage guarantees
under minimal assumptions for any point-predictor model. This advancement holds
significant potential for improving decision-making in especially high-stakes
environments. In this work, we perform a systematic review regarding conformal
prediction methods for treatment effect estimation and provide for both the
necessary theoretical background. Through a systematic filtering process, we
select and analyze eleven key papers, identifying and describing current
state-of-the-art methods in this area. Based on our findings, we propose
directions for future research.

Conclusion: MMPlanner通过显式对象状态建模和综合评估协议，在多模态程序规划任务中实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Multimodal Procedural Planning (MPP) aims to generate step-by-step
instructions that combine text and images, with the central challenge of
preserving object-state consistency across modalities while producing
informative plans. Existing approaches often leverage large language models
(LLMs) to refine textual steps; however, visual object-state alignment and
systematic evaluation are largely underexplored. We present MMPlanner, a
zero-shot MPP framework that introduces Object State Reasoning Chain-of-Thought
(OSR-CoT) prompting to explicitly model object-state transitions and generate
accurate multimodal plans. To assess plan quality, we design LLM-as-a-judge
protocols for planning accuracy and cross-modal alignment, and further propose
a visual step-reordering task to measure temporal coherence. Experiments on
RECIPEPLAN and WIKIPLAN show that MMPlanner achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving textual planning by +6.8%, cross-modal alignment by
+11.9%, and visual step ordering by +26.7%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号集成领域存在两种方法：将手工规则注入神经网络模型，或从数据中归纳符号规则。需要一种统一框架来灵活整合数据驱动的规则学习和符号先验知识。

Method: 扩展命题逻辑语法，引入具有可学习参数的选择运算符，可以从选项池中选择子公式。使用模糊逻辑将LoH公式编译为可微分计算图，通过反向传播学习最优选择。

Result: 在表格数据和Visual Tic-Tac-Toe神经符号任务上取得了强劲结果，同时产生可解释的决策规则。模型可以离散化为硬布尔值函数而不会损失性能。

Conclusion: LoH框架统一了神经符号集成的两种主要方法，支持灵活的知识规范，同时保持可解释性和高性能。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic integration (NeSy) blends neural-network learning with symbolic
reasoning. The field can be split between methods injecting hand-crafted rules
into neural models, and methods inducing symbolic rules from data. We introduce
Logic of Hypotheses (LoH), a novel language that unifies these strands,
enabling the flexible integration of data-driven rule learning with symbolic
priors and expert knowledge. LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a
choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a
pool of options. Using fuzzy logic, formulas in LoH can be directly compiled
into a differentiable computational graph, so the optimal choices can be
learned via backpropagation. This framework subsumes some existing NeSy models,
while adding the possibility of arbitrary degrees of knowledge specification.
Moreover, the use of Goedel fuzzy logic and the recently developed Goedel trick
yields models that can be discretized to hard Boolean-valued functions without
any loss in performance. We provide experimental analysis on such models,
showing strong results on tabular data and on the Visual Tic-Tac-Toe NeSy task,
while producing interpretable decision rules.

Conclusion: DIM通过应用领域知识的单调性约束来正则化模型行为并减轻过拟合，从而提高了深度神经网络的预测性能

Abstract: While deep learning models excel at predictive tasks, they often overfit due
to their complex structure and large number of parameters, causing them to
memorize training data, including noise, rather than learn patterns that
generalize to new data. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new
regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep
Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships
in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically,
our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear
baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while
preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a
comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference,
measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements
into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology
using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically
created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show
that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model
performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by
applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior
and mitigate overfitting

Abstract: High-resolution neural datasets enable foundation models for the next
generation of brain-computer interfaces and neurological treatments. The
community requires rigorous benchmarks to discriminate between competing
modeling approaches, yet no standardized evaluation frameworks exist for
intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. To address this gap, we present Neuroprobe:
a suite of decoding tasks for studying multi-modal language processing in the
brain. Unlike scalp EEG, intracranial EEG requires invasive surgery to implant
electrodes that record neural activity directly from the brain with minimal
signal distortion. Neuroprobe is built on the BrainTreebank dataset, which
consists of 40 hours of iEEG recordings from 10 human subjects performing a
naturalistic movie viewing task. Neuroprobe serves two critical functions.
First, it is a mine from which neuroscience insights can be drawn. Its high
temporal and spatial resolution allows researchers to systematically determine
when and where computations for each aspect of language processing occur in the
brain by measuring the decodability of each feature across time and all
electrode locations. Using Neuroprobe, we visualize how information flows from
the superior temporal gyrus to the prefrontal cortex, and the progression from
simple auditory features to more complex language features in a purely
data-driven manner. Second, as the field moves toward neural foundation models,
Neuroprobe provides a rigorous framework for comparing competing architectures
and training protocols. We found that the linear baseline is surprisingly
strong, beating frontier foundation models on many tasks. Neuroprobe is
designed with computational efficiency and ease of use in mind. We make the
code for Neuroprobe openly available and maintain a public leaderboard, aiming
to enable rapid progress in the field of iEEG foundation models, at
https://neuroprobe.dev/

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers are used for a wide range of applications, such as
gesture recognition, gait analysis, and sports monitoring. Yet most existing
foundation models focus primarily on classifying common daily activities such
as locomotion and exercise, limiting their applicability to the broader range
of tasks that rely on other signal characteristics. We present SlotFM, an
accelerometer foundation model that generalizes across diverse downstream
tasks. SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot
Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw
signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing
different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most
relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that
capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of
fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant
information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream
tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms
existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves
comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks. On
average, our method yields a 4.5% performance gain, demonstrating strong
generalization for sensing foundation models.

Method: 将K-means问题重新表述为光滑无约束优化问题，利用黎曼几何结构，采用二阶立方正则化黎曼牛顿算法，并通过流形分解使每个牛顿子问题能在线性时间内求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法比最先进的一阶非负低秩分解方法收敛速度快得多，同时达到相似的统计最优精度。

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼优化方法为K-means聚类提供了高效的二阶算法，在收敛速度和统计精度方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Clustering is a hard discrete optimization problem. Nonconvex approaches such
as low-rank semidefinite programming (SDP) have recently demonstrated promising
statistical and local algorithmic guarantees for cluster recovery. Due to the
combinatorial structure of the $K$-means clustering problem, current relaxation
algorithms struggle to balance their constraint feasibility and objective
optimality, presenting tremendous challenges in computing the second-order
critical points with rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we provide a new
formulation of the $K$-means problem as a smooth unconstrained optimization
over a submanifold and characterize its Riemannian structures to allow it to be
solved using a second-order cubic-regularized Riemannian Newton algorithm. By
factorizing the $K$-means manifold into a product manifold, we show how each
Newton subproblem can be solved in linear time. Our numerical experiments show
that the proposed method converges significantly faster than the
state-of-the-art first-order nonnegative low-rank factorization method, while
achieving similarly optimal statistical accuracy.

TL;DR: Prophecy是一个自动推断前馈神经网络形式属性的工具，通过分析隐藏层神经元激活状态来提取规则，这些规则作为前提条件可推导出期望的输出属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于观察发现前馈神经网络的大部分逻辑体现在内部层神经元的激活状态中，希望通过自动提取这些激活规则来形式化地理解和验证神经网络的行为。

Method: 通过提取基于神经元激活状态（数值或开关状态）的规则作为前提条件，这些规则表示隐藏层捕获的网络属性，能够推导出期望的输出行为。

Result: 开发了Prophecy工具架构，展示了在不同类型模型和输出属性上的应用，包括形式化解释、组合验证、运行时监控、修复等应用场景。

Conclusion: Prophecy在大型视觉语言模型时代具有重要潜力，能够为神经网络提供形式化分析和验证能力。

Abstract: We present Prophecy, a tool for automatically inferring formal properties of
feed-forward neural networks. Prophecy is based on the observation that a
significant part of the logic of feed-forward networks is captured in the
activation status of the neurons at inner layers. Prophecy works by extracting
rules based on neuron activations (values or on/off statuses) as preconditions
that imply certain desirable output property, e.g., the prediction being a
certain class. These rules represent network properties captured in the hidden
layers that imply the desired output behavior. We present the architecture of
the tool, highlight its features and demonstrate its usage on different types
of models and output properties. We present an overview of its applications,
such as inferring and proving formal explanations of neural networks,
compositional verification, run-time monitoring, repair, and others. We also
show novel results highlighting its potential in the era of large
vision-language models.

TL;DR: SpecMER是一种通过k-mer引导的推测解码框架，在蛋白质序列生成中结合生物先验知识，在保持效率的同时显著提高序列合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在蛋白质工程中生成新序列时存在延迟问题，且传统推测解码方法忽视蛋白质的结构功能约束，导致生物不合理输出和似然分布偏移。

Method: 使用从多序列比对中提取的k-mer模体，结合生物、结构和功能先验，并行评分候选序列并选择最符合已知生物模式的序列。

Result: SpecMER相比标准自回归解码实现24-32%的加速，同时具有更高的接受率和改进的序列似然性。

Conclusion: SpecMER框架成功地将生物先验知识整合到推测解码中，在保持生成效率的同时显著提高了蛋白质序列的生物学合理性。

Abstract: Autoregressive models have transformed protein engineering by enabling the
generation of novel protein sequences beyond those found in nature. However,
their sequential inference introduces significant latency, limiting their
utility in high-throughput protein screening. Speculative decoding accelerates
generation by employing a lightweight draft model to sample tokens, which a
larger target model then verifies and refines. Yet, in protein sequence
generation, draft models are typically agnostic to the structural and
functional constraints of the target protein, leading to biologically
implausible outputs and a shift in the likelihood distribution of generated
sequences. We introduce SpecMER (Speculative Decoding via k-mer Guidance), a
novel framework that incorporates biological, structural, and functional priors
using k-mer motifs extracted from multiple sequence alignments. By scoring
candidate sequences in parallel and selecting those most consistent with known
biological patterns, SpecMER significantly improves sequence plausibility while
retaining the efficiency of speculative decoding. SpecMER achieves 24-32%
speedup over standard autoregressive decoding, along with higher acceptance
rates and improved sequence likelihoods.

*Saurabh Kataria,Davood Fattahi,Minxiao Wang,Ran Xiao,Matthew Clark,Timothy Ruchti,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种正交改进方法，通过使用最小辅助信息来提升仅基于PPG的心脏骤停预测系统性能，包括时间到事件建模、患者身份不变性特征学习和基于预训练辅助网络的伪标签回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生理基础模型（如PPG-GPT）虽然能够预测心脏骤停等关键事件，但其强大表示能力在下游数据/标签稀缺时未能充分利用。需要改进PPG-only系统以更好地利用有限信息。

Method: 1. 时间到事件建模：通过简单回归到事件发生时间或精细离散生存建模；2. 患者身份不变性特征学习：训练大规模去标识生物特征识别模型（p-vector），并对其使用对抗性训练来消除可能导致过拟合的身份线索；3. 伪标签回归：使用预训练辅助网络生成伪连续估计作为目标，丰富心脏骤停波形标签。

Result: 提出的方法能够独立地将24小时时间平均AUC从0.74提升到0.78-0.80范围，主要改善了较长时域的预测性能，在事件附近仅有最小退化，推动了早期预警系统研究。

Conclusion: 通过多任务公式化并采用PCGrad优化技术缓解竞争损失间的高梯度冲突，成功提升了PPG-only心脏骤停预测系统的性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下。

Abstract: High-frequency physiological waveform modality offers deep, real-time
insights into patient status. Recently, physiological foundation models based
on Photoplethysmography (PPG), such as PPG-GPT, have been shown to predict
critical events, including Cardiac Arrest (CA). However, their powerful
representation still needs to be leveraged suitably, especially when the
downstream data/label is scarce. We offer three orthogonal improvements to
improve PPG-only CA systems by using minimal auxiliary information. First, we
propose to use time-to-event modeling, either through simple regression to the
event onset time or by pursuing fine-grained discrete survival modeling.
Second, we encourage the model to learn CA-focused features by making them
patient-identity invariant. This is achieved by first training the
largest-scale de-identified biometric identification model, referred to as the
p-vector, and subsequently using it adversarially to deconfound cues, such as
person identity, that may cause overfitting through memorization. Third, we
propose regression on the pseudo-lab values generated by pre-trained auxiliary
estimator networks. This is crucial since true blood lab measurements, such as
lactate, sodium, troponin, and potassium, are collected sparingly. Via
zero-shot prediction, the auxiliary networks can enrich cardiac arrest waveform
labels and generate pseudo-continuous estimates as targets. Our proposals can
independently improve the 24-hour time-averaged AUC from the 0.74 to the
0.78-0.80 range. We primarily improve over longer time horizons with minimal
degradation near the event, thus pushing the Early Warning System research.
Finally, we pursue multi-task formulation and diagnose it with a high gradient
conflict rate among competing losses, which we alleviate via the PCGrad
optimization technique.

Method: 使用精确子图枚举与神经网络结合，并通过稀疏正则化实现有效的剪枝策略和重要子图识别

Result: EIN相比标准图神经网络模型具有足够高的预测性能，并能通过选定的子图进行后验分析

Conclusion: EIN方法在保持预测性能的同时解决了计算复杂度问题，并提供了良好的可解释性

Abstract: In the graph-level prediction task (predict a label for a given graph), the
information contained in subgraphs of the input graph plays a key role. In this
paper, we propose Exact subgraph Isomorphism Network (EIN), which combines the
exact subgraph enumeration, neural network, and a sparse regularization. In
general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative
ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our
combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high
discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph.
Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective
pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration
while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important
subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that
EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph
neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on
the selected subgraphs.

Conclusion: 该方法为改进交通服务和城市发展提供了分析进步和实际应用。

Abstract: Understanding urban human mobility patterns at various spatial levels is
essential for social science. This study presents a machine learning framework
to downscale origin-destination (OD) taxi trips flows in New York City from a
larger spatial unit to a smaller spatial unit. First, correlations between OD
trips and demographic, socioeconomic, and commuting characteristics are
developed using four models: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks (NN). Second, a
perturbation-based sensitivity analysis is applied to interpret variable
importance for nonlinear models. The results show that the linear regression
model failed to capture the complex variable interactions. While NN performs
best with the training and testing datasets, SVM shows the best generalization
ability in downscaling performance. The methodology presented in this study
provides both analytical advancement and practical applications to improve
transportation services and urban development.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性挑战全局模型性能，传统方法依赖全局训练后本地适配，需要更早阶段的质量控制方法。

Method: 从客户端原始数据提取代表性特征，应用聚类技术估计客户端间数据集相似度，基于相似度实施客户端选择策略，让客户端与数据分布兼容的其他客户端协作。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MNIST数据集上测试，与三种现有联邦学习算法集成，PQFed持续提升目标客户端模型性能，在参与者有限情况下表现优异，在低参与度场景中优于IFCA基线算法。

Conclusion: PQFed在个性化联邦学习设置中展现出良好的可扩展性和有效性，通过早期质量控制和智能客户端选择解决了数据异构性问题。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training without sharing raw
data, but data heterogeneity consistently challenges the performance of the
global model. Traditional optimization methods often rely on collaborative
global model training involving all clients, followed by local adaptation to
improve individual performance. In this work, we focus on early-stage quality
control and propose PQFed, a novel privacy-preserving personalized federated
learning framework that designs customized training strategies for each client
prior to the federated training process. PQFed extracts representative features
from each client's raw data and applies clustering techniques to estimate
inter-client dataset similarity. Based on these similarity estimates, the
framework implements a client selection strategy that enables each client to
collaborate with others who have compatible data distributions. We evaluate
PQFed on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10 and MNIST, integrated with three
existing federated learning algorithms. Experimental results show that PQFed
consistently improves the target client's model performance, even with a
limited number of participants. We further benchmark PQFed against a baseline
cluster-based algorithm, IFCA, and observe that PQFed also achieves better
performance in low-participation scenarios. These findings highlight PQFed's
scalability and effectiveness in personalized federated learning settings.

Conclusion: 该框架为并行化序列模型提供了更清晰的理论基础，并指出了高效可扩展计算的新方向。

Abstract: Harnessing parallelism in seemingly sequential models is a central challenge
for modern machine learning. Several approaches have been proposed for
evaluating sequential processes in parallel using fixed-point methods, like
Newton, Picard, and Jacobi iterations. In this work, we show that these methods
can be understood within a common framework based on linear dynamical systems
(LDSs), where different iteration schemes arise naturally as approximate
linearizations of a nonlinear recursion. This unifying view highlights shared
principles behind these techniques and clarifies when particular fixed-point
methods are most likely to be effective. By bridging diverse algorithms through
the language of LDSs, our framework provides a clearer theoretical foundation
for parallelizing sequential models and points toward new opportunities for
efficient and scalable computation.

Motivation: 双层优化问题具有复杂的嵌套结构，其中下层问题的最优性定义了上层问题的约束。由于这种复杂性，相比于多目标或约束设置等标准扩展，贝叶斯优化在双层优化中的应用尚未得到广泛研究。

Method: 采用信息论方法，同时考虑上层和下层最优解和最优值的信息增益，定义了一个统一标准来衡量两个层次问题的收益。还展示了基于实际下界的方法来评估信息增益。

Result: 通过在多个基准数据集上的实证研究，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的信息论方法能够有效处理涉及昂贵黑箱函数的双层优化问题，为这一复杂优化场景提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: A bilevel optimization problem consists of two optimization problems nested
as an upper- and a lower-level problem, in which the optimality of the
lower-level problem defines a constraint for the upper-level problem. This
paper considers Bayesian optimization (BO) for the case that both the upper-
and lower-levels involve expensive black-box functions. Because of its nested
structure, bilevel optimization has a complex problem definition and, compared
with other standard extensions of BO such as multi-objective or constraint
settings, it has not been widely studied. We propose an information-theoretic
approach that considers the information gain of both the upper- and
lower-optimal solutions and values. This enables us to define a unified
criterion that measures the benefit for both level problems, simultaneously.
Further, we also show a practical lower bound based approach to evaluating the
information gain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method through several benchmark datasets.

Result: 在OASIS-3和ADNI两个独立队列上验证有效，识别出海马旁皮层、前额叶皮层和顶叶小叶等关键区域，以及腹侧注意、背侧注意和默认模式网络的显著中断，这些异常与纵向AD相关临床症状密切相关。

Conclusion: 时空图学习方法在早期个体化预测AD进展方面具有潜力，即使在纵向成像数据不规则采样的背景下也能有效工作，揭示了已建立和新颖的神经系统水平及性别特异性生物标志物。

Abstract: Identifying objective neuroimaging biomarkers to forecast Alzheimer's disease
(AD) progression is crucial for timely intervention. However, this task remains
challenging due to the complex dysfunctions in the spatio-temporal
characteristics of underlying brain networks, which are often overlooked by
existing methods. To address these limitations, we develop an interpretable
spatio-temporal graph neural network framework to predict future AD
progression, leveraging dual Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to model
the irregularly-sampled longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data. We validate our approach on two independent cohorts, including the
Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) and the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our framework effectively learns sparse
regional and connective importance probabilities, enabling the identification
of key brain circuit abnormalities associated with disease progression.
Notably, we detect the parahippocampal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and parietal
lobule as salient regions, with significant disruptions in the ventral
attention, dorsal attention, and default mode networks. These abnormalities
correlate strongly with longitudinal AD-related clinical symptoms. Moreover,
our interpretability strategy reveals both established and novel neural
systems-level and sex-specific biomarkers, offering new insights into the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying AD progression. Our findings highlight
the potential of spatio-temporal graph-based learning for early, individualized
prediction of AD progression, even in the context of irregularly-sampled
longitudinal imaging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物先导化合物优化方法样本效率低下，难以在有限的评估次数内实现良好优化。大语言模型具有上下文学习和指令跟随能力，但现有方法未能充分利用这一优势。

Method: 提出POLO框架，核心是偏好引导策略优化(PGPO)算法，包含轨迹级优化和轮级偏好学习两个互补层次：轨迹级强化成功策略，轮级通过比较中间分子排名提供密集反馈。

Result: POLO在单属性任务上达到84%的平均成功率（比基线方法高2.3倍），在多属性任务上达到50%成功率，仅使用500次评估，显著推进了样本效率分子优化的最先进水平。

Conclusion: POLO通过从完整优化轨迹中学习，充分利用每次昂贵的评估，实现了卓越的样本效率，为药物发现中的先导化合物优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Lead optimization in drug discovery requires efficiently navigating vast
chemical space through iterative cycles to enhance molecular properties while
preserving structural similarity to the original lead compound. Despite recent
advances, traditional optimization methods struggle with sample
efficiency-achieving good optimization performance with limited oracle
evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising approach through
their in-context learning and instruction following capabilities, which align
naturally with these iterative processes. However, existing LLM-based methods
fail to leverage this strength, treating each optimization step independently.
To address this, we present POLO (Preference-guided multi-turn Optimization for
Lead Optimization), which enables LLMs to learn from complete optimization
trajectories rather than isolated steps. At its core, POLO introduces
Preference-Guided Policy Optimization (PGPO), a novel reinforcement learning
algorithm that extracts learning signals at two complementary levels:
trajectory-level optimization reinforces successful strategies, while
turn-level preference learning provides dense comparative feedback by ranking
intermediate molecules within each trajectory. Through this dual-level learning
from intermediate evaluation, POLO achieves superior sample efficiency by fully
exploiting each costly oracle call. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POLO
achieves 84% average success rate on single-property tasks (2.3x better than
baselines) and 50% on multi-property tasks using only 500 oracle evaluations,
significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in sample-efficient molecular
optimization.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，BrainPoG在模型性能和计算效率方面均表现出优越性

Conclusion: BrainPoG能够专门学习信息丰富的疾病相关知识，避免不相关信息，实现高效的脑图学习

Abstract: Brain graph learning has demonstrated significant achievements in the fields
of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. However, existing methods struggle
to selectively learn disease-related knowledge, leading to heavy parameters and
computational costs. This challenge diminishes their efficiency, as well as
limits their practicality for real-world clinical applications. To this end, we
propose a lightweight Brain PathoGraph Learning (BrainPoG) model that enables
efficient brain graph learning by pathological pattern filtering and
pathological feature distillation. Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a
filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly
disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A
PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs
from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation
module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance
pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively
learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant
information, achieving efficient brain graph learning. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets demonstrate that BrainPoG exhibits superiority in both
model performance and computational efficiency across various brain disease
detection tasks.

Conclusion: HyperCore能有效丢弃错误标注和模糊点，产生紧凑且信息丰富的子集，适用于可扩展和无噪声学习。

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection methods is to identify representative subsets
of datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing methods often ignore
the possibility of annotation errors and require fixed pruning ratios, making
them impractical in real-world settings. We present HyperCore, a robust and
adaptive coreset selection framework designed explicitly for noisy
environments. HyperCore leverages lightweight hypersphere models learned per
class, embedding in-class samples close to a hypersphere center while naturally
segregating out-of-class samples based on their distance. By using Youden's J
statistic, HyperCore can adaptively select pruning thresholds, enabling
automatic, noise-aware data pruning without hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments reveal that HyperCore consistently surpasses state-of-the-art
coreset selection methods, especially under noisy and low-data regimes.
HyperCore effectively discards mislabeled and ambiguous points, yielding
compact yet highly informative subsets suitable for scalable and noise-free

Abstract: The goal of coreset selection is to identify representative subsets of
datasets for efficient model training. Yet, existing approaches paradoxically
require expensive training-based signals, e.g., gradients, decision boundary
estimates or forgetting counts, computed over the entire dataset prior to
pruning, which undermines their very purpose by requiring training on samples
they aim to avoid. We introduce SubZeroCore, a novel, training-free coreset
selection method that integrates submodular coverage and density into a single,
unified objective. To achieve this, we introduce a sampling strategy based on a
closed-form solution to optimally balance these objectives, guided by a single
hyperparameter that explicitly controls the desired coverage for local density
measures. Despite no training, extensive evaluations show that SubZeroCore
matches training-based baselines and significantly outperforms them at high
pruning rates, while dramatically reducing computational overhead. SubZeroCore
also demonstrates superior robustness to label noise, highlighting its
practical effectiveness and scalability for real-world scenarios.

*Jaemin Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于神经场的4DVAR重构方法，将时空状态表示为神经网络参数化的连续函数，实现并行时间优化，降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4DVAR成本函数难以优化且计算密集，需要改进优化效率和计算性能。

Method: 使用神经网络参数化时空状态为连续函数，通过物理约束损失函数直接整合物理规律，实现并行时间优化。

Result: 在二维不可压缩Navier-Stokes方程测试中，相比基线4DVAR，该方法产生更稳定的初始条件估计，无虚假振荡。

Conclusion: 该方法无需真实状态或再分析数据，在参考信息有限的情况下具有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) is a cornerstone of
numerical weather prediction, but its cost function is difficult to optimize
and computationally intensive. We propose a neural field-based reformulation in
which the full spatiotemporal state is represented as a continuous function
parameterized by a neural network. This reparameterization removes the
time-sequential dependency of classical 4DVAR, enabling parallel-in-time
optimization in parameter space. Physical constraints are incorporated directly
through a physics-informed loss, simplifying implementation and reducing
computational cost. We evaluate the method on the two-dimensional
incompressible Navier--Stokes equations with Kolmogorov forcing. Compared to a
baseline 4DVAR implementation, the neural reparameterized variants produce more
stable initial condition estimates without spurious oscillations. Notably,
unlike most machine learning-based approaches, our framework does not require
access to ground-truth states or reanalysis data, broadening its applicability
to settings with limited reference information.

TL;DR: 使用fNIRS和机器学习检测多发性硬化症患者手部灵巧任务中的脑活动生物标志物，发现上缘/角回和中央前回活动抑制及神经血管反应减慢，分类准确率达75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症患者常报告手部灵巧性和认知疲劳问题，但损伤往往细微难以检测。研究旨在发现能解释主观认知疲劳报告的脑活动生物标志物，为未来脑刺激治疗提供靶点。

Method: 招募15名无手部、活动或认知障碍的多发性硬化症患者和12名匹配对照，完成单任务和双任务手部灵巧测试，使用fNIRS测量双侧前额叶和感觉运动皮层脑血流动力学反应，应用机器学习框架分析数据。

Result: K-近邻分类器对单任务分类准确率75.0%，双任务66.7%。XAI显示最重要的脑区为上缘/角回和中央前回，多发性硬化组活动抑制且神经血管反应减慢。脱氧血红蛋白比常规氧合血红蛋白是更好的预测指标。

Conclusion: 这种非常规fNIRS数据分析方法揭示了新的脑活动生物标志物，有助于开发个性化脑刺激靶点。

Abstract: People with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) complain of problems with hand dexterity
and cognitive fatigue. However, in many cases, impairments are subtle and
difficult to detect. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a
non-invasive neuroimaging technique that measures brain hemodynamic responses
during cognitive or motor tasks. We aimed to detect brain activity biomarkers
that could explain subjective reports of cognitive fatigue while completing
dexterous tasks and provide targets for future brain stimulation treatments. We
recruited 15 people with MS who did not have a hand (Nine Hole Peg Test
[NHPT]), mobility, or cognitive impairment, and 12 age- and sex-matched
controls. Participants completed two types of hand dexterity tasks with their
dominant hand, single task and dual task (NHPT while holding a ball between the
fifth finger and hypothenar eminence of the same hand). We analyzed fNIRS data
(oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels) using a machine learning
framework to classify MS patients from controls based on their brain activation
patterns in bilateral prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. The K-Nearest
Neighbor classifier achieved an accuracy of 75.0% for single manual dexterity
tasks and 66.7% for the more complex dual manual dexterity tasks. Using XAI, we
found that the most important brain regions contributing to the machine
learning model were the supramarginal/angular gyri and the precentral gyrus
(sensory integration and motor regions) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, with
suppressed activity and slower neurovascular response in the MS group. During
both tasks, deoxygenated hemoglobin levels were better predictors than the
conventional measure of oxygenated hemoglobin. This nonconventional method of
fNIRS data analysis revealed novel brain activity biomarkers that can help
develop personalized brain stimulation targets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出有效信息准则(EIC)来衡量符号回归公式的结构合理性，通过分析公式在有限计算精度下的数值稳定性来评估可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法仅使用复杂度指标作为可解释性代理，忽略了公式的数学结构合理性，导致发现的公式难以分析解释。

Method: 将公式视为具有特定内部结构的信息处理系统，通过观察数据流经系统时的有效数字损失或舍入噪声放大来识别不合理结构。

Result: EIC提高了搜索型算法的帕累托前沿性能，减少了不合理结构；使生成型算法的样本效率提升2-4倍；与人类专家对公式可解释性的偏好有70.2%的一致性。

Conclusion: EIC通过衡量公式中的不合理结构，能够有效反映公式的可解释性，为符号回归提供了更好的结构合理性评估标准。

Abstract: Symbolic regression discovers accurate and interpretable formulas to describe
given data, thereby providing scientific insights for domain experts and
promoting scientific discovery. However, existing symbolic regression methods
often use complexity metrics as a proxy for interoperability, which only
considers the size of the formula but ignores its internal mathematical
structure. Therefore, while they can discover formulas with compact forms, the
discovered formulas often have structures that are difficult to analyze or
interpret mathematically. In this work, inspired by the observation that
physical formulas are typically numerically stable under limited calculation
precision, we propose the Effective Information Criterion (EIC). It treats
formulas as information processing systems with specific internal structures
and identifies the unreasonable structure in them by the loss of significant
digits or the amplification of rounding noise as data flows through the system.
We find that this criterion reveals the gap between the structural rationality
of models discovered by existing symbolic regression algorithms and real-world
physical formulas. Combining EIC with various search-based symbolic regression
algorithms improves their performance on the Pareto frontier and reduces the
irrational structure in the results. Combining EIC with generative-based
algorithms reduces the number of samples required for pre-training, improving
sample efficiency by 2~4 times. Finally, for different formulas with similar
accuracy and complexity, EIC shows a 70.2% agreement with 108 human experts'
preferences for formula interpretability, demonstrating that EIC, by measuring
the unreasonable structures in formulas, actually reflects the formula's
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种并发感知的推测解码框架，用于加速GRPO训练过程，通过动态调整草稿和验证策略，并结合在线草稿学习机制，实现了2.35-2.72倍的端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在提升大语言模型推理能力方面潜力巨大，但其训练过程过于缓慢，主要瓶颈在于每个查询需要自回归生成多个响应，计算成本高昂。虽然推测解码提供了加速方向，但在高并发训练条件下直接应用效果有限。

Method: 提出并发感知的推测解码框架，根据实时并发水平动态调整草稿和验证策略；引入在线草稿学习机制，使草稿模型能够根据目标模型的反馈信号持续适应，解决训练过程中分布漂移问题。

Result: 在多个数学推理数据集和模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了2.35倍到2.72倍的端到端加速，在效率上显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的并发感知推测解码框架和在线草稿学习机制有效解决了GRPO训练中的性能瓶颈，大幅提升了训练效率，为强化学习在大语言模型中的应用提供了实用的加速方案。

Abstract: Group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated significant
potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) via reinforcement learning. However, its practical deployment is impeded
by an excessively slow training process, primarily attributed to the
computationally intensive autoregressive generation of multiple responses per
query, which makes the generation phase the primary performance bottleneck.
Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration,
its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency
training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the
drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels,
thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process. Furthermore, to
address performance degradation arising from distributional drift between the
evolving target model and the fixed draft model during training, we introduce
an online draft learning mechanism that enables the draft model to continuously
adapt using feedback signals from the target model. Experimental results across
multiple mathematical reasoning datasets and models demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves end-to-end speedups of 2.35x to 2.72x, significantly
surpassing baseline approaches in efficiency. The code is available at

Method: 使用DROZY数据集，提取ECG、EMG、EOG和EEG四种生理信号特征，评估15种信号组合，采用决策树、随机森林、逻辑回归和XGBoost四种分类器进行对比分析，并使用SHAP进行特征重要性分析。

Result: XGBoost结合EMG+EEG信号组合取得最佳性能，SHAP分析显示ECG+EOG相关性是关键特征，多信号模型在所有情况下都优于单信号模型。

Abstract: Fatigue detection using physiological signals is critical in domains such as
transportation, healthcare, and performance monitoring. While most studies
focus on single modalities, this work examines statistical relationships
between signal pairs to improve classification robustness. Using the DROZY
dataset, we extracted features from ECG, EMG, EOG, and EEG across 15 signal
combinations and evaluated them with Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, and XGBoost. Results show that XGBoost with the EMG EEG combination
achieved the best performance. SHAP analysis highlighted ECG EOG correlation as
a key feature, and multi signal models consistently outperformed single signal
ones. These findings demonstrate that feature level fusion of physiological
signals enhances accuracy, interpretability, and practical applicability of
fatigue monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混沌系统（如天气预报和流体动力学）对初始条件敏感且观测数据稀缺，传统模型缺乏泛化能力，无法满足零样本或小样本预测的现实需求。

Method: 使用名为ScaleFormer的多尺度架构结合专家混合层，在多样化混沌动力学语料库上进行预训练，捕捉通用模式和系统特定行为。

Result: 在包含9000多个合成混沌系统的大规模测试平台上，长期吸引子统计保真度比领先基线提高40%以上；在5天全球天气预报中实现低于1度的竞争性零样本平均误差，小样本微调后进一步改善。

Conclusion: ChaosNexus的扩展行为为科学基础模型提供了指导原则：跨系统泛化源于训练系统的多样性，而非单纯的数据量。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting chaotic systems, prevalent in domains such as weather
prediction and fluid dynamics, remains a significant scientific challenge. The
inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a
scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling
approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system,
they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications,
which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited
scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a
foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics.
ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented
with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and
system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a
large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it
improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40%
compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world
applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global
weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error
below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning.
Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding
principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems
from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了训练数据、模型规模和计算资源对材料属性预测神经网络性能的影响，发现了经验性的缩放规律，并建立了损失与超参数之间的幂律关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测材料属性对于设计更好的电池、半导体和医疗设备至关重要，深度学习可以帮助科学家快速找到有前景的材料。公司在大规模深度学习模型上投入巨资，因此需要了解如何通过扩展训练数据、模型规模和计算资源来优化性能。

Method: 训练了transformer和EquiformerV2神经网络来预测材料属性，分析了训练数据量、模型规模和计算资源三个超参数对性能的影响，并建立了损失与超参数之间的幂律关系。

Result: 发现了经验性的缩放规律：损失L与相关超参数N之间存在幂律关系L = α·N^(-β)，其中α和β是常数。这意味着可以通过增加训练数据、模型规模或计算资源来系统性地提高预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为材料属性预测中的神经网络缩放提供了实证基础，未来可以进一步研究其他神经网络模型（如GemNet和全连接网络）的缩放规律，并与当前研究的模型进行比较。

Abstract: Predicting material properties is crucial for designing better batteries,
semiconductors, and medical devices. Deep learning helps scientists quickly
find promising materials by predicting their energy, forces, and stresses.
Companies scale capacities of deep learning models in multiple domains, such as
language modeling, and invest many millions of dollars into such models. Our
team analyzes how scaling training data (giving models more information to
learn from), model sizes (giving models more capacity to learn patterns), and
compute (giving models more computational resources) for neural networks
affects their performance for material property prediction. In particular, we
trained both transformer and EquiformerV2 neural networks to predict material
properties. We find empirical scaling laws for these models: we can predict how
increasing each of the three hyperparameters (training data, model size, and
compute) affects predictive performance. In particular, the loss $L$ can be
measured with a power law relationship $L = \alpha \cdot N^{-\beta}$, where
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants while $N$ is the relevant hyperparameter. We
also incorporate command-line arguments for changing training settings such as
the amount of epochs, maximum learning rate, and whether mixed precision is
enabled. Future work could entail further investigating scaling laws for other
neural network models in this domain, such as GemNet and fully connected
networks, to assess how they compare to the models we trained.

Motivation: SAM方法被广泛用于寻找更平坦的最小化点以提升泛化能力，但作者发现该方法可能收敛到不正确的点，即幻觉最小化点。

Method: 通过理论分析证明幻觉最小化点的存在性，建立局部收敛条件，并通过实验验证SAM在实践中确实会收敛到这些点。

Result: 理论证明和实验证据均表明SAM可能收敛到幻觉最小化点，这些点不是原始目标的真正最小化点。

Conclusion: SAM方法存在收敛到幻觉最小化点的风险，作者提出了一种简单有效的修复方法来避免这一问题。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) is a widely used method that steers
training toward flatter minimizers, which typically generalize better. In this
work, however, we show that SAM can converge to hallucinated minimizers --
points that are not minimizers of the original objective. We theoretically
prove the existence of such hallucinated minimizers and establish conditions
for local convergence to them. We further provide empirical evidence
demonstrating that SAM can indeed converge to these points in practice.
Finally, we propose a simple yet effective remedy for avoiding hallucinated
minimizers.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线多智能体强化学习中的稀疏奖励挑战，证明了隐式奖励学习和双优势流机制的有效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in
environments with sparse rewards, where reward feedback is not provided at each
interaction but only revealed at the end of a trajectory. This setting, though
realistic, presents a fundamental challenge: the lack of intermediate rewards
hinders standard MARL algorithms from effectively guiding policy learning. To
address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates online inverse
preference learning with multi-agent on-policy optimization into a unified
architecture. At its core, our approach introduces an implicit multi-agent
reward learning model, built upon a preference-based value-decomposition
network, which produces both global and local reward signals. These signals are
further used to construct dual advantage streams, enabling differentiated
learning targets for the centralized critic and decentralized actors. In
addition, we demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to
provide preference labels that enhance the quality of the learned reward model.
Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art benchmarks, including MAMuJoCo and
SMACv2, show that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing sparse-reward
challenges in online MARL.

Motivation: 现有分析主要关注均匀离散扩散，对掩码离散扩散的理论理解不足，特别是在高维设置下的复杂性分析存在空白。

Method: 分析了Euler采样器在掩码离散扩散中的性能，提出了MATU方法，利用每个token最多被解掩码一次的特性来优化计算复杂度。

Result: Euler采样器可实现ε精度的总变差，MATU方法达到了O(d ln d·(1-ε²))的复杂度，消除了ln(1/ε)因子，显著加速收敛。

Conclusion: 研究为掩码离散扩散提供了严格理论基础，展示了其在文本生成中相对于均匀扩散的实际优势，为基于掩码范式的扩散语言模型分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: We study masked discrete diffusion -- a flexible paradigm for text generation
in which tokens are progressively corrupted by special mask symbols before
being denoised. Although this approach has demonstrated strong empirical
performance, its theoretical complexity in high-dimensional settings remains
insufficiently understood. Existing analyses largely focus on uniform discrete
diffusion, and more recent attempts addressing masked diffusion either (1)
overlook widely used Euler samplers, (2) impose restrictive bounded-score
assumptions, or (3) fail to showcase the advantages of masked discrete
diffusion over its uniform counterpart. To address this gap, we show that Euler
samplers can achieve $\epsilon$-accuracy in total variation (TV) with
$\tilde{O}(d^{2}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ discrete score evaluations, thereby providing
the first rigorous analysis of typical Euler sampler in masked discrete
diffusion. We then propose a Mask-Aware Truncated Uniformization (MATU)
approach that both removes bounded-score assumptions and preserves unbiased
discrete score approximation. By exploiting the property that each token can be
unmasked at most once, MATU attains a nearly $\epsilon$-free complexity of
$O(d\,\ln d\cdot (1-\epsilon^2))$. This result surpasses existing
uniformization methods under uniform discrete diffusion, eliminating the
$\ln(1/\epsilon)$ factor and substantially speeding up convergence. Our
findings not only provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for masked discrete
diffusion, showcasing its practical advantages over uniform diffusion for text
generation, but also pave the way for future efforts to analyze diffusion-based
language models developed under masking paradigm.

Conclusion: 该框架为草图双线性形式提供了统一的几何复杂度依赖分析，在联邦学习和多臂老虎机等应用中实现了更优的性能边界。

Abstract: Uniform bounds on sketched inner products of vectors or matrices underpin
several important computational and statistical results in machine learning and
randomized algorithms, including the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (J-L) lemma, the
Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), randomized sketching, and approximate
linear algebra. However, many modern analyses involve *sketched bilinear
forms*, for which existing uniform bounds either do not apply or are not sharp
on general sets. In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such
sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric
complexities of the associated sets. Our approach relies on generic chaining
and introduces new techniques for handling suprema over pairs of sets. We
further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a
sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as
$\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma
as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain
improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where
such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and
design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that
depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather
than the ambient dimension.

Motivation: 现有模型无关的长上下文建模方法依赖手工设计的多代理协作策略和提示工程，限制了泛化能力，需要更原则性的框架来优化协作结构。

Method: 基于信息论压缩目标，提出Graph of Agents (GoA)框架，动态构建输入依赖的协作结构，最大化压缩目标。

Result: 在六个文档问答基准测试中，GoA将检索增强生成的平均F1分数提升5.7%，比使用固定协作结构的多代理基线提升16.35%。仅使用2K上下文窗口的GoA在LongBench上超越了128K上下文窗口的Llama 3.1 8B。

Conclusion: GoA框架通过原则性的压缩目标显著提升了多代理系统在长上下文建模中的性能，大幅增加了有效上下文长度。

Abstract: As a model-agnostic approach to long context modeling, multi-agent systems
can process inputs longer than a large language model's context window without
retraining or architectural modifications. However, their performance often
heavily relies on hand-crafted multi-agent collaboration strategies and prompt
engineering, which limit generalizability. In this work, we introduce a
principled framework that formalizes the model-agnostic long context modeling
problem as a compression problem, yielding an information-theoretic compression
objective. Building on this framework, we propose Graph of Agents (GoA), which
dynamically constructs an input-dependent collaboration structure that
maximizes this objective. For Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen3 8B across six document
question answering benchmarks, GoA improves the average $F_1$ score of
retrieval-augmented generation by 5.7\% and a strong multi-agent baseline using
a fixed collaboration structure by 16.35\%, respectively. Even with only a 2K
context window, GoA surpasses the 128K context window Llama 3.1 8B on
LongBench, showing a dramatic increase in effective context length. Our source

Abstract: Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular

TL;DR: 提出LDAR方法，通过自适应检索缓解长上下文中的干扰问题，相比直接输入完整文档，在减少token使用的同时显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM上下文窗口增大，直接输入完整文档成为RAG的替代方案，但这种方法存在token效率低、"迷失在中间"现象加剧、模型容量有限时干扰增强等问题

Method: LDAR（学习感知干扰的检索），一种自适应检索器，学习检索能够减轻干扰段落影响的上文

Result: 在多种LLM架构和六个知识密集型基准测试上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: LDAR方法在信息覆盖和干扰之间取得了更好的平衡，相比长上下文方法在减少token使用的同时实现了显著更高的性能

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework for grounding Large
Language Models (LLMs) in external, up-to-date information. However, recent
advancements in context window size allow LLMs to process inputs of up to 128K
tokens or more, offering an alternative strategy: supplying the full document
context directly to the model, rather than relying on RAG to retrieve a subset
of contexts. Nevertheless, this emerging alternative strategy has notable
limitations: (i) it is token-inefficient to handle large and potentially
redundant contexts; (ii) it exacerbates the `lost in the middle' phenomenon;
and (iii) under limited model capacity, it amplifies distraction, ultimately
degrading LLM output quality. In this paper, we propose LDAR (Learning
Distraction-Aware Retrieval), an adaptive retriever that learns to retrieve
contexts in a way that mitigates interference from distracting passages,
thereby achieving significantly higher performance with reduced token usage
compared to long-context approaches. Extensive experiments across diverse LLM
architectures and six knowledge-intensive benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting the importance of
balancing the trade-off between information coverage and distraction.

TL;DR: ILP-CoT结合归纳逻辑编程和多模态大语言模型，用于溯因逻辑规则归纳，通过MLLM提出的规则结构建议自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，有效解决逻辑事实发现和规则归纳的挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 解决单独使用ILP需要指定背景知识且计算成本高，或单独使用MLLMs存在感知幻觉的问题，利用MLLMs即使在幻觉情况下也能提出结构正确规则的特点。

Method: 基于MLLMs提出的规则结构建议自动构建ILP任务并修剪搜索空间，然后使用ILP系统基于修正的逻辑事实和形式归纳推理输出规则。

Result: 在具有挑战性的逻辑归纳基准测试中验证了有效性，并在文本到图像定制生成等应用中展示了潜力。

Conclusion: ILP-CoT成功结合了ILP和MLLMs的优势，为逻辑规则归纳提供了有效的解决方案，并在多个应用场景中展现出良好性能。

Abstract: We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule
induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing
logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs,
which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the
requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or
MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key
observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under
hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search
spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP
system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive
reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction
benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely
text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are

*Chaoyang Luo,Yan Zou,Nanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zubov-Net是一个自适应稳定学习框架，通过将Zubov方程重新表述为吸引域与预设吸引域之间的一致性表征，解决了神经ODE中鲁棒性与准确性的冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经ODE由于其动力学系统特性在输入扰动下具有内在鲁棒性，但现有方法通常需要施加Lyapunov稳定性条件来提供形式化鲁棒性保证。然而，鲁棒性与准确性之间存在根本性冲突，主要源于难以施加适当的稳定性条件。

Method: 提出Zubov-Net框架，通过三方损失（一致性损失、分类损失和分离损失）和并行边界采样算法共同优化神经ODE和Lyapunov函数。设计了基于输入注意力的凸神经网络，通过softmax注意力机制关注平衡点相关特征，并作为权重归一化以保持深度架构中的训练稳定性。

Result: 实验表明，Zubov-Net在保持高分类准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种随机噪声和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 理论上证明了最小化三方损失可以保证预设吸引域-吸引域的一致性对齐、轨迹稳定性和非重叠预设吸引域。建立了具有更紧概率边界和更少维度要求的随机凸可分性，为Lyapunov函数中的凸设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Despite neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) exhibiting
intrinsic robustness under input perturbations due to their dynamical systems
nature, recent approaches often involve imposing Lyapunov-based stability
conditions to provide formal robustness guarantees. However, a fundamental
challenge remains: the tension between robustness and accuracy, primarily
stemming from the difficulty in imposing appropriate stability conditions. To
address this, we propose an adaptive stable learning framework named Zubov-Net,
which innovatively reformulates Zubov's equation into a consistency
characterization between regions of attraction (RoAs) and prescribed RoAs
(PRoAs). Building on this consistency, we introduce a new paradigm for actively
controlling the geometry of RoAs by directly optimizing PRoAs to reconcile
accuracy and robustness. Our approach is realized through tripartite losses
(consistency, classification, and separation losses) and a parallel boundary
sampling algorithm that co-optimizes the Neural ODE and the Lyapunov function.
To enhance the discriminativity of Lyapunov functions, we design an
input-attention-based convex neural network via a softmax attention mechanism
that focuses on equilibrium-relevant features and also serves as weight
normalization to maintain training stability in deep architectures.
Theoretically, we prove that minimizing the tripartite loss guarantees
consistent alignment of PRoAs-RoAs, trajectory stability, and non-overlapping
PRoAs. Moreover, we establish stochastic convex separability with tighter
probability bounds and fewer dimensionality requirements to justify the convex
design in Lyapunov functions. Experimentally, Zubov-Net maintains high
classification accuracy while significantly improving robustness against
various stochastic noises and adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 验证RLVR方法在实际应用中的真实效果，探究其收益是否被高估，以及是否存在隐藏成本（RLVR税）。

Method: 使用部分提示污染审计和匹配预算复现，在基础模型和RL模型间进行对比；提出税收感知的训练评估协议，优化准确性、基础和校准弃权。

Result: 在清洁、对等控制的评估下，多个头条差距缩小或消失；新协议提供了更可靠的推理增益估计，并修正了先前结论。

Conclusion: RLVR具有实际价值且已具备工业应用条件，但需要更可靠的评估方法以确保其可靠性、安全性和可测量性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a practical and
scalable approach to enhancing large language models in areas such as math,
code, and other structured tasks. Two questions motivate this paper: how much
of the reported gains survive under strictly parity-controlled evaluation, and
whether RLVR is cost-free or exacts a measurable tax. We argue that progress is
real, but gains are often overstated due to three forces - an RLVR tax,
evaluation pitfalls, and data contamination. Using a partial-prompt
contamination audit and matched-budget reproductions across base and RL models,
we show that several headline gaps shrink or vanish under clean,
parity-controlled evaluation. We then propose a tax-aware training and
evaluation protocol that co-optimizes accuracy, grounding, and calibrated
abstention and standardizes budgeting and provenance checks. Applied to recent
RLVR setups, this protocol yields more reliable estimates of reasoning gains
and, in several cases, revises prior conclusions. Our position is constructive:
RLVR is valuable and industry-ready; we advocate keeping its practical benefits
while prioritizing reliability, safety, and measurement.

Method: 引入神经网络的代数表示和核函数来构建RKHS，利用Koopman算子理论推导新的复杂度边界。

Result: 得到了适用于更广泛模型类型的Rademacher复杂度边界，能够解释高秩权重矩阵模型的良好泛化性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Koopman理论在更实际场景下的Rademacher复杂度边界应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: We derive a new Rademacher complexity bound for deep neural networks using
Koopman operators, group representations, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHSs). The proposed bound describes why the models with high-rank weight
matrices generalize well. Although there are existing bounds that attempt to
describe this phenomenon, these existing bounds can be applied to limited types
of models. We introduce an algebraic representation of neural networks and a
kernel function to construct an RKHS to derive a bound for a wider range of
realistic models. This work paves the way for the Koopman-based theory for
Rademacher complexity bounds to be valid for more practical situations.

Motivation: 发现oracle解通常与先前任务最优解保持低损失线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路

Method: 提出增量向量变换(IVT)，周期性地将模型参数变换到保持与先前任务最优解线性连接的解，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换

Result: 在CIFAR-100上提升PASS基线最后准确率+5.12%，减少遗忘2.54%；在FGVCAircraft上提升CLIP预训练SLCA基线平均准确率+14.93%，最后准确率+21.95%

Conclusion: IVT作为即插即用框架能有效缓解灾难性遗忘，适用于无示例和有示例场景，与多种初始化策略兼容

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散数据引导方法主要基于一阶泰勒近似，但在离散状态空间中近似误差可能很大，需要更精确的引导框架。

Method: 推导出给定学习到的离散流匹配模型下期望分布的精确转移率，实现每个采样步骤仅需单次前向传播的高效引导。

Conclusion: 该统一框架足够通用，包含了现有引导方法作为特例，并可无缝应用于掩码扩散模型，显著提升了离散数据引导的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

*Fumin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs)，结合乘法模型和加法模型，在保持可解释性的同时提升预测性能，优于现有的CESR和GAMs方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗保健中，机器学习模型需要可解释性。GAMs通过可视化形状函数提供可解释性，但为保持可解释性而忽略了高阶交互效应，限制了预测性能。CESR模型虽然包含所有特征的交互效应，但性能不如GAMs。

Method: 提出MACMs模型，在CESR乘法模型基础上增加加法部分，分离交互项和独立项的纠缠系数，从而有效扩展假设空间。模型由乘法部分和加法部分组成，两者的形状函数都可以自然可视化。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于神经网络的MACMs在预测性能上显著优于CESR和当前最先进的GAMs方法。

Conclusion: MACMs模型在保持可解释性的同时，通过结合乘法和加法结构，成功提升了预测性能，是对CESR和GAMs的改进。

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning
to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety.
Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing
shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit
higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes
significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve
Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the
visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both
interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless,
CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce
Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an
additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive
and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The
model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape
functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in
interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process.
Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The
experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly
outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of
predictive performance.

Result: 理论分析表明，在存在估计误差时，随机生成过程有效产生训练样本的凸组合，并受到均匀和高斯混合噪声的污染。

Conclusion: 实验验证了理论分析，表明随机生成过程在有限训练样本下会产生训练样本的噪声混合版本。

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical behavior of generative models under
finite training populations. Within the stochastic interpolation generative
framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal velocity field and
score function when only a finite number of training samples are available. We
demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the deterministic
generative process exactly recovers the training samples, while the stochastic
generative process manifests as training samples with added Gaussian noise.
Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce
formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative
models. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in the presence of estimation
errors, the stochastic generation process effectively produces convex
combinations of training samples corrupted by a mixture of uniform and Gaussian
noise. Experiments on generation tasks and downstream tasks such as
classification support our theory.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的攻击方法在发现高奖励提示后容易陷入局部最优，难以覆盖多种有害行为模式，需要显式的多样性目标

Method: 结合主动学习思想，通过定期对受害模型进行安全微调来降低已探索区域的奖励，迫使攻击者寻找新的漏洞区域，形成从易到难的探索课程

Result: 在仅增加6%计算成本的情况下，将跨攻击成功率从0.07%提升至31.28%，相对增益超过400倍，显著优于GFlowNets、PPO和REINFORCE等方法

Conclusion: Active Attacks是一种简单即插即用的模块，能够有效发现广泛的本地攻击模式，实现对多模式分布的广泛覆盖

Abstract: We address the challenge of generating diverse attack prompts for large
language models (LLMs) that elicit harmful behaviors (e.g., insults, sexual
content) and are used for safety fine-tuning. Rather than relying on manual
prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning
(RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as
a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant
challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing
diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward
prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the
active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce
\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its
attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim
LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which
forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally
induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses
beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active
Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their
combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active
Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing
RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including
GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates
against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a
relative gain greater than $400\ \times$) with only a 6% increase in
computation. Our code is publicly available

Abstract: The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale
characteristics of energy data. To address this, we propose a framework that
fine-tunes visual language large models (VLLMs) on 3D graphical representations
of the data. The approach converts 1D time-series into 3D representations using
continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves
validation losses of 0.0952 with CWTs and 0.1064 with RPs on the University of
Sharjah energy dataset, outperforming direct fine-tuning on raw time-series
data (0.1176) for anomaly detection. This work bridges time-series analysis and
visualization, providing a scalable and interpretable framework for energy
analytics.

Method: 基于统计物理思想，在单位置回归任务上分析注意力预测器的高维极限，使用少量序参量捕捉泛化性能。

Result: 在总体水平上，softmax达到贝叶斯风险，而线性注意力存在根本性不足；在有限样本情况下，softmax虽非贝叶斯最优但仍优于线性注意力。

Conclusion: softmax在注意力机制中的优势得到了理论验证，其性能优于线性注意力，并讨论了基于梯度算法的优化连接。

Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation.
Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear)
remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the
easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap
through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the
output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random
location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of
attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization
performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population
level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention
fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to
identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we
analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of
the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it
consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with
optimization by gradient-based algorithms.

Abstract: Activation steering is a promising technique for controlling LLM behavior by
adding semantically meaningful vectors directly into a model's hidden states
during inference. It is often framed as a precise, interpretable, and
potentially safer alternative to fine-tuning. We demonstrate the opposite:
steering systematically breaks model alignment safeguards, making it comply

families, we show that even steering in a random direction can increase the
probability of harmful compliance from 0% to 2-27%. Alarmingly, steering benign
features from a sparse autoencoder (SAE), a common source of interpretable
directions, increases these rates by a further 2-4%. Finally, we show that
combining 20 randomly sampled vectors that jailbreak a single prompt creates a
universal attack, significantly increasing harmful compliance on unseen
requests. These results challenge the paradigm of safety through
interpretability, showing that precise control over model internals does not
guarantee precise control over model behavior.

*Xianghua Zeng,Hao Peng,Angsheng Li,Yicheng Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIHD是一个基于结构信息的分层扩散框架，用于解决离线强化学习中长时程环境和稀疏奖励的问题。它通过自适应构建扩散层次结构，在多个时间尺度上灵活建模轨迹，并使用结构信息增益作为条件信号，同时引入结构熵正则化来鼓励探索并避免分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分层扩散方法通常假设固定的两层扩散层次结构和单一预定义时间尺度，这限制了适应不同下游任务的灵活性。需要一种能够自适应构建扩散层次、在多个时间尺度上建模轨迹的方法，以提升离线策略学习的效果和稳定性。

Method: 分析离线轨迹中的结构信息来自适应构建扩散层次；量化每个状态社区的结构信息增益，并将其作为相应扩散层的条件信号；引入结构熵正则化来鼓励探索代表性不足的状态，同时避免分布偏移的外推误差。

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL任务上的广泛评估表明，SIHD在决策性能上显著优于最先进的基线方法，并在多样化场景中展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SIHD框架通过结构信息驱动的自适应分层扩散，有效解决了长时程离线强化学习中的挑战，提供了更灵活和稳定的策略学习方法。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative methods have shown promising potential for
modeling trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, and
hierarchical diffusion has been introduced to mitigate variance accumulation
and computational challenges in long-horizon planning tasks. However, existing
approaches typically assume a fixed two-layer diffusion hierarchy with a single
predefined temporal scale, which limits adaptability to diverse downstream
tasks and reduces flexibility in decision making. In this work, we propose
SIHD, a novel Structural Information-based Hierarchical Diffusion framework for
effective and stable offline policy learning in long-horizon environments with
sparse rewards. Specifically, we analyze structural information embedded in
offline trajectories to construct the diffusion hierarchy adaptively, enabling
flexible trajectory modeling across multiple temporal scales. Rather than
relying on reward predictions from localized sub-trajectories, we quantify the
structural information gain of each state community and use it as a
conditioning signal within the corresponding diffusion layer. To reduce
overreliance on offline datasets, we introduce a structural entropy regularizer
that encourages exploration of underrepresented states while avoiding
extrapolation errors from distributional shifts. Extensive evaluations on
challenging offline RL tasks show that SIHD significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in decision-making performance and demonstrates
superior generalization across diverse scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有算法追索研究主要关注模型更新的鲁棒性，而忽视了在竞争性资源受限环境中推荐建议如何影响未来申请者群体的时间动态变化

Method: 引入时间感知的算法追索框架，显式建模候选群体对推荐建议的适应性反应；提出基于强化学习的追索算法，捕捉环境演化动态，生成可行且有效的推荐建议

Result: 在复杂仿真环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在可行性和长期有效性之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将时间和行为动态纳入实际追索系统设计的重要性

Abstract: Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable
recommendations that increase their chances of receiving favorable outcomes
from automated decision systems (e.g., loan approvals). While prior research
has emphasized robustness to model updates, considerably less attention has
been given to the temporal dynamics of recourse--particularly in competitive,
resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility
and long-term validity. Together, these results underscore the importance of
incorporating temporal and behavioral dynamics into the design of practical
recourse systems.

TL;DR: 提出了D$^3$S框架，通过动态双级下采样优先处理信息量最大的样本和token，提高策略优化的效率，在多个推理基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无评论者方法（如GRPO）收敛慢的问题，这些方法由于大量无信息样本和token稀释了关键学习信号，导致学习效率低下。

Method: D$^3$S框架包含两个层级：样本级选择优势方差最大的rollouts子集，token级优先处理优势幅度与策略熵乘积高的token，并采用动态下采样调度防止过拟合。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama3.1上的广泛实验表明，将D$^3$S集成到先进RL算法中，在多样化推理基准测试中实现了最先进的性能和泛化能力，同时需要更少的样本和token。

Conclusion: D$^3$S通过优先处理信息量最大的数据，有效提高了策略优化的效率，在保持高性能的同时显著减少了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Critic-free methods like GRPO reduce memory demands by estimating advantages
from multiple rollouts but tend to converge slowly, as critical learning
signals are diluted by an abundance of uninformative samples and tokens. To
tackle this challenge, we propose the \textbf{Dynamic Dual-Level Down-Sampling
(D$^3$S)} framework that prioritizes the most informative samples and tokens
across groups to improve the efficient of policy optimization. D$^3$S operates
along two levels: (1) the sample-level, which selects a subset of rollouts to
maximize advantage variance ($\text{Var}(A)$). We theoretically proven that
this selection is positively correlated with the upper bound of the policy
gradient norms, yielding higher policy gradients. (2) the token-level, which
prioritizes tokens with a high product of advantage magnitude and policy
entropy ($|A_{i,t}|\times H_{i,t}$), focusing updates on tokens where the
policy is both uncertain and impactful. Moreover, to prevent overfitting to
high-signal data, D$^3$S employs a dynamic down-sampling schedule inspired by
curriculum learning. This schedule starts with aggressive down-sampling to
accelerate early learning and gradually relaxes to promote robust
generalization. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5 and Llama3.1 demonstrate that
integrating D$^3$S into advanced RL algorithms achieves state-of-the-art
performance and generalization while requiring \textit{fewer} samples and
tokens across diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our code is added in the
supplementary materials and will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏细粒度机制来调节推理深度，导致简单问题过度推理而复杂问题推理不足的“一刀切”问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法既有效又高效，同时提升任务性能并显著减少平均推理长度。

Conclusion: 难度自适应推理方法为大型音频语言模型提供了智能推理机制，为未来工作提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), powered by the chain-of-thought (CoT)
paradigm, have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities. Intuitively, different
problems often require varying depths of reasoning. While some methods can
determine whether to reason for a given problem, they typically lack a
fine-grained mechanism to modulate how much to reason. This often results in a
``one-size-fits-all'' reasoning depth, which generates redundant overthinking
for simple questions while failing to allocate sufficient thought to complex
ones. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LALMs and find that an
effective and efficient LALM should reason smartly by adapting its reasoning
depth to the problem's complexity. To achieve this, we propose a
difficulty-adaptive reasoning method for LALMs. Specifically, we propose a
reward function that dynamically links reasoning length to the model's
perceived problem difficulty. This reward encourages shorter, concise reasoning
for easy tasks and more elaborate, in-depth reasoning for complex ones.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is both effective and
efficient, simultaneously improving task performance and significantly reducing
the average reasoning length. Further analysis on reasoning structure paradigm
offers valuable insights for future work.

Motivation: 向量量化在现代机器学习中广泛应用，但非可微的量化步骤阻碍了梯度反向传播。现有平滑方法通常分别处理紧密近似和码本利用两个需求。

Method: 提出简单直观的正则化方法，通过最小化每个单纯形顶点与其K个最近邻平滑量化器之间的距离，同时促进紧密近似和码本利用。

Result: 在离散图像自编码和对比语音表示学习等基准测试中，该方法实现了更可靠的码本利用，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的正则化方法能同时满足向量量化平滑的两个关键需求，在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization, which discretizes a continuous vector space into a
finite set of representative vectors (a codebook), has been widely adopted in
modern machine learning. Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a
fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient
backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing
the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of
codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the
codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers
should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2)
all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing
methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present
study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both
simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its
$K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks,
including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation
learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook
utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.

Motivation: 现有DTI预测方法主要依赖SMILES-蛋白质对，未能充分利用小分子和蛋白质的丰富多模态信息。

Method: 使用四模态体积对比学习捕获高阶语义对齐，提出自适应模态dropout动态调节各模态贡献，并利用IC50活性测量作为弱监督。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，GRAMDTI始终优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: 高阶多模态对齐、自适应模态利用和辅助监督有助于实现稳健且可泛化的DTI预测。

Abstract: Drug target interaction (DTI) prediction is a cornerstone of computational
drug discovery, enabling rational design, repurposing, and mechanistic
insights. While deep learning has advanced DTI modeling, existing approaches
primarily rely on SMILES protein pairs and fail to exploit the rich multimodal
information available for small molecules and proteins. We introduce GRAMDTI, a
pretraining framework that integrates multimodal molecular and protein inputs
into unified representations. GRAMDTI extends volume based contrastive learning
to four modalities, capturing higher-order semantic alignment beyond
conventional pairwise approaches. To handle modality informativeness, we
propose adaptive modality dropout, dynamically regulating each modality's
contribution during pre-training. Additionally, IC50 activity measurements,
when available, are incorporated as weak supervision to ground representations
in biologically meaningful interaction strengths. Experiments on four publicly
available datasets demonstrate that GRAMDTI consistently outperforms state of
the art baselines. Our results highlight the benefits of higher order
multimodal alignment, adaptive modality utilization, and auxiliary supervision
for robust and generalizable DTI prediction.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了LLM中后训练N:M激活剪枝方法，发现激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力，并推荐8:16稀疏模式作为硬件友好的最佳选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型推理需求增长，稀疏化技术备受关注。虽然半结构化(N:M)剪枝在权重剪枝中已成熟，但在激活剪枝中的应用仍待探索，尽管它具有动态输入自适应压缩和减少I/O开销的潜力。

Method: 采用后训练N:M激活剪枝方法，评估轻量级即插即用的误差缓解技术和剪枝标准，建立硬件友好的基线方法，仅需最小校准。探索了超越NVIDIA标准2:4的稀疏模式，包括16:32和8:16模式。

Result: 在多个LLM上的实验表明，激活剪枝在相同稀疏度下比权重剪枝能更好地保持生成能力。16:32模式性能接近非结构化稀疏，但考虑到灵活性与硬件实现复杂度的权衡，8:16模式被确定为更优选择。

Conclusion: 研究为激活剪枝提供了有效的实用方法，并为未来硬件支持更灵活稀疏模式提供了动机。8:16稀疏模式在性能和硬件友好性之间达到了最佳平衡。

Abstract: The demand for efficient large language model (LLM) inference has intensified
the focus on sparsification techniques. While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is
well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains
underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and
reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of
methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs,
we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of
generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity
levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and
pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require
minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's
standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par
with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between
flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16
pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical
methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support
more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available

TL;DR: 该论文分析了分类器自由引导(CFG)在扩散模型中的采样动态，揭示了CFG在采样过程中分为三个阶段：方向偏移、模式分离和集中阶段，解释了为什么强引导会提高语义对齐但降低多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CFG被广泛用于提高扩散模型的条件保真度，但其对采样动态的影响仍不清楚。先前研究通常局限于单峰条件分布或简化情况，只能提供部分理解。

Method: 分析CFG在多峰条件分布下的行为，将采样过程划分为三个连续阶段，并通过实验验证理论预测。

Result: 实验支持理论预测：早期强引导侵蚀全局多样性，晚期强引导抑制细粒度变化。理论还自然地提出了时变引导调度方法。

Conclusion: 提出的时变引导调度方法在实验中一致地提高了质量和多样性，为理解CFG机制提供了统一视角。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is widely used to improve conditional fidelity
in diffusion models, but its impact on sampling dynamics remains poorly
understood. Prior studies, often restricted to unimodal conditional
distributions or simplified cases, provide only a partial picture. We analyze
CFG under multimodal conditionals and show that the sampling process unfolds in
three successive stages. In the Direction Shift stage, guidance accelerates
movement toward the weighted mean, introducing initialization bias and norm
growth. In the Mode Separation stage, local dynamics remain largely neutral,
but the inherited bias suppresses weaker modes, reducing global diversity. In
the Concentration stage, guidance amplifies within-mode contraction,
diminishing fine-grained variability. This unified view explains a widely
observed phenomenon: stronger guidance improves semantic alignment but
inevitably reduces diversity. Experiments support these predictions, showing
that early strong guidance erodes global diversity, while late strong guidance
suppresses fine-grained variation. Moreover, our theory naturally suggests a
time-varying guidance schedule, and empirical results confirm that it
consistently improves both quality and diversity.

TL;DR: DYNAWEIGHT是一个用于多智能体网络的动态权重分配框架，通过基于相邻服务器在本地数据集上的相对损失来动态分配权重，从而加速去中心化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化基础设施中，由于缺乏集中聚合，本地处理变得至关重要。传统静态权重分配（如Metropolis权重）无法有效处理数据异构性，需要动态方法来提升学习效率。

Method: DYNAWEIGHT框架动态分配权重给相邻服务器，基于它们在本地数据集上的相对损失。这种方法优先考虑拥有多样化信息的服务器，特别适用于数据异构性显著的情况。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100数据集上的实验表明，DYNAWEIGHT在不同服务器数量和图拓扑结构下都能显著提升训练速度，且仅需最小的额外通信和内存开销。

Conclusion: DYNAWEIGHT作为一种聚合方案，与任何底层服务器级优化算法兼容，具有广泛的适用性和集成潜力，为去中心化学习提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: In today's data-sensitive landscape, distributed learning emerges as a vital
tool, not only fortifying privacy measures but also streamlining computational
operations. This becomes especially crucial within fully decentralized
infrastructures where local processing is imperative due to the absence of
centralized aggregation. Here, we introduce DYNAWEIGHT, a novel framework to
information aggregation in multi-agent networks. DYNAWEIGHT offers substantial
acceleration in decentralized learning with minimal additional communication
and memory overhead. Unlike traditional static weight assignments, such as
Metropolis weights, DYNAWEIGHT dynamically allocates weights to neighboring
servers based on their relative losses on local datasets. Consequently, it
favors servers possessing diverse information, particularly in scenarios of
substantial data heterogeneity. Our experiments on various datasets MNIST,
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 incorporating various server counts and graph topologies,
demonstrate notable enhancements in training speeds. Notably, DYNAWEIGHT
functions as an aggregation scheme compatible with any underlying server-level
optimization algorithm, underscoring its versatility and potential for
widespread integration.

Conclusion: SGRL方法通过结合LLM的结构化目标规划和动作剪枝机制，有效提升了强化学习在复杂环境中的探索效率和决策质量。

Abstract: Real-world decision-making tasks typically occur in complex and open
environments, posing significant challenges to reinforcement learning (RL)
agents' exploration efficiency and long-horizon planning capabilities. A
promising approach is LLM-enhanced RL, which leverages the rich prior knowledge
and strong planning capabilities of LLMs to guide RL agents in efficient
exploration. However, existing methods mostly rely on frequent and costly LLM
invocations and suffer from limited performance due to the semantic mismatch.
In this paper, we introduce a Structured Goal-guided Reinforcement Learning
(SGRL) method that integrates a structured goal planner and a goal-conditioned
action pruner to guide RL agents toward efficient exploration. Specifically,
the structured goal planner utilizes LLMs to generate a reusable, structured
function for goal generation, in which goals are prioritized. Furthermore, by
utilizing LLMs to determine goals' priority weights, it dynamically generates
forward-looking goals to guide the agent's policy toward more promising
decision-making trajectories. The goal-conditioned action pruner employs an
action masking mechanism that filters out actions misaligned with the current
goal, thereby constraining the RL agent to select goal-consistent policies. We
evaluate the proposed method on Crafter and Craftax-Classic, and experimental
results demonstrate that SGRL achieves superior performance compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效从数据中发现对称群并构建高效的等变模型，在保持群对称性的同时简化了网络架构。

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a method for learning group (known or unknown)
equivariant functions by learning the associated quadratic form $x^T A x$
corresponding to the group from the data. Certain groups, known as orthogonal
groups, preserve a specific quadratic form, and we leverage this property to
uncover the underlying symmetry group under the assumption that it is
orthogonal. By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its
inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the
neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and
efficient. Our approach results in an invariant model that preserves norms,
while the equivariant model is represented as a product of a norm-invariant
model and a scale-invariant model, where the ``product'' refers to the group
action.
  Moreover, we extend our framework to a more general setting where the
function acts on tuples of input vectors via a diagonal (or product) group
action. In this extension, the equivariant function is decomposed into an
angular component extracted solely from the normalized first vector and a
scale-invariant component that depends on the full Gram matrix of the tuple.
This decomposition captures the inter-dependencies between multiple inputs
while preserving the underlying group symmetry.
  We assess the effectiveness of our framework across multiple tasks, including
polynomial regression, top quark tagging, and moment of inertia matrix
prediction. Comparative analysis with baseline methods demonstrates that our
model consistently excels in both discovering the underlying symmetry and
efficiently learning the corresponding equivariant function.

Abstract: Standard Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) excel at discovering a dictionary of a
model's learned features, offering a powerful observational lens. However, the
ambiguous and ungrounded nature of these features makes them unreliable
instruments for the active, causal probing of model behavior. To solve this, we
introduce Concept-SAE, a framework that forges semantically grounded concept
tokens through a novel hybrid disentanglement strategy. We first quantitatively
demonstrate that our dual-supervision approach produces tokens that are
remarkably faithful and spatially localized, outperforming alternative methods
in disentanglement. This validated fidelity enables two critical applications:
(1) we probe the causal link between internal concepts and predictions via
direct intervention, and (2) we probe the model's failure modes by
systematically localizing adversarial vulnerabilities to specific layers.
Concept-SAE provides a validated blueprint for moving beyond correlational
interpretation to the mechanistic, causal probing of model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流体动力学中，模拟物理上合理的轨迹向用户定义的目标是一个基本但具有挑战性的任务。基于粒子的模拟器可以高效地再现前向动力学，但逆推理仍然困难，特别是在耗散系统中，动力学是不可逆的，基于优化的求解器速度慢、不稳定且常常无法收敛。

Result: 在三个耗散基准测试（Water-3D、WaterRamps和WaterDrop）上的实验表明，R-GNS实现了更高的准确性和一致性，参数数量仅为四分之一，逆推理速度比基于优化的基线快100倍以上。在目标条件任务中，它消除了迭代优化并实现了数量级的速度提升。

Conclusion: 这是第一个统一耗散流体系统前向和逆模拟的可逆框架，能够通过生动、物理一致的轨迹实现复杂目标形状（如字符"L"和"N"）。

Abstract: Simulating physically plausible trajectories toward user-defined goals is a
fundamental yet challenging task in fluid dynamics. While particle-based
simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference
remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are
irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail
to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator
(R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a
single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate
inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse
the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design
based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling
forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and
efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three
dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS
achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the
parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than
optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed
of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates
iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On
goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex
target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically
consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible
framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid
systems.

TL;DR: AEGIS框架通过重采样现有训练边来增强稀疏二分知识图谱，避免伪造端点，在多个数据集上验证了语义KNN增强的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏二分知识图谱中数据不足和边稀疏导致的链接预测困难问题。

Method: 提出AEGIS边缘增强框架，采用均匀重采样或逆度偏置重采样现有训练边，保持原始节点集不变，避免伪造端点。

Result: 在Amazon和MovieLens数据集上，基于复制的AEGIS变体与基线相当，而语义KNN增强是唯一能恢复AUC和校准的方法；在GDP图上，语义KNN实现了最大的AUC改进和Brier分数降低。

Conclusion: 真实性约束的重采样是稀疏二分链接预测的数据高效策略，当有信息丰富的节点描述时，语义增强能提供额外提升。

Abstract: Bipartite knowledge graphs in niche domains are typically data-poor and
edge-sparse, which hinders link prediction. We introduce AEGIS (Authentic Edge
Growth In Sparsity), an edge-only augmentation framework that resamples
existing training edges -either uniformly simple or with inverse-degree bias
degree-aware -thereby preserving the original node set and sidestepping
fabricated endpoints. To probe authenticity across regimes, we consider
naturally sparse graphs (game design pattern's game-pattern network) and induce
sparsity in denser benchmarks (Amazon, MovieLens) via high-rate bond
percolation. We evaluate augmentations on two complementary metrics: AUC-ROC
(higher is better) and the Brier score (lower is better), using two-tailed
paired t-tests against sparse baselines. On Amazon and MovieLens, copy-based
AEGIS variants match the baseline while the semantic KNN augmentation is the
only method that restores AUC and calibration; random and synthetic edges
remain detrimental. On the text-rich GDP graph, semantic KNN achieves the
largest AUC improvement and Brier score reduction, and simple also lowers the
Brier score relative to the sparse control. These findings position
authenticity-constrained resampling as a data-efficient strategy for sparse
bipartite link prediction, with semantic augmentation providing an additional
boost when informative node descriptions are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动发现SO(3)和SO(n)单参数子群的新框架，通过斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，并学习参数来发现底层单参数子群。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SO(n)的单参数子群在机器人学、量子力学和分子结构分析等应用中至关重要，需要自动发现这些子群的方法。

Method: 利用斜对称矩阵的标准Jordan形式建立轨道规范形式，推导Hγ-不变函数的标准化表示，通过学习参数来发现单参数子群。

Result: 在双摆建模、转动惯量预测、顶夸克标记和不变多项式回归等任务中成功恢复了有意义的子群结构，并产生了可解释的对称感知表示。

Conclusion: 该框架有效发现了SO(n)的单参数子群，并在多个应用中展示了其有效性，提供了可解释的对称感知表示。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for the automatic discovery of one-parameter
subgroups ($H_{\gamma}$) of $SO(3)$ and, more generally, $SO(n)$. One-parameter
subgroups of $SO(n)$ are crucial in a wide range of applications, including
robotics, quantum mechanics, and molecular structure analysis. Our method
utilizes the standard Jordan form of skew-symmetric matrices, which define the
Lie algebra of $SO(n)$, to establish a canonical form for orbits under the
action of $H_{\gamma}$. This canonical form is then employed to derive a
standardized representation for $H_{\gamma}$-invariant functions. By learning
the appropriate parameters, the framework uncovers the underlying one-parameter
subgroup $H_{\gamma}$. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated through tasks such as double pendulum modeling, moment of inertia
prediction, top quark tagging and invariant polynomial regression, where it
successfully recovers meaningful subgroup structure and produces interpretable,
symmetry-aware representations.

TL;DR: WeatherPEFT是一个针对天气基础模型的参数高效微调框架，通过动态提示和自适应参数选择，在保持性能的同时大幅减少可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要针对视觉或语言任务，无法有效处理天气下游任务的独特挑战，如变量异质性、分辨率多样性和时空覆盖变化，导致在天气基础模型上表现不佳。

Method: WeatherPEFT包含两个创新：前向传播中的任务自适应动态提示(TADP)通过内外模式提取动态注入嵌入权重；反向传播中的随机Fisher引导自适应选择(SFAS)利用Fisher信息识别关键参数并引入随机性稳定选择。

Result: 在三个下游任务上，WeatherPEFT使用更少的可训练参数实现了与完全微调相当的性能，而现有PEFT方法则存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WeatherPEFT为天气基础模型提供了一个高效且有效的微调框架，解决了现有PEFT方法在天气任务上的局限性，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: While recent advances in machine learning have equipped Weather Foundation
Models (WFMs) with substantial generalization capabilities across diverse
downstream tasks, the escalating computational requirements associated with
their expanding scale increasingly hinder practical deployment. Current
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, designed for vision or language
tasks, fail to address the unique challenges of weather downstream tasks, such
as variable heterogeneity, resolution diversity, and spatiotemporal coverage
variations, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to WFMs. To bridge
this gap, we introduce WeatherPEFT, a novel PEFT framework for WFMs
incorporating two synergistic innovations. First, during the forward pass,
Task-Adaptive Dynamic Prompting (TADP) dynamically injects the embedding
weights within the encoder to the input tokens of the pre-trained backbone via
internal and external pattern extraction, enabling context-aware feature
recalibration for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, during
backpropagation, Stochastic Fisher-Guided Adaptive Selection (SFAS) not only
leverages Fisher information to identify and update the most task-critical
parameters, thereby preserving invariant pre-trained knowledge, but also
introduces randomness to stabilize the selection. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WeatherPEFT on three downstream tasks, where
existing PEFT methods show significant gaps versus Full-Tuning, and WeatherPEFT
achieves performance parity with Full-Tuning using fewer trainable parameters.
The code of this work will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一个公平感知的强化学习框架fMDP，用于在顺序决策问题中探索性能与公平性的权衡，并在招聘和欺诈检测场景中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的顺序决策问题需要平衡性能和公平性，但理想的权衡难以预先确定，因此需要能够探索多种权衡方案的算法。

Method: 提出了扩展的马尔可夫决策过程fMDP，明确编码个体和群体信息，并在此框架下形式化公平概念，计算随时间变化的公平度量。

Result: 在招聘和欺诈检测场景中，该框架学习的策略在多个场景下更加公平，性能损失很小，且发现群体公平和个体公平并不必然相互蕴含。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不同问题设置中应用，为利益相关者选择合适的公平-性能权衡策略提供指导。

Abstract: Equity in real-world sequential decision problems can be enforced using
fairness-aware methods. Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable
and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness
notions. As the desired performance-fairness trade-off is hard to specify a
priori, we propose a framework where multiple trade-offs can be explored.
Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the
obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in
selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an
extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals
and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of
sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes
fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with
distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed
while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent
transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly
distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair
across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward.
Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not
necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in
settings where both fairness types are desired. Finally, we provide guidelines
on how to apply this framework across different problem settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在组合问题（如数独、旅行商问题）上表现不佳，需要填补这一能力空白。

Method: 使用GPT-2架构，结合数独规则的模仿学习和显式深度优先搜索策略，包括有根据的猜测和回溯。

Result: 在数独问题上达到99%的准确率，超越了之前的神经符号方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了NP类问题，并建立了与上下文变体Min-Sum Set Cover问题的理论联系。

Abstract: Despite their proficiency in various language tasks, Large Language Models
(LLMs) struggle with combinatorial problems like Satisfiability, Traveling
Salesman Problem, or even basic arithmetic. We address this gap through a novel
approach for solving problems in the class NP. We focus on the paradigmatic
task of Sudoku and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (99\%) compared to prior
neuro-symbolic approaches. Unlike prior work that used custom architectures,
our method employs a vanilla decoder-only Transformer (GPT-2) without external
tools or function calling. Our method integrates imitation learning of simple
Sudoku rules with an explicit Depth-First Search (DFS) exploration strategy
involving informed guessing and backtracking. Moving beyond imitation learning,
we seek to minimize the number of guesses until reaching a solution. We provide
a rigorous analysis of this setup formalizing its connection to a contextual
variant of Min-Sum Set Cover, a well-studied problem in algorithms and
stochastic optimization.

TL;DR: ASSESS框架通过结合语义和结构信息，为形式化语句相似性提供连续评分，使用TransTED相似性度量在EPLA基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形式化语句相似性度量方法无法平衡语义和结构信息，字符串方法忽略语义，证明方法缺乏分级相似性评分。

Method: 将形式化语句转换为操作符树捕获句法结构，使用TransTED相似性度量（增强的树编辑距离）结合语义感知。

Result: 在EPLA基准测试（524个专家标注的形式化语句对）上，TransTED相似性达到最先进精度和最高Kappa系数。

Conclusion: ASSESS框架有效整合语义和结构信息，为自动形式化评估提供了更准确的相似性度量方法。

Abstract: Statement autoformalization, the automated translation of statements from
natural language into formal languages, has seen significant advancements, yet
the development of automated evaluation metrics remains limited. Existing
metrics for formal statement similarity often fail to balance semantic and
structural information. String-based approaches capture syntactic structure but
ignore semantic meaning, whereas proof-based methods validate semantic
equivalence but disregard structural nuances and, critically, provide no graded
similarity score in the event of proof failure. To address these issues, we
introduce ASSESS (A Semantic and Structural Evaluation Framework for Statement
Similarity), which comprehensively integrates semantic and structural
information to provide a continuous similarity score. Our framework first
transforms formal statements into Operator Trees to capture their syntactic
structure and then computes a similarity score using our novel TransTED
(Transformation Tree Edit Distance) Similarity metric, which enhances
traditional Tree Edit Distance by incorporating semantic awareness through
transformations. For rigorous validation, we present EPLA (Evaluating
Provability and Likeness for Autoformalization), a new benchmark of 524
expert-annotated formal statement pairs derived from miniF2F and ProofNet, with
labels for both semantic provability and structural likeness. Experiments on
EPLA demonstrate that TransTED Similarity outperforms existing methods,
achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and the highest Kappa coefficient. The
benchmark, and implementation code will be made public soon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCGM是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过高效聚类操作赋予几何图神经网络分层全局上下文，解决了传统几何GNN在建模长程相互作用时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何图神经网络擅长捕捉分子几何结构，但其局部偏置的消息传递机制难以建模长程相互作用。现有解决方案存在根本性限制：扩展截断半径会导致计算成本随距离立方增长；物理启发核函数通常系统特定且缺乏通用性；傅里叶空间方法需要仔细调整多个参数且增加计算开销。

Method: MCGM通过多阶段聚类全局建模，构建原子簇的多分辨率层次结构，通过动态分层聚类提取全局信息，并通过学习变换将此上下文传播回去，最终通过残差连接增强原子特征。

Result: 在四种不同骨干架构中无缝集成MCGM，将OE62能量预测误差平均降低26.2%。在AQM上，MCGM实现了最先进的精度（能量17.0 meV，力4.9 meV/Å），同时比Neural P3M少使用20%的参数。

Conclusion: MCGM是一种有效的解决方案，能够以轻量级方式为几何GNN提供分层全局上下文，显著提升长程相互作用建模能力，并在多个基准测试中取得优异性能。

Abstract: Geometric graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing molecular geometry,
yet their locality-biased message passing hampers the modeling of long-range
interactions. Current solutions have fundamental limitations: extending cutoff
radii causes computational costs to scale cubically with distance;
physics-inspired kernels (e.g., Coulomb, dispersion) are often system-specific
and lack generality; Fourier-space methods require careful tuning of multiple
parameters (e.g., mesh size, k-space cutoff) with added computational overhead.
We introduce Multi-stage Clustered Global Modeling (MCGM), a lightweight,
plug-and-play module that endows geometric GNNs with hierarchical global
context through efficient clustering operations. MCGM builds a multi-resolution
hierarchy of atomic clusters, distills global information via dynamic
hierarchical clustering, and propagates this context back through learned
transformations, ultimately reinforcing atomic features via residual
connections. Seamlessly integrated into four diverse backbone architectures,
MCGM reduces OE62 energy prediction error by an average of 26.2%. On AQM, MCGM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (17.0 meV for energy, 4.9 meV/{\AA} for
forces) while using 20% fewer parameters than Neural P3M. Code will be made
available upon acceptance.

Result: 在识别单色子图、点云语义分割等任务中表现有效，特别是在底层图结构重要的场景下。

Conclusion: WIRE是RoPE在图结构数据上的有效扩展，具有理论保证并在实际任务中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce WIRE: Wavelet-Induced Rotary Encodings. WIRE extends Rotary
Position Encodings (RoPE), a popular algorithm in LLMs and ViTs, to
graph-structured data. We demonstrate that WIRE is more general than RoPE,
recovering the latter in the special case of grid graphs. WIRE also enjoys a
host of desirable theoretical properties, including equivariance under node
ordering permutation, compatibility with linear attention, and (under select
assumptions) asymptotic dependence on graph resistive distance. We test WIRE on
a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including identifying monochromatic
subgraphs, semantic segmentation of point clouds, and more standard graph
benchmarks. We find it to be effective in settings where the underlying graph
structure is important.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器存在特征吸收（专用特征捕获通用特征实例）和特征组合（独立特征合并为复合表示）的问题，这限制了特征的可解释性和分解质量。

Method: 引入正交性约束，通过惩罚SAE特征间的高余弦相似度来强制特征正交，新的训练程序线性扩展计算复杂度，避免显著计算开销。

Result: OrtSAE发现了9%更多独特特征，减少特征吸收65%和组合15%，在虚假相关性去除任务上性能提升6%，其他下游任务性能与传统SAE相当。

Conclusion: 正交稀疏自编码器通过特征正交性约束有效缓解了特征吸收和组合问题，提升了特征分解质量和解耦能力，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a technique for sparse decomposition of neural
network activations into human-interpretable features. However, current SAEs
suffer from feature absorption, where specialized features capture instances of
general features creating representation holes, and feature composition, where
independent features merge into composite representations. In this work, we
introduce Orthogonal SAE (OrtSAE), a novel approach aimed to mitigate these
issues by enforcing orthogonality between the learned features. By implementing
a new training procedure that penalizes high pairwise cosine similarity between
SAE features, OrtSAE promotes the development of disentangled features while
scaling linearly with the SAE size, avoiding significant computational
overhead. We train OrtSAE across different models and layers and compare it
with other methods. We find that OrtSAE discovers 9% more distinct features,
reduces feature absorption (by 65%) and composition (by 15%), improves
performance on spurious correlation removal (+6%), and achieves on-par
performance for other downstream tasks compared to traditional SAEs.

TL;DR: HEAPr是一种新颖的MoE模型剪枝算法，通过将专家分解为原子专家进行细粒度剪枝，利用二阶信息评估重要性，显著降低内存需求并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然性能优异且推理成本低，但参数量大导致内存需求过高，限制了实际部署。现有的专家级剪枝方法粒度太粗，会导致显著的精度下降。

Method: 将专家分解为更小的原子专家，利用类似OBS理论的二阶信息评估原子专家重要性。通过将二阶信息从专家参数转换为原子专家参数，再简化为原子专家输出的二阶信息，将空间复杂度从O(d^4)降低到O(d^2)。仅需在小型校准集上进行两次前向传播和一次反向传播。

Result: 在DeepSeek MoE和Qwen MoE等模型上的实验表明，HEAPr在广泛的压缩比和基准测试中优于现有专家级剪枝方法。在20%~25%压缩比下实现近乎无损压缩，同时减少约20%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: HEAPr通过原子专家剪枝和高效二阶信息计算，成功解决了MoE模型内存需求过高的问题，实现了高性能的模型压缩。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures in large language models (LLMs)
deliver exceptional performance and reduced inference costs compared to dense
LLMs. However, their large parameter counts result in prohibitive memory
requirements, limiting practical deployment. While existing pruning methods
primarily focus on expert-level pruning, this coarse granularity often leads to
substantial accuracy degradation. In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel
pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic
experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure
the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information
based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address
the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information,
HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the
second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert
parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic
expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where
d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward
passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the
importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including
DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing
expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and
benchmarks. Specifically, HEAPr achieves nearly lossless compression at
compression ratios of 20% ~ 25% in most models, while also reducing FLOPs
nearly by 20%. The code can be found at

Motivation: 解决强化学习在任务不匹配情况下的适应性问题，现有方法主要局限于同分布设置，无法有效处理分布外任务

Method: APB方法在共享骨干网络前后插入轻量级线性层，实现参数高效微调，同时保留先验知识

Result: APB在样本效率上优于标准RL方法，能够适应分布外任务，而现有元RL基线方法通常失败

Conclusion: APB方法通过参数高效微调机制，在任务不匹配情况下有效提升了强化学习的适应性和样本效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results across domains,
yet learning an optimal policy typically requires extensive interaction data,
limiting practical deployment. A common remedy is to leverage priors, such as
pre-collected datasets or reference policies, but their utility degrades under
task mismatch between training and deployment. While prior work has sought to
address this mismatch, it has largely been restricted to in-distribution
settings. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Policy Backbone (APB),
a meta-transfer RL method that inserts lightweight linear layers before and
after a shared backbone, thereby enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) while preserving prior knowledge during adaptation. Our results show
that APB improves sample efficiency over standard RL and adapts to
out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks where existing meta-RL baselines typically
fail.

Motivation: 目标是开发一种能够保持绕路诱导的局部非凸性的降维方法，为实践者提供可验证的失真保证。

Method: 构建k-NN图，识别欧几里得距离与最短路径比率低于阈值的可接受对，聚合其归一化方向形成正半定非凸性结构矩阵，使用该矩阵的前k个特征向量进行投影。

Result: 提供了两种可验证保证：成对后验证书（限制每个可接受对的投影后失真）和平均情况谱边界（将捕获方向能量与结构矩阵谱联系起来）。

Conclusion: CDP是一种有效的降维方法，能够保持局部非凸性并提供可验证的失真保证，评估协议使实践者能够在自己的数据上检查这些保证。

Abstract: We propose Convexity-Driven Projection (CDP), a boundary-free linear method
for dimensionality reduction of point clouds that targets preserving
detour-induced local non-convexity. CDP builds a $k$-NN graph, identifies
admissible pairs whose Euclidean-to-shortest-path ratios are below a threshold,
and aggregates their normalized directions to form a positive semidefinite
non-convexity structure matrix. The projection uses the top-$k$ eigenvectors of
the structure matrix. We give two verifiable guarantees. A pairwise
a-posteriori certificate that bounds the post-projection distortion for each
admissible pair, and an average-case spectral bound that links expected
captured direction energy to the spectrum of the structure matrix, yielding
quantile statements for typical distortion. Our evaluation protocol reports
fixed- and reselected-pairs detour errors and certificate quantiles, enabling
practitioners to check guarantees on their data.

TL;DR: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)方法，在保持初始推理速度的同时，通过逐步替换学生模型层为教师模型层来提升性能，解决知识蒸馏中性能与效率的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型日益庞大复杂，导致内存消耗和计算需求增加，模型加载时间和初始推理延迟显著上升，在移动设备和延迟敏感环境中频繁加载卸载模型严重影响用户体验。

Method: 提出渐进式权重加载(PWL)技术：先部署轻量级学生模型进行快速初始推理，然后逐步用预训练教师模型的层替换学生模型层。引入训练方法对齐学生和教师层的中间特征表示，同时提升学生模型的整体输出性能。

Result: 在VGG、ResNet和ViT架构上的实验表明，PWL训练的模型保持了有竞争力的蒸馏性能，随着教师层加载逐步提升准确率，最终达到完整教师模型的准确率，且不损害初始推理速度。

Conclusion: PWL特别适合动态、资源受限的部署场景，在响应性和性能都至关重要的环境中表现出色，有效解决了知识蒸馏中性能与效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Deep learning models have become increasingly large and complex, resulting in
higher memory consumption and computational demands. Consequently, model
loading times and initial inference latency have increased, posing significant
challenges in mobile and latency-sensitive environments where frequent model
loading and unloading are required, which directly impacts user experience.
While Knowledge Distillation (KD) offers a solution by compressing large
teacher models into smaller student ones, it often comes at the cost of reduced
performance. To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading
(PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying
a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those
of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we
introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature
representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the
overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG,
ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain
competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher
layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without
compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for
dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and
performance are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多目标设置中，GRPO容易受到奖励攻击的影响，即只优化其中一个目标而牺牲其他目标。由于许多现实任务中缺乏高度可靠的奖励模型，需要一种能够自动平衡多个奖励函数的算法。

Method: 提出MO-GRPO，使用归一化方法根据奖励函数值的方差自动重新加权奖励函数，确保所有奖励函数对损失函数的贡献均等，同时保持偏好顺序不变。

Conclusion: MO-GRPO是多目标强化学习问题中一个有前景的算法，能够稳定学习并避免奖励攻击问题。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has been shown to be an effective
algorithm when an accurate reward model is available. However, such a highly
reliable reward model is not available in many real-world tasks. In this paper,
we particularly focus on multi-objective settings, in which we identify that
GRPO is vulnerable to reward hacking, optimizing only one of the objectives at
the cost of the others. To address this issue, we propose MO-GRPO, an extension
of GRPO with a simple normalization method to reweight the reward functions
automatically according to the variances of their values. We first show
analytically that MO-GRPO ensures that all reward functions contribute evenly
to the loss function while preserving the order of preferences, eliminating the
need for manual tuning of the reward functions' scales. Then, we evaluate

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度持续学习中神经网络可塑性丧失的原因，发现Hessian谱崩溃是导致新任务学习失败的关键因素，并提出了基于Kronecker分解的两种正则化方法来保持网络可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络在持续学习中为什么会丧失可塑性，即无法学习新任务而需要重新初始化参数的问题。

Method: 引入τ-可训练性概念，基于Hessian的Kronecker分解近似，提出了两种正则化增强方法：保持高有效特征秩和应用L2惩罚。

Result: 在持续监督学习和强化学习任务上的实验表明，结合这两种正则化器能有效保持网络可塑性。

Conclusion: Hessian谱崩溃是导致深度持续学习中可塑性丧失的根本原因，通过针对性的正则化方法可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: We investigate why deep neural networks suffer from \emph{loss of plasticity}
in deep continual learning, failing to learn new tasks without reinitializing
parameters. We show that this failure is preceded by Hessian spectral collapse
at new-task initialization, where meaningful curvature directions vanish and
gradient descent becomes ineffective. To characterize the necessary condition
for successful training, we introduce the notion of $\tau$-trainability and
show that current plasticity preserving algorithms can be unified under this
framework. Targeting spectral collapse directly, we then discuss the Kronecker
factored approximation of the Hessian, which motivates two regularization
enhancements: maintaining high effective feature rank and applying $L2$
penalties. Experiments on continual supervised and reinforcement learning tasks
confirm that combining these two regularizers effectively preserves plasticity.

TL;DR: BrainPro是一个大型EEG基础模型，通过检索式空间学习模块和脑状态解耦模块，解决了现有模型在捕捉通道间交互和状态感知表示学习方面的不足，在多个BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型未能显式捕捉通道间和区域间的交互信息，且由于数据集通道配置不同，要么用自注意力近似空间结构，要么限制在有限通道上训练。此外，当前模型很少在自监督预训练中学习状态感知表示。

Method: 提出BrainPro模型，包含检索式空间学习模块（灵活捕捉不同电极布局下的通道和区域级交互）和脑状态解耦模块（通过并行编码器与解耦和区域感知重建损失实现状态感知表示学习）。

Result: 在大规模EEG语料库上预训练后，BrainPro在九个公共BCI数据集上实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: BrainPro通过创新的空间学习和状态解耦设计，能够无缝适应多样化任务和硬件设置，显著提升了EEG解码的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique for recording brain
electrical activity, widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) and
healthcare. Recent EEG foundation models trained on large-scale datasets have
shown improved performance and generalizability over traditional decoding
methods, yet significant challenges remain. Existing models often fail to
explicitly capture channel-to-channel and region-to-region interactions, which
are critical sources of information inherently encoded in EEG signals. Due to
varying channel configurations across datasets, they either approximate spatial
structure with self-attention or restrict training to a limited set of common
channels, sacrificing flexibility and effectiveness. Moreover, although EEG
datasets reflect diverse brain states such as emotion, motor, and others,
current models rarely learn state-aware representations during self-supervised
pre-training. To address these gaps, we propose BrainPro, a large EEG model
that introduces a retrieval-based spatial learning block to flexibly capture
channel- and region-level interactions across varying electrode layouts, and a
brain state-decoupling block that enables state-aware representation learning
through parallel encoders with decoupling and region-aware reconstruction
losses. This design allows BrainPro to adapt seamlessly to diverse tasks and
hardware settings. Pre-trained on an extensive EEG corpus, BrainPro achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization across nine public BCI
datasets. Our codes and the pre-trained weights will be released.

TL;DR: SurvDiff是一个专门为生存分析设计的端到端扩散模型，能够联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失数据，通过生存导向的损失函数确保生成数据的分布保真度和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生存分析数据由于删失（如失访、退出研究）导致事件信息不完整，这对合成数据生成提出了独特挑战，需要同时忠实再现事件时间分布和删失机制。

Method: 提出SurvDiff扩散模型，使用生存导向的损失函数联合生成混合类型协变量、事件时间和右删失数据，该损失函数编码时间到事件结构并直接优化下游生存任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上，SurvDiff在分布保真度和下游评估指标方面始终优于最先进的生成基线方法。

Conclusion: SurvDiff是首个专门为生成合成生存数据设计的扩散模型，能够真实再现事件时间分布并保持删失机制，在临床研究中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a cornerstone of clinical research by modeling
time-to-event outcomes such as metastasis, disease relapse, or patient death.
Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event
information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up. This poses unique challenges
for synthetic data generation, where it is crucial for clinical research to
faithfully reproduce both the event-time distribution and the censoring
mechanism. In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model
specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis.
SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly
generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a
survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure
and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that
SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves
the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \survdiff
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both
distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple
medical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, SurvDiff is the first diffusion
model explicitly designed for generating synthetic survival data.

TL;DR: 提出在教师模型训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签中的类内信息，并通过融入边界损失解决训练不稳定和收敛慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法中，教师模型主要遵循真实标签作为目标，没有考虑同一类内的多样化表示。软标签中的隐含知识来源于数据的多视角结构，同一类内的特征变化能让学生模型通过学得多样化表示来获得更好的泛化能力。

Method: 在教师训练中引入类内对比损失来丰富软标签的类内信息，同时融入边界损失以改善训练稳定性和收敛速度。理论分析了该损失对类内距离和类间距离的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明所提方法的有效性，类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性。

Conclusion: 通过类内对比损失和边界损失的结合，能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的质量，让学生模型获得更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Motivation: 现有静态世界模型在处理新颖或罕见配置时表现不佳，需要研究能够自我适应的动态世界模型。

Method: 形式化上下文环境学习，识别两种核心机制(环境识别和环境学习)，推导误差上界，并通过实验验证机制存在及数据分布、模型架构对ICEL的影响。

Result: 实证确认世界模型中存在不同的上下文学习机制，数据分布和模型架构以符合理论的方式影响ICEL，长上下文和多样化环境是ICEL涌现的关键因素。

Conclusion: 研究展示了自我适应世界模型的潜力，并揭示了ICEL涌现的关键因素，特别是长上下文和多样化环境的必要性。

Abstract: The capability of predicting environmental dynamics underpins both biological
neural systems and general embodied AI in adapting to their surroundings. Yet
prevailing approaches rest on static world models that falter when confronted
with novel or rare configurations. We investigate in-context environment
learning (ICEL), shifting attention from zero-shot performance to the growth
and asymptotic limits of the world model. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)
we formalize in-context learning of a world model and identify two core
mechanisms: environment recognition and environment learning; (2) we derive
error upper-bounds for both mechanisms that expose how the mechanisms emerge;
and (3) we empirically confirm that distinct ICL mechanisms exist in the world
model, and we further investigate how data distribution and model architecture
affect ICL in a manner consistent with theory. These findings demonstrate the
potential of self-adapting world models and highlight the key factors behind
the emergence of ICEL, most notably the necessity of long context and diverse
environments.

Result: 识别了迁移参数作为通用知识载体的作用机制，发现了影响迁移效果的关键因素，并解释了为什么在某些情况下参数迁移会导致比从头训练更差的性能。

Conclusion: 为参数迁移提供了理论分析框架，揭示了参数迁移有效性的关键条件，有助于指导实际应用中的迁移学习策略。

Abstract: Parameter transfer is a central paradigm in transfer learning, enabling
knowledge reuse across tasks and domains by sharing model parameters between
upstream and downstream models. However, when only a subset of parameters from
the upstream model is transferred to the downstream model, there remains a lack
of theoretical understanding of the conditions under which such partial
parameter reuse is beneficial and of the factors that govern its effectiveness.
To address this gap, we analyze a setting in which both the upstream and
downstream models are ReLU convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this
theoretical framework, we characterize how the inherited parameters act as
carriers of universal knowledge and identify key factors that amplify their
beneficial impact on the target task. Furthermore, our analysis provides
insight into why, in certain cases, transferring parameters can lead to lower
test accuracy on the target task than training a new model from scratch.
Numerical experiments and real-world data experiments are conducted to
empirically validate our theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出随机激活函数策略，在LLM前馈层中随机选择SILU或RELU非线性函数，解决RELU的优化问题，并在预训练和生成任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RELU激活函数在负输入区域梯度消失的问题，同时探索在保持性能的前提下减少推理计算量和增加生成多样性的方法。

Method: 使用伯努利分布随机选择SILU或RELU激活函数，在预训练阶段使用随机激活，微调阶段固定为RELU以提供稀疏性，或在生成阶段直接使用随机激活增加多样性。

Result: 预训练+微调策略比直接使用RELU训练效果更好，推理时FLOPs减少且CPU速度显著提升；生成任务中随机激活性能接近最佳确定性非线性函数，提供可控的文本多样性增加。

Conclusion: 随机激活函数策略有效解决了RELU的优化问题，在减少推理计算成本和提高生成多样性方面都表现出良好效果，为LLM优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce stochastic activations. This novel strategy randomly selects
between several non-linear functions in the feed-forward layer of a large
language model. In particular, we choose between SILU or RELU depending on a
Bernoulli draw. This strategy circumvents the optimization problem associated
with RELU, namely, the constant shape for negative inputs that prevents the
gradient flow. We leverage this strategy in two ways:
  (1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model
with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.
This reduces the inference FLOPs and translates into a significant speedup in
the CPU. Interestingly, this leads to much better results than training from
scratch with the RELU activation function.
  (2) We evaluate stochastic activations for generation. This strategy performs
reasonably well: it is only slightly inferior to the best deterministic
non-linearity, namely SILU combined with temperature scaling. This offers an
alternative to existing strategies by providing a controlled way to increase
the diversity of the generated text.

Motivation: 联邦学习通过本地数据保护隐私，但梯度反演攻击构成严重威胁。现有方法假设线性参数轨迹，严重低估了SGD的非线性复杂性，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 提出非线性代理模型扩展(NL-SME)，用可学习的二次贝塞尔曲线替代线性插值，通过控制点捕捉SGD的曲线特征，结合正则化和dvec缩放机制增强表达能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和FEMNIST数据集上的实验表明，NL-SME在所有指标上显著优于基线方法，实现了余弦相似度损失的指数级改进，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了联邦学习多步更新范式中的隐私脆弱性，并为开发鲁棒防御策略提供了新视角。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) preserves privacy by keeping raw data local, yet
Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs) pose significant threats. In FedAVG
multi-step scenarios, attackers observe only aggregated gradients, making data
reconstruction challenging. Existing surrogate model methods like SME assume
linear parameter trajectories, but we demonstrate this severely underestimates
SGD's nonlinear complexity, fundamentally limiting attack effectiveness. We
propose Non-Linear Surrogate Model Extension (NL-SME), the first method to
introduce nonlinear parametric trajectory modeling for GIAs. Our approach
replaces linear interpolation with learnable quadratic B\'ezier curves that
capture SGD's curved characteristics through control points, combined with
regularization and dvec scaling mechanisms for enhanced expressiveness.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and FEMNIST datasets show NL-SME
significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics, achieving
order-of-magnitude improvements in cosine similarity loss while maintaining
computational efficiency.This work exposes heightened privacy vulnerabilities
in FL's multi-step update paradigm and offers novel perspectives for developing
robust defense strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过不频繁的全局同步来减少通信，但其效率仍有提升空间。需要更有效的方法来降低分布式训练的内存和计算开销。

Method: 在本地更新步骤中，每个节点只更新固定的参数子集，其余参数保持冻结。完整的前向传播避免了节点间激活交换的需要。

Result: 在32个节点上训练13亿参数语言模型的实验表明，该方法在相同token和带宽预算下达到了先前低通信方法的困惑度，同时减少了训练计算量和峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: 通过限制反向传播的参数更新范围，可以显著提高分布式训练的效率和可扩展性，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce a memory- and compute-efficient method for low-communication
distributed training. Existing methods reduce communication by performing
multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We
demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting
backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only
a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This
constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a
full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node
activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained
across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior
low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while
reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.

SHAKE-GNN, a novel scalable graph-level GNN framework based on a hierarchy of
Kirchhoff Forests, a class of random spanning forests used to construct
stochastic multi-resolution decompositions of graphs. SHAKE-GNN produces
multi-scale representations, enabling flexible trade-offs between efficiency

the trade-off parameter and analyse the time-complexity of SHAKE-GNN.
Experimental results on multiple large-scale graph classification benchmarks

Abstract: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have been successful in various
applications due to their continuous nature and parameter-sharing efficiency.
However, these unique characteristics also introduce challenges in training,
particularly with respect to gradient computation accuracy and convergence
analysis. In this paper, we address these challenges by investigating the
impact of activation functions. We demonstrate that the properties of
activation functions, specifically smoothness and nonlinearity, are critical to
the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique
solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is
essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel
(NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the
global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized
regimes. Our theoretical findings are validated by numerical experiments, which
not only support our analysis but also provide practical guidelines for scaling
Neural ODEs, potentially leading to faster training and improved performance in
real-world applications.

Result: 实证分析表明，该变分目标能够在算法任务中选择低复杂度解并实现强泛化，但标准优化器无法从随机初始化找到此类解，凸显了关键优化挑战。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化能力的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

Motivation: 心理属性很少孤立运作，教练需要理解相关特征之间的网络关系。现有方法在处理混合类型变量（序数问卷得分、分类人口统计、连续指标）时存在局限。

Method: 结合潜在高斯copula和基于约束的骨架，通过约束的基于评分的细化来返回单个DAG，还研究了bootstrap聚合变体以提高稳定性。

Result: 在模拟中，latent MMHC在结构汉明距离和边召回率方面优于最近的copula学习方法，同时保持高特异性。在排球数据中，学习到的网络围绕目标设定和自信心组织心理技能，情绪唤醒连接动机和焦虑。

Conclusion: 该方法为体育心理特征分析和运动员发展决策支持提供了一个可解释的、数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Psychological attributes rarely operate in isolation: coaches reason about
networks of related traits. We analyze a new dataset of 164 female volleyball
players from Italy's C and D leagues that combines standardized psychological
profiling with background information. To learn directed relationships among
mixed-type variables (ordinal questionnaire scores, categorical demographics,
continuous indicators), we introduce latent MMHC, a hybrid structure learner
that couples a latent Gaussian copula and a constraint-based skeleton with a
constrained score-based refinement to return a single DAG. We also study a
bootstrap-aggregated variant for stability. In simulations spanning sample
size, sparsity, and dimension, latent Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) attains
lower structural Hamming distance and higher edge recall than recent
copula-based learners while maintaining high specificity. Applied to
volleyball, the learned network organizes mental skills around goal setting and
self-confidence, with emotional arousal linking motivation and anxiety, and
locates Big-Five traits (notably neuroticism and extraversion) upstream of
skill clusters. Scenario analyses quantify how improvements in specific skills
propagate through the network to shift preparation, confidence, and
self-esteem. The approach provides an interpretable, data-driven framework for
profiling psychological traits in sport and for decision support in athlete
development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前物理信息图神经网络(PIGNNs)作为AC潮流快速求解器，在精度方面仍需改进，特别是物理损失在推理时无效，这阻碍了其在运行中的采用。

Method: 提出PIGNN-Attn-LS，结合边缘感知注意力机制（通过每边偏置显式编码线路物理特性）和基于回溯线搜索的全局化校正算子（在推理时恢复有效的下降准则）。

Result: 在4-32总线电网测试中，电压测试RMSE为0.00033 p.u.，角度为0.08°，分别比PIGNN-MLP基线提升99.5%和87.1%；在4-1024总线电网上，批量推理速度比牛顿-拉夫逊法快2-5倍。

Conclusion: PIGNN-Attn-LS通过结合物理感知的注意力机制和全局化校正，显著提高了AC潮流求解的精度和效率，为大规模场景评估提供了可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning challenges the assumption that the underlying
distribution remains consistent throughout the training and implementation of a
prediction model. In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where
adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established
prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email
filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods
must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of
malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at
modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such
adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation
which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's
optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats
to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the
adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression
scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation
program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or
uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-FREE是一个无需对比学习的分子表示学习框架，通过整合2D图结构和3D构象集合，在潜在空间中预测子图嵌入，实现了最先进的分子属性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子表示学习方法要么依赖手工数据增强或复杂生成目标，要么仅使用2D拓扑结构而未能充分利用3D结构信息，导致高质量标记数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用固定半径的ego-net作为建模单元，在混合GNN-Transformer骨干网络中通过预测子图在互补邻域中的嵌入来学习表示，无需负样本、位置编码或昂贵预处理。

Result: 在GEOM数据集上预训练后，在MoleculeNet上达到最先进结果，超越了对比学习、生成式和其他多模态自监督方法，并在不同规模和分子类型的数据集上表现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 3D信息增强的分子表示对于有效迁移到新化学领域至关重要，C-FREE框架成功整合了几何和拓扑信息，无需复杂对比学习机制。

Abstract: High-quality molecular representations are essential for property prediction
and molecular design, yet large labeled datasets remain scarce. While
self-supervised pretraining on molecular graphs has shown promise, many
existing approaches either depend on hand-crafted augmentations or complex
generative objectives, and often rely solely on 2D topology, leaving valuable
3D structural information underutilized. To address this gap, we introduce
C-FREE (Contrast-Free Representation learning on Ego-nets), a simple framework
that integrates 2D graphs with ensembles of 3D conformers. C-FREE learns
molecular representations by predicting subgraph embeddings from their
complementary neighborhoods in the latent space, using fixed-radius ego-nets as
modeling units across different conformers. This design allows us to integrate
both geometric and topological information within a hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-Transformer backbone, without negatives, positional encodings, or
expensive pre-processing. Pretraining on the GEOM dataset, which provides rich
3D conformational diversity, C-FREE achieves state-of-the-art results on
MoleculeNet, surpassing contrastive, generative, and other multimodal
self-supervised methods. Fine-tuning across datasets with diverse sizes and
molecule types further demonstrates that pretraining transfers effectively to
new chemical domains, highlighting the importance of 3D-informed molecular
representations.

TL;DR: 提出了OFMU，一种基于惩罚的双层优化框架，用于机器遗忘，通过分层结构优先处理遗忘目标同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在敏感应用中部署的大语言模型需要能够遗忘特定知识（如用户请求、版权材料、过时信息），而无需从头重新训练，以确保合规性、用户隐私和安全性。

Method: 采用惩罚性双层优化框架，内层最大化步骤通过相似性感知惩罚强制遗忘，外层最小化步骤恢复模型效用，并开发了具有收敛保证的两环算法。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中的广泛实验表明，OFMU在遗忘效果和保留效用方面始终优于现有遗忘方法。

Conclusion: OFMU方法在遗忘效果和模型效用之间实现了更好的权衡，为机器遗忘提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models deployed in sensitive applications increasingly require
the ability to unlearn specific knowledge, such as user requests, copyrighted
materials, or outdated information, without retraining from scratch to ensure
regulatory compliance, user privacy, and safety. This task, known as machine
unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while
maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is
to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a
single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention
losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in
unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting
gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a
penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes
forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our
method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a
similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and
retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step.
To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable
convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further
provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our
approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model
utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and
language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing
unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VITAL是一个基于大语言模型的框架，专门用于处理电子健康记录中不规则采样的生理时间序列数据，通过区分生命体征和实验室测试变量，分别采用不同的编码策略来处理缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的时间序列数据存在不规则采样和高缺失率的问题，临床变量根据工作流程和干预时间以不均匀间隔测量，这给建模带来了挑战。

Method: VITAL框架区分生命体征和实验室测试变量：将生命体征重新编程到语言空间，使LLM能够捕获时间上下文并通过显式编码处理缺失值；实验室变量则使用代表性汇总值或可学习的[未测量]标记进行嵌入。

Result: 在PhysioNet基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，VITAL优于为不规则时间序列设计的最先进方法，并在高缺失率情况下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: VITAL能够有效处理真实临床场景中常见的高缺失率问题，为不规则采样的生理时间序列建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling
time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical
variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and
intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large
language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly
sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct
types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and
exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured
sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the
language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over
missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are
embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not
measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the
benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state
of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it
maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is
prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often
unavailable.

Abstract: We present a machine learning pipeline for biomarker discovery in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), integrating eight publicly available microarray datasets from
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC). After robust preprocessing we
trained an XGBoost classifier optimized via Bayesian search. SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) were used to identify key features for model prediction,
indicating thus possible biomarkers. These were compared with genes identified
through classical Differential Expression Analysis (DEA). Our comparison
revealed both overlapping and unique biomarkers between SHAP and DEA,
suggesting complementary strengths. Enrichment analysis confirmed the
biological relevance of SHAP-selected genes, linking them to pathways such as
sphingolipid signaling, Th1/Th2/Th17 cell differentiation, and Epstein-Barr
virus infection all known to be associated with MS. This study highlights the
value of combining explainable AI (xAI) with traditional statistical methods to
gain deeper insights into disease mechanism.

*Moritz Piening,Robert Beinert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了双切片Wasserstein（DSW）距离作为Wasserstein over Wasserstein（WoW）距离的稳定高效替代方案，通过利用1D Wasserstein空间与分位数函数空间的等距性，避免了高阶矩的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的切片WoW加速方法依赖参数化元测度或高阶矩存在性，导致数值不稳定。需要一种更稳定、计算效率更高的方法来比较数据集或图像和形状的分布。

Method: 利用1D Wasserstein空间与L2([0,1])空间中分位数函数的等距性，引入任意Banach空间的通用切片Wasserstein框架，通过高斯过程参数化的无限维L2投影定义1D元测度的切片距离，结合欧几里得单位球上的经典积分得到DSW度量。

Result: DSW最小化与离散元测度的WoW最小化等价，但避免了不稳定的高阶矩并实现了计算节省。在数据集、形状和图像上的数值实验验证了DSW作为WoW距离可扩展替代方案的有效性。

Conclusion: DSW提供了一个稳定且计算高效的WoW距离替代方案，通过双重切片方法解决了现有方法的数值不稳定问题，同时保持了理论等价性和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Wasserstein distances define a metric between probability measures on
arbitrary metric spaces, including meta-measures (measures over measures). The
resulting Wasserstein over Wasserstein (WoW) distance is a powerful, but
computationally costly tool for comparing datasets or distributions over images
and shapes. Existing sliced WoW accelerations rely on parametric meta-measures
or the existence of high-order moments, leading to numerical instability. As an
alternative, we propose to leverage the isometry between the 1d Wasserstein
space and the quantile functions in the function space $L_2([0,1])$. For this
purpose, we introduce a general sliced Wasserstein framework for arbitrary
Banach spaces. Due to the 1d Wasserstein isometry, this framework defines a
sliced distance between 1d meta-measures via infinite-dimensional
$L_2$-projections, parametrized by Gaussian processes. Combining this 1d
construction with classical integration over the Euclidean unit sphere yields
the double-sliced Wasserstein (DSW) metric for general meta-measures. We show
that DSW minimization is equivalent to WoW minimization for discretized
meta-measures, while avoiding unstable higher-order moments and computational
savings. Numerical experiments on datasets, shapes, and images validate DSW as
a scalable substitute for the WoW distance.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的关键因素，提出了两种新的非线性函数并在监督学习和强化学习环境中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（可塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于负分支形状和饱和行为的属性分析，引入了两种即插即用的非线性函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky），并在监督类增量基准和强化学习非平稳环境中进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，经过深思熟虑的激活函数设计能够在不增加额外容量或任务特定调整的情况下，为持续学习提供轻量级、领域通用的可塑性维持方法。

Conclusion: 激活函数选择是缓解持续学习中可塑性损失的主要架构无关杠杆，合理的激活设计能够有效维持模型的适应能力。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习样本效率低，特别是在多任务设置中，这源于直接在高维冗余参数空间中优化策略。

Method: 训练生成模型将策略参数空间压缩到低维潜在空间，使用行为重建损失确保潜在空间按功能相似性组织。

Result: 在连续控制领域验证，标准策略网络的参数化可压缩高达五个数量级，同时保留大部分表达能力。

Conclusion: 学习的流形支持在潜在空间中进行策略梯度任务特定适应，环境复杂性而非网络大小决定内在维度。

Abstract: Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is
notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the
standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and
highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded
in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach
that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional
latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model
$g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which
ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than
proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality
of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the
size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control
domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be
compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its
expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables
task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space
$\mathcal{Z}$.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法通过策略熵来刺激探索，但机械的熵最大化容易因多轮分布偏移导致训练不稳定。本文旨在通过智能体自身经验指导下的渐进式探索-利用平衡，避免熵崩溃或失控发散。

Method: 扩展了基础自模仿学习框架，通过课程学习管理探索过程：使用内在奖励促进技能级探索，通过自模仿学习促进动作级探索。早期利用辅助工具调用奖励积累工具使用技能，后期加强自模仿以利用重放经验中的成功模式。还引入了优势重新校准和正则化来稳定训练。

Result: 该方法能够在训练过程中保持良好平衡的熵范围，既实现了广泛的技能探索，又加速了解决方案迭代，同时避免了无限制的熵增长。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过课程式自模仿学习有效解决了强化学习中的探索-利用权衡问题，提供了稳定且高效的代理LLM训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE)方法，通过使用分位数基线替代均值基线，解决了RLVR训练中的熵崩溃和熵爆炸问题，实现了稳定的熵控制和持续的推理性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中存在熵崩溃和熵爆炸的振荡问题，这源于基于均值的价值无关RL方法对负优势样本的不当惩罚，特别是在奖励异常值情况下。

Method: 提出QAE方法，用分组K-分位数基线替代均值基线，在困难查询中强化罕见成功，在简单查询中针对剩余失败，实现响应级别的双机制门控。

Result: QAE稳定了熵动态，稀疏化了信用分配（约80%响应获得零优势），在Qwen3-8B/14B-Base模型上对AIME 2024/2025和AMC 2023任务实现了持续的pass@1提升。

Conclusion: 基线设计（而非token级启发式方法）是扩展RLVR的主要机制，QAE为强化学习与可验证奖励提供了更稳定的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM
reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and
{entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in
value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes
negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile
Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile
baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <=
1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it
targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove
{two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy
change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal
modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K,
roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1
gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results
identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the
primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.

Motivation: ICL在数据稀缺场景下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应，但推理计算成本更高。研究能否利用ICL的内部计算来改进SFT的质量。

Method: 提出ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，通过让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式来激励ICL式的内部推理，并在SFT前作为预训练步骤执行。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，IA2显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实际应用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Result: 证明每个独立性准则都能在非线性、不可逆混合下实现潜在子空间的可识别性，并建立了这些准则之间的层次关系。

Conclusion: 该框架阐明了无需统计假设即可识别解耦表示的条件，为解耦学习提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Disentangled representations seek to recover latent factors of variation
underlying observed data, yet their identifiability is still not fully
understood. We introduce a unified framework in which disentanglement is
achieved through mechanistic independence, which characterizes latent factors
by how they act on observed variables rather than by their latent distribution.
This perspective is invariant to changes of the latent density, even when such
changes induce statistical dependencies among factors. Within this framework,
we propose several related independence criteria -- ranging from support-based
and sparsity-based to higher-order conditions -- and show that each yields
identifiability of latent subspaces, even under nonlinear, non-invertible
mixing. We further establish a hierarchy among these criteria and provide a
graph-theoretic characterization of latent subspaces as connected components.
Together, these results clarify the conditions under which disentangled
representations can be identified without relying on statistical assumptions.

Motivation: DFM是一个有前景的离散生成建模框架，通过训练神经网络来近似变换速度场来学习底层生成动态。本文旨在为DFM的端到端训练提供理论保证。

Method: 通过分解最终分布估计误差，首先证明生成分布与目标分布之间的总变差距离由学习到的速度场的风险控制，然后通过分析近似误差和估计误差来界定这个风险。

Result: 证明了当训练集规模增加时，训练后的DFM模型生成分布会以可证明的方式收敛到真实数据分布。

Conclusion: 这是第一个正式证明DFM模型生成分布会收敛到真实数据分布的理论分析，为DFM框架提供了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: We provide a theoretical analysis for end-to-end training Discrete Flow
Matching (DFM) generative models. DFM is a promising discrete generative
modeling framework that learns the underlying generative dynamics by training a
neural network to approximate the transformative velocity field. Our analysis
establishes a clear chain of guarantees by decomposing the final distribution
estimation error. We first prove that the total variation distance between the
generated and target distributions is controlled by the risk of the learned
velocity field. We then bound this risk by analyzing its two primary sources:
(i) Approximation Error, where we quantify the capacity of the Transformer
architecture to represent the true velocity, and (ii) Estimation Error, where
we derive statistical convergence rates that bound the error from training on a
finite dataset. By composing these results, we provide the first formal proof
that the distribution generated by a trained DFM model provably converges to
the true data distribution as the training set size increases.

Motivation: 解决多路数据插补问题，特别是动态图流中缺失值的估计，需要既灵活又参数高效的方法，同时能够融入图结构先验知识。

Method: 采用非参数化方法，将插补问题转化为再生核希尔伯特空间中的回归问题。使用固定张量训练秩的张量实现参数效率，并通过Hadamard过参数化在TT参数空间中促进稀疏性。学习过程通过求解固定TT秩张量黎曼流形上的光滑逆问题实现。

Conclusion: KReTTaH提供了一个灵活且参数高效的框架，能够无缝融入图结构先验，在动态图流估计等应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: A regression-based framework for interpretable multi-way data imputation,
termed Kernel Regression via Tensor Trains with Hadamard overparametrization
(KReTTaH), is introduced. KReTTaH adopts a nonparametric formulation by casting
imputation as regression via reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Parameter
efficiency is achieved through tensors of fixed tensor-train (TT) rank, which
reside on low-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and is further enhanced via
Hadamard overparametrization, which promotes sparsity within the TT parameter
space. Learning is accomplished by solving a smooth inverse problem posed on
the Riemannian manifold of fixed TT-rank tensors. As a representative
application, the estimation of dynamic graph flows is considered. In this
setting, KReTTaH exhibits flexibility by seamlessly incorporating graph-based
(topological) priors via its inverse problem formulation. Numerical tests on
real-world graph datasets demonstrate that KReTTaH consistently outperforms

*Ehsan Futuhi,Nathan R. Sturtevant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在启发式学习中强制可采纳性的方法（CEA损失函数），并在魔方问题上实现了接近可采纳且比压缩模式数据库更强的启发式函数。同时，通过利用PDB抽象和图结构特性，为A*算法的泛化提供了理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习启发式学习方法往往忽视可采纳性要求，且对训练数据之外的泛化能力缺乏理论保证。本文旨在同时解决这两个局限性。

Method: 1. 将启发式学习构建为约束优化问题，提出交叉熵可采纳性（CEA）损失函数；2. 利用PDB抽象和图结构特性分析学习启发式的样本复杂度；3. 使用ReLU神经网络替代一般假设类，提供泛化保证。

Result: 在魔方问题上，CEA方法产生了接近可采纳的启发式函数，其指导能力显著强于压缩模式数据库启发式。理论分析表明，网络宽度和深度而非图大小主导泛化边界。

Conclusion: 本文同时解决了启发式学习中的可采纳性要求和泛化保证问题，为基于深度学习的启发式搜索提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Heuristic functions are central to the performance of search algorithms such
as A-star, where admissibility - the property of never overestimating the true
shortest-path cost - guarantees solution optimality. Recent deep learning
approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on
generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these
limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization
problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that
enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method
yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than
compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the
sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and
the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the
bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize.
Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds
that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph
size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization
guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics.

TL;DR: 论文证明当模型参数数量p超过数据维度d与样本数n的乘积时，可以从模型参数中重建整个训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型的数据记忆能力，从数据重建角度分析模型参数与训练数据的关系。

Method: 在随机特征模型中，当p >> dn时，特征空间中训练样本张成的子空间包含足够信息来识别输入空间中的个体样本。提出了一种从模型参数重建数据集的优化方法。

Result: 该方法在多种架构（随机特征、两层全连接网络、深度残差网络）上表现良好，验证了当p超过dn阈值时能够重建整个训练数据集。

Conclusion: 揭示了数据重建定律：当模型参数数量p超过dn时，可以从模型参数中完全恢复训练数据集。

Abstract: Large-scale deep learning models are known to memorize parts of the training
set. In machine learning theory, memorization is often framed as interpolation
or label fitting, and classical results show that this can be achieved when the
number of parameters $p$ in the model is larger than the number of training
samples $n$. In this work, we consider memorization from the perspective of
data reconstruction, demonstrating that this can be achieved when $p$ is larger
than $dn$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the data. More specifically, we
show that, in the random features model, when $p \gg dn$, the subspace spanned
by the training samples in feature space gives sufficient information to
identify the individual samples in input space. Our analysis suggests an
optimization method to reconstruct the dataset from the model parameters, and
we demonstrate that this method performs well on various architectures (random
features, two-layer fully-connected and deep residual networks). Our results
reveal a law of data reconstruction, according to which the entire training
dataset can be recovered as $p$ exceeds the threshold $dn$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆私人或敏感知识，带来隐私风险。现有的遗忘方法容易在后续训练中被重新学习，导致遗忘的知识重新出现，存在浅层对齐问题。

Method: 提出Ssiuu遗忘方法，采用属性引导的正则化来防止虚假的负影响，忠实移除目标知识。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发鲁棒且忠实的遗忘方法对于语言模型安全部署的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models trained on web-scale data can memorize private or
sensitive knowledge, raising significant privacy risks. Although some
unlearning methods mitigate these risks, they remain vulnerable to "relearning"
during subsequent training, allowing a substantial portion of forgotten
knowledge to resurface. In this paper, we show that widely used unlearning
methods cause shallow alignment: instead of faithfully erasing target
knowledge, they generate spurious unlearning neurons that amplify negative
influence to hide it. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Ssiuu, a new
class of unlearning methods that employs attribution-guided regularization to
prevent spurious negative influence and faithfully remove target knowledge.
Experimental results confirm that our method reliably erases target knowledge
and outperforms strong baselines across two practical retraining scenarios: (1)
adversarial injection of private data, and (2) benign attack using an
instruction-following benchmark. Our findings highlight the necessity of robust
and faithful unlearning methods for safe deployment of language models.

Conclusion: 研究强调了无泄露评估协议的重要性，为数据集划分、模型选择和验证提供了实用指南，有助于开发更可靠的工业故障诊断ML系统。

Abstract: Reliable detection of bearing faults is essential for maintaining the safety
and operational efficiency of rotating machinery. While recent advances in
machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, have shown strong
performance in controlled settings, many studies fail to generalize to
real-world applications due to methodological flaws, most notably data leakage.
This paper investigates the issue of data leakage in vibration-based bearing
fault diagnosis and its impact on model evaluation. We demonstrate that common
dataset partitioning strategies, such as segment-wise and condition-wise
splits, introduce spurious correlations that inflate performance metrics. To
address this, we propose a rigorous, leakage-free evaluation methodology
centered on bearing-wise data partitioning, ensuring no overlap between the
physical components used for training and testing. Additionally, we reformulate
the classification task as a multi-label problem, enabling the detection of
co-occurring fault types and the use of prevalence-independent metrics such as
Macro AUROC. Beyond preventing leakage, we also examine the effect of dataset
diversity on generalization, showing that the number of unique training
bearings is a decisive factor for achieving robust performance. We evaluate our
methodology on three widely adopted datasets: CWRU, Paderborn University (PU),
and University of Ottawa (UORED-VAFCLS). This study highlights the importance
of leakage-aware evaluation protocols and provides practical guidelines for
dataset partitioning, model selection, and validation, fostering the
development of more trustworthy ML systems for industrial fault diagnosis
applications.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多样化应用中的集成，获取可靠的预测不确定性度量变得至关重要。需要精确区分来自输入数据固有模糊性的偶然不确定性和来自模型局限性的认知不确定性。

Method: 利用量子信息理论中的冯·诺依曼熵，提供严格的理论基础来分离总不确定性为不同的偶然和认知成分。该方法结合了语义相似性的细粒度表示，能够在模型响应中对各种语义解释进行细致区分。

Result: 实证评估表明，Spectral Uncertainty在估计偶然不确定性和总不确定性方面优于现有最先进方法，在多样化模型和基准数据集上表现出色。

Conclusion: Spectral Uncertainty方法为LLMs的不确定性量化和分解提供了有效的解决方案，在理论和实证层面都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in diverse
applications, obtaining reliable measures of their predictive uncertainty has
become critically important. A precise distinction between aleatoric
uncertainty, arising from inherent ambiguities within input data, and epistemic
uncertainty, originating exclusively from model limitations, is essential to
effectively address each uncertainty source. In this paper, we introduce
Spectral Uncertainty, a novel approach to quantifying and decomposing
uncertainties in LLMs. Leveraging the Von Neumann entropy from quantum
information theory, Spectral Uncertainty provides a rigorous theoretical
foundation for separating total uncertainty into distinct aleatoric and
epistemic components. Unlike existing baseline methods, our approach
incorporates a fine-grained representation of semantic similarity, enabling
nuanced differentiation among various semantic interpretations in model
responses. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Spectral Uncertainty
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in estimating both aleatoric and total
uncertainty across diverse models and benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有的MoE架构在NLP中表现优异，但在时间序列分析中由于任务无关的路由器和缺乏通道相关性建模能力而表现不足

Method: 提出PatchMoE框架，包含循环噪声门控机制利用层次信息进行路由，设计时空负载平衡损失来建模复杂的时间通道相关性

Result: 在五个下游任务上的综合实验证明了PatchMoE的最先进性能

Conclusion: PatchMoE是一个通用且有效的MoE时间序列框架，能够支持不同任务的复杂知识利用

Abstract: Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.

Conclusion: 扩散自编码器模型为无线语义通信提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够更好地探索信号分布并解决传统架构的可扩展性问题

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a "domain translation" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a "semantic-to-clean" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to "steer" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.

TL;DR: 提出基于多目标非凸约束松弛模型的高效超图划分框架，使用改进的加速近端梯度算法生成多样化顶点特征，结合MST策略和细化策略，在公开基准测试中优于多个先进划分器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统超图划分方法容易陷入局部最优和划分质量不足的问题，特别是在大规模数据和加权顶点集上的划分挑战。

Method: 使用多目标非凸约束松弛模型和加速近端梯度算法生成顶点特征；针对不同数据规模采用两种MST策略（小数据用Prim算法构建MST后剪枝聚类，大数据选代表节点构建小MST）；引入贪心迁移、交换和递归MST聚类等细化策略。

Result: 在2、3、4路划分中平均比KaHyPar减少2%-5%的割边大小，特定实例提升达35%；在加权顶点集上优于KaHyPar、hMetis、Mt-KaHyPar和K-SpecPart；细化策略可将hMetis划分结果提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该算法在超图划分质量上具有显著优势，特别是在加权顶点集上表现优异，验证了其竞争力和性能权衡特征。

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient hypergraph partitioning framework based on a
novel multi-objective non-convex constrained relaxation model. A modified
accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is employed to generate diverse
$k$-dimensional vertex features to avoid local optima and enhance partition
quality. Two MST-based strategies are designed for different data scales: for
small-scale data, the Prim algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
followed by pruning and clustering; for large-scale data, a subset of
representative nodes is selected to build a smaller MST, while the remaining
nodes are assigned accordingly to reduce complexity. To further improve
partitioning results, refinement strategies including greedy migration,
swapping, and recursive MST-based clustering are introduced for partitions.
  Experimental results on public benchmark sets demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm achieves reductions in cut size of approximately 2\%--5\% on average
compared to KaHyPar in 2, 3, and 4-way partitioning, with improvements of up to
35\% on specific instances. Particularly on weighted vertex sets, our algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art partitioners including KaHyPar, hMetis,
Mt-KaHyPar, and K-SpecPart, highlighting its superior partitioning quality and
competitiveness. Furthermore, the proposed refinement strategy improves hMetis
partitions by up to 16\%. A comprehensive evaluation based on virtual instance
methodology and parameter sensitivity analysis validates the algorithm's
competitiveness and characterizes its performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: Aurora通过有效整合多模态领域知识，显著提升了跨域时间序列预测的泛化能力，支持零样本推理，为时间序列基础模型的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.

Abstract: Computational representations have become crucial in unlocking the recent
growth of machine learning algorithms for chemistry. Initially hand-designed,
machine learning has shown that meaningful representations can be learnt from
data. Chemical datasets are limited and so the representations learnt from data
are generic, being trained on broad datasets which contain shallow information
on many different molecule types. For example, generic fingerprints lack
physical context specific to solvents. However, the use of harmful solvents is
a leading climate-related issue in the chemical industry, and there is a surge
of interest in green solvent replacement. To empower this research, we propose
a new solvent representation scheme by developing Solvent Data Driven
Embeddings (SoDaDE). SoDaDE uses a small transformer model and solvent property
dataset to create a fingerprint for solvents. To showcase their effectiveness,
we use SoDaDE to predict yields on a recently published dataset, outperforming
previous representations. We demonstrate through this paper that data-driven
fingerprints can be made with small datasets and set-up a workflow that can be
explored for other applications.

Abstract: Deep neural networks learn feature representations via complex geometric
transformations of the input data manifold. Despite the models' empirical
success across domains, our understanding of neural feature representations is
still incomplete. In this work we investigate neural feature geometry through
the lens of discrete geometry. Since the input data manifold is typically
unobserved, we approximate it using geometric graphs that encode local
similarity structure. We provide theoretical results on the evolution of these
graphs during training, showing that nonlinear activations play a crucial role
in shaping feature geometry in feedforward neural networks. Moreover, we
discover that the geometric transformations resemble a discrete Ricci flow on
these graphs, suggesting that neural feature geometry evolves analogous to
Ricci flow. This connection is supported by experiments on over 20,000
feedforward neural networks trained on binary classification tasks across both
synthetic and real-world datasets. We observe that the emergence of class
separability corresponds to the emergence of community structure in the
associated graph representations, which is known to relate to discrete Ricci
flow dynamics. Building on these insights, we introduce a novel framework for
locally evaluating geometric transformations through comparison with discrete
Ricci flow dynamics. Our results suggest practical design principles, including
a geometry-informed early-stopping heuristic and a criterion for selecting
network depth.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本LLMs的思维链往往不忠实，但LALMs中该问题尚未研究。由于LALMs需要先从音频中提取线索再进行推理，其忠实性对安全敏感应用至关重要。

Method: 应用多种针对性干预方法：改写、填充标记注入、提前回答和引入错误，在SAKURA和MMAR两个推理数据集上测试多个LALMs。

Result: 经过多种干预测试后，实验表明LALMs生成的CoT总体上忠实于其底层决策过程。

Conclusion: 与文本LLMs不同，LALMs产生的思维链在多个数据集和任务中表现出良好的忠实性。

Abstract: Faithfulness measures whether chain-of-thought (CoT) representations
accurately reflect a model's decision process and can be used as reliable
explanations. Prior work has shown that CoTs from text-based LLMs are often
unfaithful. This question has not been explored for large audio-language models
(LALMs), where faithfulness is critical for safety-sensitive applications.
Reasoning in LALMs is also more challenging, as models must first extract
relevant clues from audio before reasoning over them. In this paper, we
investigate the faithfulness of CoTs produced by several LALMs by applying
targeted interventions, including paraphrasing, filler token injection, early
answering, and introducing mistakes, on two challenging reasoning datasets:
SAKURA and MMAR. After going through the aforementioned interventions across
several datasets and tasks, our experiments suggest that, LALMs generally
produce CoTs that appear to be faithful to their underlying decision processes.

Result: 在TR-OP数据集上，融合头达到97.5%准确率和2.4%误报率；图像子集达到95.5%准确率和5.9%误报率；WebPhish数据集上HTML检测达到96.5%准确率和1.8%误报率。

Conclusion: 桶聚合与硬门控专家相结合，能够在严格隐私保护下实现稳定的联邦训练，同时提高多模态钓鱼检测的可用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We present a federated, multi-modal phishing website detector that supports
URL, HTML, and IMAGE inputs without binding clients to a fixed modality at
inference: any client can invoke any modality head trained elsewhere.
Methodologically, we propose role-aware bucket aggregation on top of FedProx,
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts and FedMM. We drop learnable routing and use
hard gating (selecting the IMAGE/HTML/URL expert by sample modality), enabling
separate aggregation of modality-specific parameters to isolate cross-embedding
conflicts and stabilize convergence. On TR-OP, the Fusion head reaches Acc
97.5% with FPR 2.4% across two data types; on the image subset (ablation) it
attains Acc 95.5% with FPR 5.9%. For text, we use GraphCodeBERT for URLs and an
early three-way embedding for raw, noisy HTML. On WebPhish (HTML) we obtain Acc
96.5% / FPR 1.8%; on TR-OP (raw HTML) we obtain Acc 95.1% / FPR 4.6%. Results
indicate that bucket aggregation with hard-gated experts enables stable
federated training under strict privacy, while improving the usability and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在信用风险评估中面临高维数据、可解释性差、罕见事件检测和多类不平衡等挑战，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 构建元学习框架，整合监督学习算法（XGBoost、随机森林、SVM、决策树）、无监督方法（KNN）、深度学习架构（多层感知机）、LASSO正则化进行特征选择，以及纠错输出码作为元分类器处理不平衡多类问题。

Abstract: Effective credit risk management is fundamental to financial decision-making,
necessitating robust models for default probability prediction and financial
entity classification. Traditional machine learning approaches face significant
challenges when confronted with high-dimensional data, limited
interpretability, rare event detection, and multi-class imbalance problems in
risk assessment. This research proposes a comprehensive meta-learning framework
that synthesizes multiple complementary models: supervised learning algorithms,
including XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree;
unsupervised methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors; deep learning architectures
like Multilayer Perceptron; alongside LASSO regularization for feature
selection and dimensionality reduction; and Error-Correcting Output Codes as a
meta-classifier for handling imbalanced multi-class problems. We implement
Permutation Feature Importance analysis for each prediction class across all
constituent models to enhance model transparency. Our framework aims to
optimize predictive performance while providing a more holistic approach to
credit risk assessment. This research contributes to the development of more
accurate and reliable computational models for strategic financial decision
support by addressing three fundamental challenges in credit risk modeling. The
empirical validation of our approach involves an analysis of the Corporate
Credit Ratings dataset with credit ratings for 2,029 publicly listed US
companies. Results demonstrate that our meta-learning framework significantly
enhances the accuracy of financial entity classification regarding credit
rating migrations (upgrades and downgrades) and default probability estimation.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在实际应用中广泛使用，但其内部结构和复杂性使其通常难以解释。模型透明度和可解释性是许多场景的关键要求，仅靠高性能不足以采用所提出的解决方案。

Method: 将可微L0正则化近似应用于基于逻辑的神经网络MLLP，并与随机二值化等替代启发式方法进行比较，研究基于损失函数的网络稀疏化技术是否能获得更好结果。

Result: 讨论了CRS复杂性与性能之间的权衡关系，比较了不同稀疏化方法的效果。

Conclusion: 使用基于损失函数的网络稀疏化技术可能比随机方法获得更好的结果，在保持性能的同时有效降低可解释模型的复杂性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely used in practical applications of AI,
however, their inner structure and complexity made them generally not easily
interpretable. Model transparency and interpretability are key requirements for
multiple scenarios where high performance is not enough to adopt the proposed
solution. In this work, a differentiable approximation of $L_0$ regularization
is adapted into a logic-based neural network, the Multi-layer Logical
Perceptron (MLLP), to study its efficacy in reducing the complexity of its
discrete interpretable version, the Concept Rule Set (CRS), while retaining its
performance. The results are compared to alternative heuristics like Random
Binarization of the network weights, to determine if better results can be
achieved when using a less-noisy technique that sparsifies the network based on
the loss function instead of a random distribution. The trade-off between the
CRS complexity and its performance is discussed.

Abstract: The decline in interest rates and economic stabilization has heightened the
importance of accurate mortality rate forecasting, particularly in insurance
and pension markets. Multi-step-ahead predictions are crucial for public
health, demographic planning, and insurance risk assessments; however, they
face challenges when data are limited. Hybrid systems that combine statistical
and Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising solution for handling both
linear and nonlinear patterns. This study evaluated the impact of different
multi-step forecasting approaches (Recursive, Direct, and Multi-Input
Multi-Output) and ML models on the accuracy of hybrid systems. Results from 12
datasets and 21 models show that the selection of both the multi-step approach
and the ML model is essential for improving performance, with the ARIMA-LSTM
hybrid using a recursive approach outperforming other models in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出ReLAM框架，通过从无动作视频演示中自动生成密集结构化奖励，解决视觉强化学习中奖励设计瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实世界视觉设置中，由于感知限制，无法获得精确的位置信息来设计奖励。传统基于目标位置距离的奖励设计方法在视觉RL中不可行。

Method: 首先学习一个作为规划器的预测模型，提出基于关键点的中间子目标；然后基于预测的子目标提供连续奖励信号，在分层强化学习框架下训练低层目标条件策略。

Result: 在复杂长视野操作任务上的广泛实验表明，ReLAM显著加速学习过程，并相比最先进方法获得更优性能。

Conclusion: ReLAM框架能够自动从视频演示中生成结构化奖励，有效解决视觉RL中的奖励设计问题，具有可证明的次优性边界。

Abstract: Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MoveFM-R框架，通过结合语言驱动的语义推理能力来释放移动基础模型的全部潜力，解决地理坐标与语言标记之间的词汇不匹配问题以及MFMs潜在向量与LLMs语义世界之间的表示差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动基础模型在建模人类移动模式方面取得了进展，但由于数据规模和语义理解的限制面临瓶颈。大型语言模型提供强大的语义推理能力，但缺乏生成物理合理移动轨迹所需的时空统计理解。

Method: 基于三个核心创新：语义增强的位置编码来弥合地理-语言差距，渐进式课程来对齐LLM推理与移动模式，以及用于条件轨迹生成的交互式自反机制。

Result: 大量实验表明MoveFM-R显著优于现有的MFM基和LLM基基线方法，在零样本设置下表现出强大的泛化能力，并能从自然语言指令生成真实轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将MFMs的统计能力与LLMs的深度语义理解相结合，MoveFM-R开创了一个新范式，实现了更全面、可解释和强大的人类移动建模。

Abstract: Mobility Foundation Models (MFMs) have advanced the modeling of human
movement patterns, yet they face a ceiling due to limitations in data scale and
semantic understanding. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful
semantic reasoning, they lack the innate understanding of spatio-temporal
statistics required for generating physically plausible mobility trajectories.
To address these gaps, we propose MoveFM-R, a novel framework that unlocks the
full potential of mobility foundation models by leveraging language-driven
semantic reasoning capabilities. It tackles two key challenges: the vocabulary
mismatch between continuous geographic coordinates and discrete language
tokens, and the representation gap between the latent vectors of MFMs and the
semantic world of LLMs. MoveFM-R is built on three core innovations: a
semantically enhanced location encoding to bridge the geography-language gap, a
progressive curriculum to align the LLM's reasoning with mobility patterns, and
an interactive self-reflection mechanism for conditional trajectory generation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoveFM-R significantly outperforms
existing MFM-based and LLM-based baselines. It also shows robust generalization
in zero-shot settings and excels at generating realistic trajectories from
natural language instructions. By synthesizing the statistical power of MFMs
with the deep semantic understanding of LLMs, MoveFM-R pioneers a new paradigm
that enables a more comprehensive, interpretable, and powerful modeling of
human mobility. The implementation of MoveFM-R is available online at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MoveFM-R-CDE7/.

Conclusion: 为动力学系统建模建立了新的数据驱动途径，能够高效预测复杂流动行为。

Abstract: The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE), rooted in kinetic theory, provides a
powerful framework for capturing complex flow behaviour by describing the
evolution of single-particle distribution functions (PDFs). Despite its
success, solving the LBE numerically remains computationally intensive due to
strict time-step restrictions imposed by collision kernels. Here, we introduce
a physics-informed neural operator framework for the LBE that enables
prediction over large time horizons without step-by-step integration,
effectively bypassing the need to explicitly solve the collision kernel. We
incorporate intrinsic moment-matching constraints of the LBE, along with global
equivariance of the full distribution field, enabling the model to capture the
complex dynamics of the underlying kinetic system. Our framework is
discretization-invariant, enabling models trained on coarse lattices to
generalise to finer ones (kinetic super-resolution). In addition, it is
agnostic to the specific form of the underlying collision model, which makes it
naturally applicable across different kinetic datasets regardless of the
governing dynamics. Our results demonstrate robustness across complex flow
scenarios, including von Karman vortex shedding, ligament breakup, and bubble
adhesion. This establishes a new data-driven pathway for modelling kinetic
systems.

TL;DR: 本文分析了图提示学习(GPL)的局限性，提出UniPrompt方法，通过释放预训练模型能力并保持图结构，在各种场景下实现强性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有GPL方法存在两个关键问题：(1)缺乏对提示机制的统一理解，不同策略在不同层面干预模型；(2)场景适应性有限，特别是在数据分布变化时泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出UniPrompt方法，通过理论分析发现表示级提示本质上等同于微调下游分类器，主张GPL应专注于释放预训练模型能力，让分类器适应下游场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniPrompt能有效整合各种预训练模型，在域内和跨域场景下均取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: 图提示学习应专注于释放预训练模型潜力，而非过度依赖提示策略，UniPrompt通过这一理念实现了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Graph Prompt Learning (GPL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that bridges
graph pretraining models and downstream scenarios, mitigating label dependency
and the misalignment between upstream pretraining and downstream tasks.
Although existing GPL studies explore various prompt strategies, their
effectiveness and underlying principles remain unclear. We identify two
critical limitations: (1) Lack of consensus on underlying mechanisms: Despite
current GPLs have advanced the field, there is no consensus on how prompts
interact with pretrained models, as different strategies intervene at varying
spaces within the model, i.e., input-level, layer-wise, and
representation-level prompts. (2) Limited scenario adaptability: Most methods
fail to generalize across diverse downstream scenarios, especially under data
distribution shifts (e.g., homophilic-to-heterophilic graphs). To address these
issues, we theoretically analyze existing GPL approaches and reveal that
representation-level prompts essentially function as fine-tuning a simple
downstream classifier, proposing that graph prompt learning should focus on
unleashing the capability of pretrained models, and the classifier adapts to
downstream scenarios. Based on our findings, we propose UniPrompt, a novel GPL
method that adapts any pretrained models, unleashing the capability of
pretrained models while preserving the structure of the input graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively integrate with various
pretrained models and achieve strong performance across in-domain and
cross-domain scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模点云数据持续同调计算的计算瓶颈问题，Vietoris-Rips复形的指数级复杂度限制了其在大规模数据上的应用，需要更高效的复形构造方法。

Method: 引入Flood复形，基于Alpha复形和Witness复形的优势，通过Delaunay三角剖分和小规模点云子集，构建被点云半径r球覆盖的单纯形，支持GPU并行化。

Result: 在3D点云数据上成功计算了数百万点的持续同调（最高维度2），在真实世界和合成数据的物体分类任务中性能优于其他PH方法和点云神经网络。

Conclusion: Flood复形为大规模点云数据的持续同调计算提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于几何或拓扑复杂的物体，证明了大规模PH计算在实际应用中的必要性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of computing persistent homology (PH) for large-scale
Euclidean point cloud data, aimed at downstream machine learning tasks, where
the exponential growth of the most widely-used Vietoris-Rips complex imposes
serious computational limitations. Although more scalable alternatives such as
the Alpha complex or sparse Rips approximations exist, they often still result
in a prohibitively large number of simplices. This poses challenges in the
complex construction and in the subsequent PH computation, prohibiting their
use on large-scale point clouds. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the
Flood complex, inspired by the advantages of the Alpha and Witness complex
constructions. Informally, at a given filtration value $r\geq 0$, the Flood
complex contains all simplices from a Delaunay triangulation of a small subset
of the point cloud $X$ that are fully covered by balls of radius $r$ emanating
from $X$, a process we call flooding. Our construction allows for efficient PH
computation, possesses several desirable theoretical properties, and is
amenable to GPU parallelization. Scaling experiments on 3D point cloud data
show that we can compute PH of up to dimension 2 on several millions of points.
Importantly, when evaluating object classification performance on real-world
and synthetic data, we provide evidence that this scaling capability is needed,
especially if objects are geometrically or topologically complex, yielding
performance superior to other PH-based methods and neural networks for point
cloud data.

TL;DR: 提出IPFM（逆泊松流匹配）蒸馏框架，加速静电生成模型采样，仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近或优于教师模型的样本质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静电生成模型如PFGM++在图像合成中表现出色，但依赖昂贵的ODE模拟生成样本，计算成本高。需要开发高效的蒸馏方法来加速采样过程。

Method: 将蒸馏重新表述为逆问题：学习一个生成器，使其诱导的静电场与教师模型匹配。推导出可处理的训练目标，当D→∞时，IPFM可恢复为扩散模型蒸馏方法SiD。

Result: IPFM生成的蒸馏生成器仅需少量函数评估即可达到接近教师模型甚至更优的样本质量。有限D值的蒸馏收敛速度快于D→∞（扩散模型）情况。

Conclusion: IPFM是有效的静电生成模型蒸馏框架，能显著加速采样过程，且有限D值的模型具有更优的优化和采样特性。

Abstract: Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.

Motivation: 传统优化方法在处理神经网络时暴露中间变量和约束给求解器，导致计算效率低下。需要一种更高效的优化方法来利用GPU加速神经网络输出和导数的计算。

Method: 采用降维公式，将神经网络视为"灰盒"，不向优化求解器暴露中间变量和约束，直接在GPU上评估网络输出和导数。

Result: 在MNIST图像分类器的对抗生成和电力系统安全约束最优潮流两个优化问题中，该方法相比全维公式实现了更快的求解速度和更少的迭代次数。

Conclusion: 降维公式在处理神经网络优化问题时具有显著优势，特别是在GPU加速环境下，能够有效提升求解效率。

Abstract: We propose a reduced-space formulation for optimizing over trained neural
networks where the network's outputs and derivatives are evaluated on a GPU. To
do this, we treat the neural network as a "gray box" where intermediate
variables and constraints are not exposed to the optimization solver. Compared
to the full-space formulation, in which intermediate variables and constraints
are exposed to the optimization solver, the reduced-space formulation leads to
faster solves and fewer iterations in an interior point method. We demonstrate
the benefits of this method on two optimization problems: Adversarial
generation for a classifier trained on MNIST images and security-constrained
optimal power flow with transient feasibility enforced using a neural network
surrogate.

Motivation: 传统的高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题，且传统效率技术（如蒸馏）可能损害模型性能。

Method: 1. 提出IIET，使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；2. 提出IIAD蒸馏方法，通过灵活阈值平衡性能-效率权衡。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比原始Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%；高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保持99.4%原始任务准确率；最高效变体在可比速度下比原始Transformer性能提升超过1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET和IIAD方法有效解决了高阶数值方法Transformer的性能-效率权衡问题，实现了性能提升与效率优化的良好平衡。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical
system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently,
Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular
in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into
Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two
pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being
sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to
become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be
reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The
second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to
adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of
this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode
decomposition.

Abstract: Constrained optimization is a powerful framework for enforcing requirements
on neural networks. These constrained deep learning problems are typically
solved using first-order methods on their min-max Lagrangian formulation, but
such approaches often suffer from oscillations and can fail to find all local
solutions. While the Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) addresses these issues,
practitioners often favor dual optimistic ascent schemes (PI control) on the
standard Lagrangian, which perform well empirically but lack formal guarantees.
In this paper, we establish a previously unknown equivalence between these
approaches: dual optimistic ascent on the Lagrangian is equivalent to gradient
descent-ascent on the Augmented Lagrangian. This finding allows us to transfer
the robust theoretical guarantees of the ALM to the dual optimistic setting,
proving it converges linearly to all local solutions. Furthermore, the
equivalence provides principled guidance for tuning the optimism
hyper-parameter. Our work closes a critical gap between the empirical success
of dual optimistic methods and their theoretical foundation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of

architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

TL;DR: JointDiff是一个新颖的扩散框架，能够同时生成连续时空数据和同步离散事件，在体育领域验证了其有效性，实现了多智能体轨迹和关键控球事件的联合建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型通常将连续数据和离散事件视为独立过程，这限制了在复杂系统中对两者交互的建模能力。需要弥合这一差距，构建能够统一处理连续和离散过程的生成框架。

Method: 提出了JointDiff扩散框架，通过CrossGuid条件操作实现多智能体领域的有效条件控制，支持弱控球者引导和文本引导两种可控生成场景。

Result: JointDiff在统一体育基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模对于构建真实可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 联合建模连续时空数据和同步离散事件是构建现实且可控的交互系统生成模型的关键，JointDiff框架为此提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

TL;DR: ECHO是一种新的解码器中心大型EEG模型范式，将EEG建模重新定义为序列到序列学习，通过捕捉信号、标签和任务之间的层次关系，实现无需参数更新的动态任务适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型EEG模型主要关注编码器架构，缺乏相应容量的解码器，限制了学习特征的充分利用。

Method: 采用序列到序列学习框架，在序列空间中捕捉信号、标签和任务的层次关系，并整合离散支持样本构建上下文提示。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，即使使用基本模型组件，ECHO在多任务设置中始终优于最先进的单任务LEM，展现出卓越的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: ECHO通过解码器中心的序列到序列学习范式，成功解决了现有EEG模型解码能力不足的问题，实现了更好的多任务泛化性能。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Bundle pricing refers to designing several product combinations (i.e.,
bundles) and determining their prices in order to maximize the expected profit.
It is a classic problem in revenue management and arises in many industries,
such as e-commerce, tourism, and video games. However, the problem is typically
intractable due to the exponential number of candidate bundles. In this paper,
we explore the usage of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in solving the
bundle pricing problem. Specifically, we first develop a graph representation
of the mixed bundling model (where every possible bundle is assigned with a
specific price) and then train a GCN to learn the latent patterns of optimal
bundles. Based on the trained GCN, we propose two inference strategies to
derive high-quality feasible solutions. A local-search technique is further
proposed to improve the solution quality. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed GCN-based framework. Using a GCN
trained on instances with 5 products, our methods consistently achieve
near-optimal solutions (better than 97%) with only a fraction of computational
time for problems of small to medium size. It also achieves superior solutions
for larger size of problems compared with other heuristic methods such as
bundle size pricing (BSP). The method can also provide high quality solutions
for instances with more than 30 products even for the challenging cases where
product utilities are non-additive.

Abstract: The northeastern region of the Czech Republic is among the most seismically
active areas in the country. The most frequent seismic events are
mining-induced since there used to be strong mining activity in the past.
However, natural tectonic events may also occur. In addition, seismic stations
often record explosions in quarries in the region. Despite the cessation of
mining activities, mine-induced seismic events still occur. Therefore, a rapid
differentiation between tectonic and anthropogenic events is still important.
  The region is currently monitored by the OKC seismic station in
Ostrava-Kr\'{a}sn\'{e} Pole built in 1983 which is a part of the Czech Regional
Seismic Network. The station has been providing digital continuous waveform
data at 100 Hz since 2007. In the years 1992--2002, the region was co-monitored
by the Seismic Polygon Fren\v{s}t\'{a}t (SPF) which consisted of five seismic
stations using a triggered STA/LTA system.
  In this study, we apply and compare machine learning methods to the SPF
dataset, which contains labeled records of tectonic and mining-induced events.
For binary classification, a Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network
and XGBoost achieved an F1-score of 0.94 -- 0.95, demonstrating the potential
of modern machine learning techniques for rapid event characterization.

TL;DR: 提出了EPO框架解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体的探索-利用级联失败问题，通过熵正则化、熵平滑和自适应权重机制，在ScienceWorld和ALFWorld上分别实现152%和19.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体训练的根本挑战：探索-利用级联失败，包括早期策略过早收敛和后期策略崩溃。

Method: 提出EPO框架，包含三个协同机制：(1)多轮设置中的熵正则化增强探索；(2)熵平滑正则化器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3)自适应阶段权重平衡训练中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现高达152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%的性能提升，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统RL根本不同的熵控制方法，EPO框架为LLM智能体训练提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EDGE评估协议，通过识别极端类别序列来更准确地评估类增量学习的性能分布，解决了传统采样方法低估性能方差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的类增量学习评估协议仅从少量随机序列中计算均值和方差，无法捕捉完整的性能分布范围，导致均值估计偏差和方差严重低估。

Method: 提出EDGE评估协议，利用任务间相似性与模型性能的正相关性，自适应地识别和采样极端类别序列，从而更接近真实性能分布。

Result: 实验表明EDGE能有效捕捉性能极值，提供更准确的分布边界估计，为模型选择和鲁棒性检查提供可行见解。

Conclusion: EDGE通过极端序列评估提供了更可靠的类增量学习性能分布表征，改进了现有评估方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合最优传输采样策略的Mean Flow框架，用于改进单步生成模型的保真度和多样性，在图像生成、图像到图像转换和点云生成等任务上取得了更好的推理精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配生成模型虽然在各领域取得了最先进的结果，但由于需要大量顺序采样步骤，推理速度较慢。Mean Flows提供了单步生成方法，但在许多连续领域中无法忠实逼近原始多步流匹配过程的行为。

Method: 将最优传输采样策略整合到Mean Flow框架中，使单步生成器能够更好地保持原始多步流过程的保真度和多样性。

Result: 在受控低维设置和高维任务（如图像生成、图像到图像转换和点云生成）上的实验表明，该方法在单步生成建模中实现了更优的推理精度。

Conclusion: 通过结合最优传输采样策略，提出的方法显著提升了单步生成模型的性能，在保持推理速度优势的同时，更好地保留了原始多步流匹配过程的生成质量。

Abstract: Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains
such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these
models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential
sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the
number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation
approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative
performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully
approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In
this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based
sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators
that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow
process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on
high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation,
and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了Caption-Regularized Policy Optimization (CapPO)框架，通过强制感知一致性来解决多模态大语言模型中视觉感知错误传播的问题，在数学和通用推理任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在整合视觉感知和符号推理时存在关键弱点：感知引发的错误会在推理链中传播。现有的强化学习微调方法未能解决视觉基础与后续推理过程之间的错位问题。

Method: CapPO框架包含两个关键机制：1)基于标题的一致性正则化，最小化基于原始图像和基于标题的响应之间的差异；2)KL加权优势估计方案，自适应缩放强化信号以增强感知一致的轨迹。

Result: 在5个数学相关和5个通用推理基准测试中，CapPO在基础Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型上实现了+6.0%的数学任务准确率提升和+2.4%的通用推理任务提升。消融研究证实了各组件有效性，错误分析显示CapPO显著减少了感知相关错误。

Conclusion: CapPO为改进多模态推理提供了一个简单而有效的框架，通过强制感知一致性显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at tasks that integrate visual
perception with symbolic reasoning, their performance is often undermined by a
critical vulnerability: perception-induced errors that propagate through the
reasoning chain. Current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, while
enhancing reasoning abilities, largely fail to address the underlying
misalignment between visual grounding and the subsequent reasoning process. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Caption-Regularized Policy
Optimization (CapPO)}, a novel RL framework that explicitly enforces perceptual
consistency during policy optimization. CapPO integrates two key mechanisms:
(1) a caption-based consistency regularization, which minimizes the divergence
between responses conditioned on raw images and those conditioned on captions,
thereby anchoring reasoning to semantically faithful visual content; and (2) a
KL-weighted advantage estimation scheme, which adaptively scales reinforcement
signals to strengthen perceptually consistent trajectories while suppressing
spurious correlations. Extensive experiments on five math-focused and five
general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CapPO achieves competitive
performance, yielding gains of +6.0% accuracy on math-related tasks and +2.4%
on general reasoning tasks over the base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Moreover,
ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while
error analysis reveals that CapPO significantly reduces perception-related
mistakes compared with baselines. Overall, CapPO provides a simple yet
effective framework for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce QueryGym, an interactive environment for building, testing, and
evaluating LLM-based query planning agents. Existing frameworks often tie
agents to specific query language dialects or obscure their reasoning; QueryGym
instead requires agents to construct explicit sequences of relational algebra
operations, ensuring engine-agnostic evaluation and transparent step-by-step
planning. The environment is implemented as a Gymnasium interface that supplies
observations -- including schema details, intermediate results, and execution
feedback -- and receives actions that represent database exploration (e.g.,
previewing tables, sampling column values, retrieving unique values) as well as
relational algebra operations (e.g., filter, project, join). We detail the
motivation and the design of the environment. In the demo, we showcase the
utility of the environment by contrasting it with contemporary LLMs that query
databases. QueryGym serves as a practical testbed for research in error
remediation, transparency, and reinforcement learning for query generation. For

Abstract: Discretizing raw features into bucketized attribute representations is a
popular step before sharing a dataset. It is, however, evident that this step
can cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.
  In this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning
problem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization
to equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets.
Defining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning
must select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic
programming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased
binning problem.
  Finding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness,
or it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different
distributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be
tolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem
that bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We
first develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal
binning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale
to very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm,
based on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of
the LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a
near-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C
finds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm
then initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to
find the optimal solution.

methodology for transforming raw RFID and POS data into a structured analytical
data warehouse. A detailed logical database model is proposed, designed for
comprehensive analysis that combines financial sales metrics with behavioral

benefits of RFID implementation through the lens of the Balanced Scorecard

Conclusion: I-ETL框架成功解决了医疗数据异构性问题，将互操作性作为集成管道的核心要素，促进了医疗机构间的合作。

Abstract: Clinicians are interested in better understanding complex diseases, such as
cancer or rare diseases, so they need to produce and exchange data to mutualize
sources and join forces. To do so and ensure privacy, a natural way consists in
using a decentralized architecture and Federated Learning algorithms. This
ensures that data stays in the organization in which it has been collected, but
requires data to be collected in similar settings and similar models. In
practice, this is often not the case because healthcare institutions work
individually with different representations and raw data; they do not have
means to normalize their data, and even less to do so across centers. For
instance, clinicians have at hand phenotypic, clinical, imaging and genomic
data (each individually collected) and want to better understand some diseases
by analyzing them together. This example highlights the needs and challenges
for a cooperative use of this wealth of information. We designed and
implemented a framework, named I-ETL, for integrating highly heterogeneous
healthcare datasets of hospitals in interoperable databases. Our proposal is
twofold: (i) we devise two general and extensible conceptual models for
modeling both data and metadata and (ii) we propose an Extract-Transform-Load
(ETL) pipeline ensuring and assessing interoperability from the start. By
conducting experiments on open-source datasets, we show that I-ETL succeeds in
representing various health datasets in a unified way thanks to our two general
conceptual models. Next, we demonstrate the importance of blending
interoperability as a first-class citizen in integration pipelines, ensuring
possible collaboration between different centers.

*Yunlong Zhu,Chang-An Zhao*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩展代数几何码和Roth-Lempel型代数几何码，包括它们的对偶码和最小距离，并证明了某些情况下g-MDS码的长度可以达到q+1+2g√q，同时确定了扩展代数几何码的覆盖半径有g+2个可能值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献主要关注扩展Reed-Solomon码及其对偶码和覆盖半径，但对扩展代数几何码（g≥1）的研究较少，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过研究扩展代数几何码和Roth-Lempel型代数几何码，分析它们的对偶码和最小距离，并利用最大曲线构造扩展代数几何码。

Result: 证明了对于某些g，g-MDS码的长度可以达到q+1+2g√q，且在某些小有限域中这是已知g-MDS码的最大长度；同时确定了扩展代数几何码的覆盖半径有g+2个可能值，在g=1时当长度足够大或存在[n,k+1]MDS椭圆码时，该范围减少到两个可能值。

Conclusion: 扩展代数几何码在特定条件下可以达到理论上的最大长度，且其覆盖半径具有明确的范围，这为代数几何码的研究提供了新的理论结果。

Abstract: Many literatures consider the extended Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, including
their dual codes and covering radii, but few focus on extended algebraic
geometry (AG) codes of genus $g\ge1$. In this paper, we investigate extended AG
codes and Roth-Lempel type AG codes, including their dual codes and minimum
distances. Moreover, we show that for certain $g$, the length of a $g$-MDS code
over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ can attain $q+1+2g\sqrt{q}$, which is
achieved by an extended AG code from the maximal curves of genus $g$. Notably,
for some small finite fields, this length $q+1+2g\sqrt{q}$ is the largest among
all known $g$-MDS codes. Subsequently, we establish that the covering radius of
an $[n,k]$ extended AG code has $g+2$ possible values. For the case of $g=1$,
we prove that this range reduces to two possible values when the length $n$ is
sufficiently large, or when there exists an $[n,k+1]$ MDS elliptic code.

*Israel Jesus Santos Filho,Muhammad Mahboob Ur Rahman,Taous-Meriem Laleg-Kirati,Tareq Al-Naffouri*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于6G/WiFi集成感知通信系统的非接触式数字孪生光电容积脉搏波信号合成方法，使用软件定义无线电采集胸部的反射信号，并通过AI模型生成DT-PPG信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发非接触式数字孪生生物信号监测方法，实现早期疾病诊断和个性化治疗，特别针对COVID-19、心血管疾病和特殊需求人群的健康评估。

Method: 使用5.23 GHz软件定义无线电照射人体胸部并收集反射信号，构建包含300分钟数据的Radio-PPG数据集，测试两种AI模型：离散余弦变换+多层感知机，以及级联U-NET模型（近似网络和细化网络）配合自定义损失函数。

Result: U-NET模型取得了0.194的相对平均绝对误差，ISAC感知开销仅为15.62%，合成的DT-PPG信号在生命体征估计和特征提取方面的准确性与参考PPG相当。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生成式AI和6G/WiFi ISAC技术在非接触式健康监测中的潜力，为开发COVID-19、心血管疾病筛查工具和特殊需求人群健康评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Digital twins for 1D bio-signals enable real-time monitoring of physiological
processes of a person, which enables early disease diagnosis and personalized
treatment. This work introduces a novel non-contact method for digital twin
(DT) photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal synthesis under the umbrella of 6G/WiFi
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. We employ a
software-defined radio (SDR) operating at 5.23 GHz that illuminates the chest
of a nearby person with a wideband 6G/WiFi signal and collects the reflected
signals. This allows us to acquire Radio-PPG dataset that consists of 300
minutes worth of near synchronous 64-channel radio data, PPG data, along with
the labels (three body vitals) of 30 healthy subjects. With this, we test two
artificial intelligence (AI) models for DT-PPG signal synthesis: i) discrete
cosine transform followed by a multi-layer perceptron, ii) two U-NET models
(Approximation network, Refinement network) in cascade, along with a custom
loss function. Experimental results indicate that U-NET model achieves an
impressive relative mean absolute error of 0.194 with a small ISAC sensing
overhead of 15.62%, for DT-PPG synthesis. Furthermore, we performed quality
assessment of the synthetic DT-PPG by computing the accuracy of DT-PPG-based
vitals estimation and feature extraction, which turned out to be at par with
that of reference PPG-based vitals estimation and feature extraction. This work
highlights the potential of generative AI and 6G/WiFi ISAC technologies and
serves as a foundational step towards the development of non-contact screening
tools for covid-19, cardiovascular diseases and well-being assessment of people
with special needs.

Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) is emerging as a key technology for enhancing
spatial flexibility and sensing accuracy in future wireless systems. This paper
investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled FAS for multi-target
wireless sensing in low-altitude wireless consumer networks (LAWCNs) for
achieving the low-altitude economy (LAE) missions. We formulate an optimization
problem aimed at minimizing the average Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for multiple
target estimations. To tackle this non-convex problem, an efficient alternating
optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed, which jointly optimizes the UAV
trajectory, the antenna position of the transmit fluid antennas (FAs) and the
receive FAs, and the transmit beamforming at the UAV. Simulation results
demonstrate significant performance improvements in estimation accuracy and
sensing reliability compared to conventional schemes, e.g., the fixed position
antenna scheme. The proposed system achieves enhanced sensing performance
through adaptive trajectory design and beamforming, alongside effective
interference suppression via the flexible FAS antenna repositioning,
underscoring its practical potential for precision sensing in the UAV-enabled
LAWCNs.

*Ana Rodrigues,João Mata,Rui Rego*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型和自定义KNN算法的混合系统，用于直观的物品相似性搜索，提供更好的可解释性和搜索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒密集向量系统缺乏可解释性的问题，通过将自然语言查询转换为结构化搜索，弥合人类语言与机器可理解物品表示之间的差距。

Method: 使用LLM将自然语言查询转换为基于属性的结构化搜索，然后输入到采用BallTree搜索策略的自定义KNN算法中，使用异构距离度量来保持不同数据类型。

Result: 在500条葡萄酒评论数据集上的评估显示，LLM在信息提取中F1得分为0.9779，Jaro字符串相似度为0.9321。使用LLM重新排序的KNN算法在召回率上有显著提升(p=0.013)。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了LLM和KNN算法，提供了透明且细致的搜索能力，能够识别并提升符合用户细微意图的相关物品。

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid system for intuitive item similarity search that
combines a Large Language Model (LLM) with a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
algorithm. Unlike black-box dense vector systems, this architecture provides
superior interpretability by first using an LLM to convert natural language
queries into structured, attribute-based searches. This structured query then
serves as input to a custom KNN algorithm with a BallTree search strategy,
which uses a heterogeneous distance metric to preserve distinct data types. Our
evaluation, conducted on a dataset of 500 wine reviews, demonstrates the
system's effectiveness. The LLM achieved an F1-score of 0.9779 in information
extraction, while also demonstrating high fidelity with a Jaro string
similarity of 0.9321. When we augmented the KNN algorithm with LLM-based
re-ranking, we observed a statistically significant improvement in recall
(p=0.013), indicating the LLM's ability to identify and promote relevant items
that align with nuanced user intent. This approach effectively bridges the gap
between human language and machine-understandable item representations,
offering a transparent and nuanced search capability.

### [251] [Cross-Modal Retrieval with Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21339)
*Jiahao Zhang,Wenzhe Yin,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出基于Cauchy-Schwarz散度的跨模态检索方法，通过广义CS散度支持多模态对齐，无需超参数调整，在六个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索方法主要关注双模态任务，使用KL散度、MMD等分布对齐技术，存在数值不稳定、超参数敏感、无法捕捉完整分布结构等问题。

Method: 引入Cauchy-Schwarz散度作为超参数自由的对齐度量，并提出基于Hölder不等式的广义CS散度，通过双向循环比较方案直接对齐三个或更多模态。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在双模态和三模态检索任务中均有效，提高了训练稳定性和检索性能。

Conclusion: CS/GCS散度为跨模态检索提供了一种高效、稳定的分布对齐方法，支持多模态直接对齐，代码已开源。

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous
data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on
distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence,
Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods
often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability,
sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full
structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the
Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves
both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel
Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This
extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified
mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme,
eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments
on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both
bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is
publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.

*Gurbinder Gill,Ritvik Gupta,Denis Lusson,Anand Chandrashekar,Donald Nguyen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的分类框架(L1-L5)来基于数据模态和任务复杂度对问答系统进行分类，并评估了四种最先进平台在多模态检索和动态编排方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于文本语义搜索的RAG在处理超越数据摘要或非文本数据的问题时存在不足，需要补充技术来弥合RAG实现范式与企业用户期望解决的问题之间的差距。

Method: 提出了L1-L5分类框架，创建了与这些级别对齐的基准，并评估了LangChain、Azure AI Search、OpenAI和Corvic AI四种平台，重点关注多空间检索和动态编排能力。

Result: 实验表明多空间检索和动态编排对于实现L1-L4能力具有重要价值，通过针对企业用例的多样化数据集进行了实证验证。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为理解和评估RAG系统提供了问题导向的视角，多模态检索和动态编排是实现更高级别问答能力的关键技术。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the standard paradigm for
answering questions on enterprise data. Traditionally, RAG has centered on
text-based semantic search and re-ranking. However, this approach falls short
when dealing with questions beyond data summarization or non-text data. This
has led to various attempts to supplement RAG to bridge the gap between RAG,
the implementation paradigm, and the question answering problem that enterprise
users expect it to solve. Given that contemporary RAG is a collection of
techniques rather than a defined implementation, discussion of RAG and related
question-answering systems benefits from a problem-oriented understanding.
  We propose a new classification framework (L1-L5) to categorize systems based
on data modalities and task complexity of the underlying question answering
problems: L1 (Surface Knowledge of Unstructured Data) through L4 (Reflective
and Reasoned Knowledge) and the aspirational L5 (General Intelligence). We also
introduce benchmarks aligned with these levels and evaluate four
state-of-the-art platforms: LangChain, Azure AI Search, OpenAI, and Corvic AI.
Our experiments highlight the value of multi-space retrieval and dynamic
orchestration for enabling L1-L4 capabilities. We empirically validate our
findings using diverse datasets indicative of enterprise use cases.

TL;DR: PIR-RAG是一个实用的隐私保护RAG系统，通过语义聚类和快速PIR协议实现高效检索，显著降低RAG工作流的端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统存在严重的隐私风险，会将用户查询暴露给服务提供商，需要开发隐私保护的解决方案。

Method: 采用粗粒度语义聚类来修剪搜索空间，结合基于格的快速私有信息检索协议，优化端到端RAG工作流。

Result: 与基于图的PIR和Tiptoe式私有评分等基线架构相比，PIR-RAG在可扩展性和"RAG就绪延迟"方面表现优越。

Conclusion: PIR-RAG是大型AI系统中隐私保护的高效可行解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a foundational component of
modern AI systems, yet it introduces significant privacy risks by exposing user
queries to service providers. To address this, we introduce PIR-RAG, a
practical system for privacy-preserving RAG. PIR-RAG employs a novel
architecture that uses coarse-grained semantic clustering to prune the search
space, combined with a fast, lattice-based Private Information Retrieval (PIR)
protocol. This design allows for the efficient retrieval of entire document
clusters, uniquely optimizing for the end-to-end RAG workflow where full
document content is required. Our comprehensive evaluation against strong
baseline architectures, including graph-based PIR and Tiptoe-style private
scoring, demonstrates PIR-RAG's scalability and its superior performance in
terms of "RAG-Ready Latency"-the true end-to-end time required to securely
fetch content for an LLM. Our work establishes PIR-RAG as a viable and highly
efficient solution for privacy in large-scale AI systems.

*Guohang Yan,Yue Zhang,Pinlong Cai,Ding Wang,Song Mao,Hongwei Zhang,Yaoze Zhang,Hairong Zhang,Xinyu Cai,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了HetaRAG框架，通过融合向量索引、知识图谱、全文引擎和结构化数据库等多种检索模式，解决传统RAG系统单一存储后端带来的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常只使用单一存储后端（如向量数据库），存在不可避免的权衡：向量搜索捕获语义相似性但丢失全局上下文；知识图谱擅长关系精确性但召回率低；全文索引快速准确但语义盲；关系数据库提供强事务保证但无语义理解。这些异构检索范式是互补的。

Method: 设计HetaRAG框架，将向量索引、知识图谱、全文引擎和结构化数据库统一到单一检索平面，通过原则性融合方案协同编排跨模态证据，动态路由和融合证据以最大化召回率、精确度和上下文保真度。

Result: 构建了初步的RAG流水线，部分代码已在GitHub上开源。

Conclusion: 异构检索范式具有互补性，通过协同编排可以减轻单一模态的弱点，HetaRAG框架为解决传统RAG系统的局限性提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a dominant paradigm for
mitigating knowledge hallucination and staleness in large language models
(LLMs) while preserving data security. By retrieving relevant evidence from
private, domain-specific corpora and injecting it into carefully engineered
prompts, RAG delivers trustworthy responses without the prohibitive cost of
fine-tuning. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are
text-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector
database. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable
trade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global
context; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with
recall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and
relational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no
semantic understanding. We argue that these heterogeneous retrieval paradigms
are complementary, and propose a principled fusion scheme to orchestrate them
synergistically, mitigating the weaknesses of any single modality. In this work
we introduce HetaRAG, a hybrid, deep-retrieval augmented generation framework
that orchestrates cross-modal evidence from heterogeneous data stores. We plan
to design a system that unifies vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text
engines, and structured databases into a single retrieval plane, dynamically
routing and fusing evidence to maximize recall, precision, and contextual
fidelity. To achieve this design goal, we carried out preliminary explorations
and constructed an initial RAG pipeline; this technical report provides a brief
overview. The partial code is available at
https://github.com/KnowledgeXLab/HetaRAG.

*Dayu Yang,Hui Fang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReGeS是一个检索-生成协同框架，通过生成增强检索来提炼用户意图，检索增强生成来区分物品特征，在对话推荐系统中实现了最先进的推荐准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统要么需要领域特定工程而缺乏灵活性，要么依赖大语言模型但存在幻觉风险。RAG在CRS中应用受限于嘈杂对话和相似物品细微差异。

Method: 提出ReGeS框架，统一生成增强检索（从对话中提炼用户意图）和检索增强生成（区分细微物品特征），无需额外标注，减少幻觉，简化持续更新。

Result: 在多个CRS基准测试中，ReGeS实现了最先进的推荐准确率。

Conclusion: 检索-生成协同对于知识密集型CRS任务非常有效，能够提高推荐准确性同时减少幻觉风险。

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for
conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user
preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific
engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models,
which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that
weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose
ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies
generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from
conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item
features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces
hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS
benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in
recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy
for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了MIXRAG框架，通过多专家图检索器和动态路由控制器解决传统图RAG系统在复杂查询处理中的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的RAG系统依赖单一检索器，难以捕捉复杂查询的多样化方面，且容易受到无关噪声的干扰

Method: 采用混合专家架构，包含多个专门化图检索器（关注实体、关系或子图拓扑等不同方面），通过动态路由控制器自适应选择和融合检索器，并引入查询感知的图编码器来减少噪声

Result: 实证结果显示该方法达到最先进性能，在各种图基任务中持续优于多个基线方法

Conclusion: MIXRAG框架能够有效处理多样化查询意图，在不同领域的图基任务中表现出色

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of applications. However, they often suffer from hallucinations in
knowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining
corpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference.
Among these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich
information that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has
led to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential,
most existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant
subgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex
queries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the
relevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant
noise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a
Mixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized
graph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse
query intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph
semantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A
Mixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers
based on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we
introduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships
within the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while
down-weighting unnecessary noise. Empirical results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms various
baselines. MIXRAG is effective across a wide range of graph-based tasks in
different domains. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: 模型融合技术在特定领域检索任务中具有潜力，能够有效提升检索效果，特别是在数据资源有限的情况下，为领域适应提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the effect of model merging in ad-hoc retrieval
tasks. Model merging is a technique that combines the diverse characteristics
of multiple models. We hypothesized that applying model merging to
domain-specific ad-hoc retrieval tasks could improve retrieval effectiveness.
To verify this hypothesis, we merged the weights of a source retrieval model
and a domain-specific (non-retrieval) model using a linear interpolation
approach. A key advantage of our approach is that it requires no additional
fine-tuning of the models. We conducted two experiments each in the medical and
Japanese domains. The first compared the merged model with the source retrieval
model, and the second compared it with a LoRA fine-tuned model under both full
and limited data settings for model construction. The experimental results
indicate that model merging has the potential to produce more effective
domain-specific retrieval models than the source retrieval model, and may serve
as a practical alternative to LoRA fine-tuning, particularly when only a
limited amount of data is available.

Result: 在公开基准测试和大规模在线A/B测试中，GoalRank始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 生成器单阶段排序框架不仅理论上更优，在实践中也能实现更好的性能，证明了单阶段方法的有效性。

Abstract: Mainstream ranking approaches typically follow a Generator-Evaluator
two-stage paradigm, where a generator produces candidate lists and an evaluator
selects the best one. Recent work has attempted to enhance performance by
expanding the number of candidate lists, for example, through multi-generator
settings. However, ranking involves selecting a recommendation list from a
combinatorially large space. Simply enlarging the candidate set remains
ineffective, and performance gains quickly saturate. At the same time, recent
advances in large recommendation models have shown that end-to-end one-stage
models can achieve promising performance with the expectation of scaling laws.
Motivated by this, we revisit ranking from a generator-only one-stage
perspective. We theoretically prove that, for any (finite
Multi-)Generator-Evaluator model, there always exists a generator-only model
that achieves strictly smaller approximation error to the optimal ranking
policy, while also enjoying scaling laws as its size increases. Building on
this result, we derive an evidence upper bound of the one-stage optimization
objective, from which we find that one can leverage a reward model trained on
real user feedback to construct a reference policy in a group-relative manner.
This reference policy serves as a practical surrogate of the optimal policy,
enabling effective training of a large generator-only ranker. Based on these
insights, we propose GoalRank, a generator-only ranking framework. Extensive
offline experiments on public benchmarks and large-scale online A/B tests
demonstrate that GoalRank consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文从理论和实证角度分析生成式检索(GR)与稠密检索(DR)在学习目标和表示能力上的根本差异，发现GR在规模化时能克服DR的局限性，但在实践中尚未完全超越DR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式检索作为神经信息检索新范式的理论基础，探讨其与稠密检索的根本差异，以及在大规模应用中的潜在优势。

Method: 通过理论分析和在Natural Questions、MS MARCO数据集上的控制实验，比较GR和DR在不同负采样策略、嵌入维度和模型规模下的表现。

Result: 理论分析表明GR在大规模语料库和大型模型下具有优势：避免DR因局部归一化导致的优化漂移，且表示能力随参数规模扩展。但实证显示GR在实践中并未普遍优于DR。

Conclusion: GR具有理论优势但需解决实践差距，为未来可扩展和鲁棒的生成式检索研究提供了方向指导。

Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in neural information
retrieval, offering an alternative to dense retrieval (DR) by directly
generating identifiers of relevant documents. In this paper, we theoretically
and empirically investigate how GR fundamentally diverges from DR in both
learning objectives and representational capacity. GR performs globally
normalized maximum-likelihood optimization and encodes corpus and relevance
information directly in the model parameters, whereas DR adopts locally
normalized objectives and represents the corpus with external embeddings before
computing similarity via a bilinear interaction. Our analysis suggests that,
under scaling, GR can overcome the inherent limitations of DR, yielding two
major benefits. First, with larger corpora, GR avoids the sharp performance
degradation caused by the optimization drift induced by DR's local
normalization. Second, with larger models, GR's representational capacity
scales with parameter size, unconstrained by the global low-rank structure that
limits DR. We validate these theoretical insights through controlled
experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, across varying
negative sampling strategies, embedding dimensions, and model scales. But
despite its theoretical advantages, GR does not universally outperform DR in
practice. We outline directions to bridge the gap between GR's theoretical
potential and practical performance, providing guidance for future research in

Abstract: Multi-turn RAG systems often face queries with colloquial omissions and
ambiguous references, posing significant challenges for effective retrieval and
generation. Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify
queries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of
understanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in
real-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system
response. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this
gap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared
to human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models
trained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?
In this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting
model to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user
intent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,
current queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality
rewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue
history and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the
rewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost
end-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that
SynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and
generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that synthetic rewrites can serve as
a scalable and effective alternative to human annotations.

TL;DR: BiasRAG是一个针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的公平性漏洞攻击框架，通过两阶段后门攻击操纵目标群体与社会偏见之间的语义关系，实现持久且隐蔽的内容生成影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RAG系统的虚假信息威胁，而公平性漏洞尚未得到充分探索。传统后门攻击依赖直接触发到目标的映射，但公平性驱动的攻击利用检索与生成模型之间的交互，更具隐蔽性。

Method: 采用两阶段后门攻击：预训练阶段破坏查询编码器，使目标群体与特定社会偏见对齐；部署后阶段向知识库注入对抗性文档，强化后门影响，同时保持标准公平性评估下的不可检测性。

Result: 实证评估显示BiasRAG实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了上下文相关性和实用性，对RAG系统的公平性构成持久且不断演变的威胁。

Conclusion: BiasRAG揭示了RAG系统中存在的严重公平性漏洞，这种攻击具有精确目标对齐、隐蔽执行和强韧性等特点，需要开发新的防御机制来应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding by
integrating retrieval mechanisms with generative models but introduces new
attack surfaces, particularly through backdoor attacks. While prior research
has largely focused on disinformation threats, fairness vulnerabilities remain
underexplored. Unlike conventional backdoors that rely on direct
trigger-to-target mappings, fairness-driven attacks exploit the interaction
between retrieval and generation models, manipulating semantic relationships
between target groups and social biases to establish a persistent and covert
influence on content generation.
  This paper introduces BiasRAG, a systematic framework that exposes fairness
vulnerabilities in RAG through a two-phase backdoor attack. During the
pre-training phase, the query encoder is compromised to align the target group
with the intended social bias, ensuring long-term persistence. In the
post-deployment phase, adversarial documents are injected into knowledge bases
to reinforce the backdoor, subtly influencing retrieved content while remaining
undetectable under standard fairness evaluations. Together, BiasRAG ensures
precise target alignment over sensitive attributes, stealthy execution, and
resilience. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that BiasRAG achieves high attack
success rates while preserving contextual relevance and utility, establishing a
persistent and evolving threat to fairness in RAG.
