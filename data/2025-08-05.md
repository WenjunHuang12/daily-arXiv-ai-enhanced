### [1] [Graph-based Interaction Augmentation Network for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01168)
*Hu Zhangfeng,Shi mengxin*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图的框架，利用模态内和模态间交互来恢复缺失语义，提升多模态情感分析的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中多模态数据的不完美性对情感分析提出挑战，现有方法未能充分利用模态间的复杂依赖关系。

Method: 设计可学习超图建模模态内时序依赖，使用有向图探索模态间相关性，并整合完美样本知识监督交互过程。

Result: 在MOSI和MOSEI数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模态内和模态间交互，显著提升了不完美样本的情感分析性能。

Abstract: The inevitable modality imperfection in real-world scenarios poses
significant challenges for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). While existing
methods tailor reconstruction or joint representation learning strategies to
restore missing semantics, they often overlook complex dependencies within and
across modalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available
modalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes
a novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality
interactions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from
complementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable
hypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual
information within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore
inter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing
complementary information across different modalities. Finally, the knowledge
from perfect samples is integrated to supervise our interaction processes,
guiding the model toward learning reliable and robust joint representations.
Extensive experiments on MOSI and MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

### [2] [DRKF: Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion for Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01644)
*Peiyuan Jiang,Yao Liu,Qiao Liu,Zongshun Zhang,Jiaye Yang,Lu Liu,Daibing Yao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DRKF的多模态情感识别方法，通过解耦表示和知识融合解决模态异质性和情感不一致问题，实验表明其在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别中模态异质性和情感线索不一致是主要挑战，需要一种方法来有效整合多模态信息并处理不一致性。

Method: DRKF包含优化表示学习模块（ORL）和知识融合模块（KF）。ORL通过对比互信息估计解耦共享表示和模态特定特征，KF通过自注意力融合编码器整合情感信息，并引入情感判别子模块（ED）处理不一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP、MELD和M3ED数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: DRKF通过解耦表示和知识融合有效解决了多模态情感识别中的异质性和不一致性问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by
integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However,
inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain
key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a
Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF
consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module
and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual
information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to
decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features
while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight
self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality
and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused
representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality
selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion
Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to
retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even
if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion
Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging
preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.

### [3] [PCS Workflow for Veridical Data Science in the Age of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00835)
*Zachary T. Rewolinski,Bin Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PCS框架的更新版本，旨在解决数据科学生命周期中的不确定性，并通过案例研究展示了数据清理阶段对预测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学在AI中至关重要，但其结果难以复现，主要原因是数据科学生命周期中的选择不确定性。传统统计框架无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 提出更新的PCS框架，结合生成式AI的指导，并通过案例研究展示其在数据清理阶段的应用。

Result: PCS框架为数据科学生命周期中的不确定性提供了原则性解决方案，并通过案例研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: PCS框架为数据科学实践提供了可验证的解决方案，有助于减少不确定性并提高结果的可复现性。

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

### [4] [A Residual Guided strategy with Generative Adversarial Networks in training Physics-Informed Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00855)
*Ziyang Zhang,Feifan Zhang,Weidong Tang,Lei Shi,Tailai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN的残差引导训练策略，通过Transformer和GAN结合解决PINNs在时空区域中的残差问题和时间因果性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在复杂物理系统建模中存在未解决的残差和时间因果性违反问题。

Method: 结合解码器Transformer和残差感知GAN，引入因果惩罚项和自适应采样机制。

Result: 在多个方程上测试，相对MSE降低高达三个数量级。

Conclusion: 为多尺度和时间依赖PDE系统提供了深度学习与物理建模的桥梁。

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结构化方法，将地理空间基础模型整合到实际应用中，通过案例研究展示了其性能提升和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理空间基础模型在遥感应用中有潜力，但实际部署面临数据异质性、资源限制等挑战。

Method: 提出三步协议：定义应用需求、适应领域数据、严格实证测试，并以Presto模型为例进行作物制图。

Result: 微调预训练模型显著优于传统监督方法，展示了强大的时空泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该协议为实践者提供了可复制的蓝图，并为未来研究奠定了基础，展示了框架的可扩展性。

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何高效处理多维编码和线性空间的结构信息，并揭示其与生物神经结构的潜在相似性。

Method: 采用稀疏位向量和固定长度线性向量，提出离散随机降维和几何离散嵌入方法。

Result: 通过三种模态验证了方法的有效性，并发现与哺乳动物新皮质的“风车”结构有相似性。

Conclusion: 模型中的结构可能与新皮质的组织过程存在相似性，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: The article explores an encoding and structural information processing
approach using sparse bit vectors and fixed-length linear vectors. The
following are presented: a discrete method of speculative stochastic
dimensionality reduction of multidimensional code and linear spaces with linear
asymptotic complexity; a geometric method for obtaining discrete embeddings of
an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given
modality. The structure and properties of a code space are investigated using
three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and
immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of
the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian
neocortex. A cautious assumption is made about similarities between neocortex
organisation and processes happening in our models.

### [7] [A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Axial Load Capacity in Steel Storage Rack Columns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00876)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于预测冷弯型钢构件的轴向承载能力，通过梯度提升回归和SHAP解释模型，提高了预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分析方法难以捕捉冷弯型钢构件在屈曲行为中的非线性和几何复杂性，因此需要一种更准确且可解释的预测方法。

Method: 使用多种回归算法（包括线性模型、核回归和集成树方法）进行模型选择，最终选择梯度提升回归作为最优模型，并通过SHAP方法解释特征重要性。

Result: 梯度提升回归在R2、RMSE和MAE等指标上表现最佳，模型通过Streamlit集成到交互式Web界面中，便于实际应用。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了数据驱动工具在提高设计安全性、简化验证流程和指导结构决策方面的潜力，特别是在屈曲为关键失效模式的应用中。

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

### [8] [Satellite Connectivity Prediction for Fast-Moving Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00877)
*Chao Yan,Babak Mafakheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了利用机器学习预测卫星信号质量，以提升移动物体（如飞机）的卫星连接可靠性，测试F1分数达0.97。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对无缝互联网访问需求的增长，特别是在交通和偏远地区，卫星连接对快速移动物体至关重要。机器学习可预测信号质量，优化网络切换。

Method: 分析GEO卫星与飞机通信的真实数据集，利用机器学习预测信号质量。

Result: 预测模型在测试数据上F1分数为0.97，验证了机器学习在信号质量预测中的准确性。

Conclusion: 该模型可提升卫星通信效率，适用于其他移动物体，如车辆和火车，支持实时信号质量预测和自动化切换。

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

*Moutaz Bellah Bentrad,Adel Ghoggal,Tahar Bahi,Abderaouf Bahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的无模型方法，用于感应电机的故障诊断，避免了传统模型方法的复杂性和高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的诊断方法复杂且计算成本高，需要开发动态模型，难以实现。

Method: 使用GNN直接从原始电流和振动信号中学习特征，无需信号预处理或手动特征提取，提出GNN-ASE模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在偏心缺陷、轴承故障和断条检测中的准确率分别为92.5%、91.2%和93.1%。

Conclusion: GNN框架提供了一种轻量级且强大的解决方案，简化实现并保持高诊断性能，是传统方法的有效替代。

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了机器学习在建筑能源系统中应用的透明度和可重复性标准，发现大多数研究因关键信息缺失而不可重复，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨机器学习研究中普遍存在的可重复性问题，特别是在应用领域（如建筑能源系统）中的表现。

Method: 通过分析相关文献，评估其数据、代码和方法披露的完整性。

Result: 72%的文章未说明数据来源，仅两篇提供代码链接（其中一篇失效），学术与行业作者的可重复性无显著差异。

Conclusion: 需制定指南、培训和政策以提高透明度和可重复性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前自然语言处理领域对幻觉有明确定义和方法，但MVTS基础模型缺乏类似定义和方法，阻碍其安全应用。

Method: 提出MVTS幻觉的新定义，使用扩散模型检测和缓解幻觉，并通过关系数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示开源预训练MVTS填补模型平均幻觉水平高达59.5%，缓解方法可降低47.7%。

Conclusion: 提出的定义和方法有助于提升MVTS基础模型的安全性和采用率。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRINN是一种新的近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）算法范式，通过强化学习优化执行速度，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS算法在AI应用中日益重要，尤其是在检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的LLM应用中。现有方法需要大量专业知识和手动优化，CRINN旨在通过强化学习自动化这一过程。

Method: CRINN将ANNS优化视为强化学习问题，以执行速度作为奖励信号，自动生成更快且满足精度约束的ANNS实现。

Result: 在六个广泛使用的NNS基准数据集上，CRINN在三个数据集上表现最佳，两个数据集上并列第一。

Conclusion: CRINN的成功不仅验证了强化学习在ANNS优化中的有效性，还展示了LLM结合强化学习可以自动化复杂算法优化的潜力。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效挖掘全局时空关系并平衡局部与全局模式，提升交通流量预测性能。

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的通用最短路径搜索框架，通过构建骨架图和SGNN学习节点嵌入，结合LSearch和HLSearch算法，在多种图上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法（如Dijkstra和A*）在复杂图上效率低，而基于索引的方法需要大量预处理和存储。现有学习方法的通用性受限，需依赖特定领域特征。

Method: 构建骨架图捕捉多级距离和跳数信息，使用SGNN学习节点嵌入并预测距离和跳数，结合LSearch和HLSearch算法进行高效搜索。

Result: 在五种真实图上实验表明，该框架性能优越，适用于多种图类型。

Conclusion: 该框架为基于学习的最短路径搜索提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Abstract: The optimal control problem of stochastic systems is commonly solved via
robust or scenario-based optimization methods, which are both challenging to
scale to long optimization horizons. We cast the optimal control problem of a
stochastic system as a convex optimization problem over occupation measures. We

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了传统松弛方法的误差问题，显著提升了图匹配问题的求解性能。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种动态个性化框架，用于识别风险驾驶行为，利用滚动时间窗口和双层优化动态调整风险阈值和模型超参数。DNN在高召回任务中表现优异，XGBoost表现平衡稳定，随机森林对动态调整敏感。速度加权车距比激烈驾驶事件更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架依赖固定时间窗口和静态阈值，无法适应驾驶行为的随机性，因此需要动态个性化方法。

Method: 使用比利时自然驾驶数据，采用滚动时间窗口和双层优化动态校准风险阈值和模型超参数，评估三种模型（随机森林、XGBoost、DNN）和两种安全指标（速度加权车距、激烈驾驶事件）。

Result: DNN在高召回任务中表现优异，XGBoost表现平衡稳定，随机森林对动态调整敏感。速度加权车距比激烈驾驶事件更稳定。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化风险检测方法对实时安全反馈和智能交通系统中的驾驶员支持具有重要价值。

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Result: 实验表明潜在边距分布与检测器对后处理图像的泛化能力强相关。

Conclusion: 通过优化潜在边距选择模型可显著提升检测器对后处理图像的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在数据、计算资源和能耗方面的高需求限制了其实际部署，因此需要探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 设计了一个由用户、中央任务处理器和主题专用LLM集群组成的网络化系统，通过优化路由和聚合策略来平衡信息准确性和响应速度。

Result: 模拟实验表明，聚合后的响应比单个LLM的准确率更高，尤其是在参与LLM性能相近时效果更显著。

Conclusion: 网络化LLM系统是一种可行的替代方案，能够有效提升响应质量并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论工作主要关注单层、仅注意力架构，而实际研究表明MLP在知识存储中起主要作用。本文旨在解决简化模型无法有效获取或提取知识的问题。

Method: 引入结合自注意力和MLP的单层Transformer框架，通过梯度动态分析其收敛性和泛化能力。

Result: 证明了Transformer在预训练中能有效获取知识，在特定条件下能成功提取知识，否则会出现幻觉。实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer的知识获取和提取提供了理论支持，并解释了相关现象如学习率调度的作用。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained

activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD在泛化性和性能上优于现有方法，适用于多样化问题。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

Motivation: 商业LLM服务隐藏内部推理痕迹但仍对生成的令牌收费，导致令牌通胀和超额计费风险，亟需可靠的令牌审计方法。

Method: 提出PALACE框架，通过GRPO增强的适应模块和轻量级领域路由器，从提示-答案对估计隐藏的推理令牌数量。

Result: 在数学、编程、医学和通用推理基准测试中，PALACE实现了低相对误差和高预测准确性。

Conclusion: PALACE为标准化预测审计迈出重要一步，提升了透明度、问责制和用户信任。

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-10、ImageNet等）上，CaliMatch表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CaliMatch通过校准技术显著提升了半监督学习的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态、自动、系统的红队测试框架（DAS），用于持续检测大型语言模型（LLMs）在临床实践中的安全性问题，揭示了现有模型在稳健性、隐私、偏见/公平性和幻觉方面的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs发展迅速，静态安全基准测试往往过时，无法全面评估模型的可信度，因此需要一种动态方法来实时发现潜在风险。

Method: 采用DAS红队测试框架，通过对抗性代理自动生成和演化测试用例，实时评估LLMs在四个关键领域（稳健性、隐私、偏见/公平性、幻觉）的表现。

Result: 测试15个LLMs发现，尽管静态基准测试表现良好（如MedQA准确率超80%），但在动态测试中94%的正确答案失败，隐私泄露率86%，偏见影响81%，幻觉率超66%。

Conclusion: DAS框架为医疗AI提供了动态、可扩展的安全保障，适用于医院、监管机构和技术供应商，以应对LLMs在临床实践中的潜在风险。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

Conclusion: HHN能有效建模时序多模态数据，提升复杂分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自适应版本的LOCO方法（Hi-Fi），用于量化特征重要性中的协同和冗余效应，并通过三个分数（唯一、冗余和协同）描述每个特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征重要性方法仅通过单一分数衡量特征相关性，无法捕捉高阶效应。本文旨在通过Hi-Fi框架更全面地分析特征间的高阶关系。

Method: 提出Hi-Fi框架，为每个特征分配三个分数（唯一、冗余和协同），并与Shapley效应进行比较。

Result: 研究发现O3和NO2与阿尔茨海默病死亡率之间存在协同效应，城市绿地密度也与污染物协同影响死亡率。

Conclusion: Hi-Fi框架为XAI和复杂系统的高阶关系分析提供了新视角，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合海洋知识图谱和大语言模型（OKG-LLM）的新框架，用于全球海表温度（SST）预测，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法未充分利用海洋领域知识，限制了SST预测的进一步提升。

Method: 构建海洋知识图谱（OKG），通过图嵌入网络学习其语义和结构知识，并与数值SST数据及预训练LLM融合。

Result: 实验表明OKG-LLM优于现有方法，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OKG-LLM为SST预测提供了新思路，展示了领域知识与数据驱动结合的潜力。

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

Motivation: 在机器学习中，特征选择是提高模型效率和准确性的关键步骤。现有方法在特征减少和计算效率方面仍有改进空间。

Method: FeatureCuts结合过滤排名和自适应特征截断点选择，优化特征子集。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FeatureCuts平均减少15%的特征和99.6%的计算时间，同时保持模型性能。与PSO结合时，进一步减少25%的特征和66%的计算时间。

Conclusion: FeatureCuts是一种高效、可扩展的特征选择方法，适用于企业级大规模数据集。

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

Method: DLDA利用条件潜在扩散过程在协作嵌入空间中生成虚假用户，并通过分散正则化机制提高行为模式的真实性和多样性。

Result: 在三个真实数据集和五种流行推荐模型上的实验表明，DLDA比现有攻击方法更能提升目标物品排名且更难被检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现代推荐系统比以往认知更脆弱，亟需更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统谱嵌入方法在表达潜在结构特征方面存在局限性，无法充分捕捉变换域中的信息。

Method: 利用图分数傅里叶变换扩展GEFFE方法，引入分数域滤波和非线性特征组合，并通过搜索优化和ResNet18自适应学习动态确定分数阶。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，GEFRFE能捕获更丰富的结构特征并显著提升分类性能，同时保持与GEFFE相当的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: GEFRFE通过分数域扩展提升了嵌入的信息表达能力，是一种高效且性能优越的图表示学习方法。

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia上分别达到91%和84%的准确率，引入新类别后性能稳定。

Conclusion: 提示驱动的语义推理在有限监督下能有效实现细粒度分类。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Result: 改进后的PGNNIV框架成功识别了本构状态方程，提高了预测精度、噪声鲁棒性，并减少了计算需求。

Conclusion: 提出的技术可根据数据和资源需求灵活调整，有效解决了PGNNIV框架的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

Conclusion: FinKario和FinKario-RAG有效解决了金融知识更新和检索问题，提升了LLMs的金融分析能力。

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

Motivation: 探讨多模态融合对模型性能的影响，验证模态互补性的重要性。

Method: 设计并评估五种深度学习模型（三种单模态、两种多模态），通过ECG分类实验验证。

Result: Hybrid 1（时间+时频域）表现最佳，而Hybrid 2（加入频域）无额外提升，甚至略有下降。

Conclusion: 多模态设计的核心在于模态间的互补性而非数量，提出了量化互补性的理论框架。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

Conclusion: VAULT能自动化生成高质量对抗数据，显著提升NLI任务的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI
inference tasks.

Conclusion: MORPHEUS是一个有前景的多模态基础模型框架，适用于肿瘤学研究。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

Motivation: 随着LLM工具的广泛应用，现有推理系统在请求路由和调度方面效率不足，需要新的策略来优化性能。

Method: 提出了理论框架，设计了RAD调度器以实现吞吐量最优，并开发了SLAI调度器以满足实际服务级别目标（SLO）。

Result: 在Mistral-7B模型上的实验表明，SLAI将TTFT中位数降低了53%，服务容量提升了26%，同时满足尾部TBT延迟约束。

Conclusion: SLAI调度器在提升LLM推理系统性能方面表现出色，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic

depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Result: 实验表明，MA-PROPS能更高效地减少联合采样误差，并提高独立策略梯度算法的收敛可靠性。

Conclusion: MA-PROPS通过减少联合采样误差，显著提升了多智能体强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

Motivation: 现有数据集多关注分子级别属性预测，忽略了功能组信息，而功能组数据能提供分子结构与文本描述间的联系，有助于构建更可解释的LLMs。

Method: 构建FGBench数据集，包含625K分子属性推理问题，精确标注功能组，涵盖回归和分类任务，评估LLMs在功能组级别推理的能力。

Result: 当前LLMs在功能组级别推理表现不佳，凸显了提升LLMs化学任务推理能力的必要性。

Conclusion: FGBench为构建功能组级别数据集提供了框架，有助于LLMs理解分子结构与属性的细粒度关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis

Result: 在多个复杂动态系统（如高维WeatherBench数据集）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为概率预测和动态系统状态扰动提供了新的解决方案，适用于高维复杂系统。

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

Method: 使用树结构（BUS）分层分割用户，基于NDCG目标函数优化行为代表性，结合社交图减少偏见，生成连接感知的推荐。

Result: 离线分析显示BUS显著优于传统方法，线上部署后产品指标（如音乐排名和邮件通知）显著提升。

Conclusion: BUS是首个在大规模工业应用中有效整合用户属性并保持语义可解释性的列表式学习排序框架。

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

Result: 生成的随机数通过了大部分NIST测试，热图显示明显的统计随机性，且在预测攻击中表现良好。

Conclusion: Transformer-based PRNGs能够有效生成高质量随机数，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身模仿学习的主要挑战在于平衡灾难性遗忘和新技能获取，现有方法通常孤立处理这些问题，忽视了它们的内在关联。

Method: T2S通过标记化模型参数，将传统Transformer的线性参数映射转化为输入与可学习标记之间的跨注意力机制，并通过语言引导的技能扩展实现高效知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，T2S在防止灾难性遗忘（NBT平均1.0%）、新技能扩展（仅需8.0%可训练标记）和任务间知识迁移（FWT平均77.7%）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: T2S为终身模仿学习提供了一个有效的解决方案，兼具可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

TL;DR: MARS是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过风险感知和动态调整投资组合来平衡风险与回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习模型在动态市场条件下难以平衡风险与回报，MARS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MARS采用异构智能体集合，每个智能体有独特的风险偏好，并通过Meta-Adaptive Controller动态调整组合。

Result: 实验显示MARS显著降低最大回撤和波动性，同时保持竞争力回报。

Conclusion: MARS通过行为多样性而非市场特征工程，实现了风险与回报的优越平衡。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的后训练优化目标是风险中性的，而评估却依赖风险寻求指标（如Pass@k和Max@k），导致性能不佳。

Method: RSPO通过利用闭式概率计算每个响应在k次采样中为最大值的概率，解决了低奖励响应被无意强化的问题，并提供了高效的梯度估计器。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，RSPO能够有效优化Pass@k和Max@k指标。

Conclusion: RSPO填补了训练目标与评估指标之间的差距，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

Motivation: 现代神经网络主要依赖单调递增的激活函数（如ReLU），需要大量参数才能逼近复杂函数。本文旨在通过周期性非单调激活函数PLU，提升网络的表达能力和参数效率。

Method: 提出周期性线性单元（PLU），结合一种称为排斥性重参数化的创新技术，防止激活函数退化为线性函数。

Result: 实验表明，仅含两个PLU神经元的最小MLP即可解决螺旋分类任务，而传统激活函数无法完成。

Conclusion: PLU为神经网络提供了一种新的范式，从分段泰勒式逼近转向傅里叶式函数合成，显著提升了参数效率。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

cutting-edge multimodal LLMs reveal critical limitations of current approaches.
We hope SpectrumLab will serve as a crucial foundation for future advancements
in deep learning-driven spectroscopy.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图中常遇到节点特征缺失的问题，直接使用图神经网络会导致下游任务性能下降。现有方法在特征极少时表现不如传统结构模型。

Method: GOODIE采用混合方法，结合标签传播和特征传播分支，设计了结构-特征注意力机制和伪标签对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，GOODIE在特征缺失和丰富情况下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOODIE通过结合标签传播和特征传播，有效提升了图神经网络在特征缺失场景下的性能。

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code
of GOODIE is available at: https://github.com/SukwonYun/GOODIE.

Conclusion: MOFS为跨科学领域的通用且数据高效的算子学习提供了新基础。

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

Motivation: 传统空间插值方法因传感器覆盖有限且不规则，难以生成可靠结果，因此需要一种更可靠且能传达不确定性的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了时空数据的可视化可靠性，并通过可视化设计有效传达了不确定性。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦无监督学习中难以实现全局均匀性，主要由于非独立同分布数据和去中心化特性。

Method: 提出SSD方法，通过软分离和蒸馏模块减少客户端模型聚合时的干扰，并引入投影器蒸馏模块优化表征质量。

Result: 在跨设备和跨中心联邦设置中，SSD显著提升了表征质量和任务性能。

Conclusion: SSD有效解决了FUL中的全局均匀性问题，为相关研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

Motivation: 解决元强化学习中探索与利用的平衡问题，探索是否可以通过贪婪目标自然涌现。

Method: 提出三个条件（环境结构重复性、代理记忆能力、长时程信用分配），并通过实验验证其必要性。

Result: 在满足前两个条件时，贪婪目标训练的代理表现出探索行为；第三个条件并非总是必要。

Conclusion: 探索行为可以在特定条件下从统一的奖励最大化过程中自然涌现，无需显式分离探索与利用目标。

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Method: 提出FedCD框架，采用参数解耦策略，将模型参数分为本地个性化参数和全局共享参数，通过公平感知聚合更新全局参数。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，FedCD框架和个性化策略优于五种FL方法。

Conclusion: FedCD框架在保护隐私的同时实现了公平且精确的认知诊断，适用于多客户端场景。

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了区域灾害韧性评估，还为全球灾害风险减少提供了新工具，同时为城市研究中的弱监督数据分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

Result: 结果表明，PINN模型能够从稀疏数据中学习物理规律，并准确重建流场，尤其是在高度湍流情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: PINNs在稀疏数据下具有潜力，为工程应用中的流场重建提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the
flow field for a highly turbulent flow.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交叉验证方法（如KFCV）计算量大且数据混洗频繁，而简单随机抽样（SRS）可能导致非代表性数据集。FSV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FSV结合了SRS和KFCV，引入加权因子优化性能。实验使用了三个数据集（10,000、50,000和100,000样本），评估了ME、VE、MSE等指标。

Result: FSV在ME、VE、MSE等指标上优于SRS和KFCV，表现更准确可靠，尤其适用于资源受限和大规模数据集。

Conclusion: FSV为机器学习提供了高效的数据分区解决方案，平衡了计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

Motivation: 在深度强化学习中，由于状态和动作分布的变化，训练策略可能导致性能次优甚至崩溃，因此需要评估优化限制。

Method: 提出了一种新的实用次优性估计器，并通过实验验证其在多种环境和RL算法中的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，生成的最佳经验比学习到的策略性能好2-3倍，表明深度RL方法仅利用了生成经验的一半。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习算法的优化限制显著，未来改进需关注如何更有效地利用生成的经验。

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Conclusion: 为LoRA-based FL的聚合策略提供了理论依据，SP和PS均可行但性能有差异。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法在非奇异相互作用核下具有广泛适用性，库仑相互作用核下需基于另一Gibbs测度近似，并证明了势能近似的一致收敛性。

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

Conclusion: DAM在高阶特征交互中受限，研究为理论与实践的桥梁，可能启发更多数据驱动方法。

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多变量时间序列预测中准确性、可解释性和物理可信性的挑战。

Method: 通过自监督的领域无关概念和基于第一性原理的可微残差约束，结合Transformer的注意力机制。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上，CPformer在多数情况下表现最佳，MSE/MAE显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: CPformer通过结合概念透明性和物理约束，显著提升了预测性能，尤其在非周期性数据上表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了深度学习和机器学习模型在预测XRP/USDT交易对收盘价中的应用，强调了市场流动性的重要性，并引入了VVR和VWAP作为流动性代理指标。LSTM模型表现最佳，表明流动性指标对预测准确性至关重要。

Motivation: 加密货币市场快速增长，但价格预测面临挑战，现有模型常忽略市场流动性这一关键因素。

Method: 开发了四种机器学习模型（线性回归、随机森林、XGBoost和LSTM），分别在不包含和包含流动性代理指标（VVR和VWAP）的情况下进行训练和评估。

Result: LSTM模型在两种情况下均表现最佳，流动性指标的加入显著提升了预测准确性。

Conclusion: 市场流动性对加密货币价格预测至关重要，建议在模型中纳入流动性指标以提高预测精度。

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

Result: 实验表明，UniExtreme在极端和一般天气预测中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UniExtreme展示了在多样化极端场景中的卓越适应性和预测性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Result: 在32个基准数据集上验证，该方法优于现有数据增强方法。

Conclusion: 数据驱动的方法能更准确地识别和处理回归任务中的不平衡问题。

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 该方法使AI辅助合成规划系统更接近满足高通量筛选的低延迟需求，提升用户体验。

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

Conclusion: 历史标记有效解决了Transformer的局限性，提升了其在序列分类任务中的表现。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet是一种高效、可扩展的分类方法，未来将探索更多混沌映射以提升性能。

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

Result: 发现冷却形状的平衡探索与利用能提升性能，同时调整AdamW超参数（如β2）也有显著影响。

Conclusion: 优化冷却阶段配置对Transformer训练至关重要，需与传统超参数调优结合。

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

Result: 实验表明InstructTime在编辑质量和可控性上表现优异，并能泛化到新指令。

Conclusion: InstructTime为时间序列编辑提供了灵活且可控的新方法。

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

TL;DR: FlashSVD是一种针对SVD压缩大语言模型的端到端框架，通过优化激活内存管理，显著减少峰值内存使用，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法虽能减少模型参数，但忽略了推理时的激活内存开销，限制了实际部署的可行性。

Method: FlashSVD通过融合低秩投影核到自注意力和前馈网络管道，避免生成完整激活缓冲区，动态计算并释放内存。

Result: 在BERT-Base等基准测试中，FlashSVD将峰值激活内存减少70.2%，中间临时内存减少75%，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: FlashSVD为内存受限的低秩大语言模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

Result: 在真实和合成数据上均表现优异，尤其在长期预测中，且能准确恢复真实频率。

Conclusion: 将频谱先验注入深度时序模型可提升长期预测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware

SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

Method: 分析刚性数值积分方案的稳定性函数，推导参数敏感性的衰减规律，并提供常见方案的显式公式。

Result: 证明所有A稳定时间步进方法在刚性区域都会抑制参数梯度，衰减速率最慢为$O(|z|^{-1})$。

Conclusion: 刚性神经ODE的训练和参数识别面临根本性限制，梯度消失现象是普遍且不可避免的。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 原型神经网络通过比较输入与训练数据中的代表性信号模式提供可解释的预测。研究表明，这些原型在外部临床数据库中与医院出院诊断（phecode）显著相关，且比分类器预测或NLP提取的概念更具特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨原型神经网络的原型是否能够捕捉与临床表型相关的潜在结构，而不仅仅是分类任务。

Method: 使用基于原型的深度学习模型在PTB-XL数据集上进行多标签ECG分类训练，然后在MIMIC-IV临床数据库上进行推理，评估原型与phecode的关联。

Result: 原型与临床结果显著相关，且在非心脏疾病（如败血症和肾病）中也表现出预测性能（AUC 0.89-0.91）。

Conclusion: 原型模型能够从生理时间序列数据中提供可解释的数字表型，捕捉超出原始训练目标的临床相关生理特征。

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率和图神经网络的ESPP求解方法，通过无监督学习优化路径选择，实验证明其优于传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ESPP中负权环导致的NP难问题，寻求一种高效且通用的近优解方法。

Method: 使用无监督图神经网络联合学习节点值估计和边选择概率，通过替代损失函数优化路径选择。

Result: 在100节点以内的图上表现优于无监督基线和经典启发式方法，具有跨规模和跨拓扑的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为ESPP提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多层感知机（MLP）的方法忽视了时间序列建模中的层次局部性和序列归纳偏置，性能提升有限。KAN因其自适应基函数能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 引入KANMixer架构，结合多尺度混合主干，充分利用KAN的自适应能力。

Result: 在7个基准数据集的28个实验中，KANMixer在16个实验中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: KAN的自适应基函数显著改变了网络结构先验对预测性能的影响，为LTSF中有效利用KAN提供了实证指导。

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

Result: 实验表明DC-PFL显著减少训练时间并提高模型准确性。

Conclusion: DC-PFL有效应对数据异构性，优化联邦学习的效率和性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法弥合了自动化设计与专家判断之间的差距，提供了可信赖的生成设计解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

Motivation: 研究去噪分数匹配损失中启发式加权函数的理论基础，填补其缺乏形式化证明的空白。

Method: 通过理论分析揭示异方差性，推导广义任意阶去噪分数匹配损失的最优加权函数，并与启发式加权进行对比。

Result: 发现启发式加权是期望最优加权的一阶泰勒近似，且在参数梯度上可能方差更低，训练更稳定高效。

Conclusion: 启发式加权虽简单，但在实际应用中可能优于理论最优加权，为扩散模型提供了更高效稳定的训练方法。

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

Motivation: 现实场景中多数据流的异质性和概念漂移问题限制了现有方法的通用性，需要动态适应和高效知识迁移的解决方案。

Method: CAMEL框架为每个数据流分配独立系统和任务特定头，动态专家池捕获流特定模式，协作专家通过注意力机制整合跨流知识，AET策略动态管理专家生命周期。

Conclusion: CAMEL通过动态协作和专家级可塑性，为多数据流学习提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Method: 基于开源GRPO框架开发EPRLI算法，结合难度感知干预解决数学问题。

Result: 在1.5B参数模型上，AIME24达50.0%，Math500达89.2%，AMC达77.1%，Minerva达35.3%，OBench达51.9%，超越O1-Preview，接近O1-mini。

Conclusion: EPRLI算法在标准实验室环境下表现优异，为复现先进推理LLM提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large

draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series,
DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 series, and Grok 3 series, remain undisclosed, making it

Motivation: 解决强化学习中因低质量数据或错误动作导致的决策问题，通过外部代理的监督和反馈提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，结合人类反馈显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和准确性，尤其在复杂或模糊环境中。

Conclusion: ARL框架通过结合机器效率和人类洞察力，为数据驱动应用提供了一种可扩展的性能提升方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Motivation: 大规模高质量电子健康记录（EHR）的稀缺性限制了生物医学研究，尤其是在传统中医（TCM）领域。现有方法难以处理多模态数据的复杂性和数据缺失问题。

Method: 提出TCDiff框架，包含三阶段扩散网络：参考模态扩散、跨模态桥接和目标模态扩散，用于生成高质量EHR数据。

Result: 实验表明，TCDiff在数据保真度上平均优于现有基线10%，同时保持隐私性。

Conclusion: TCDiff在真实医疗场景中表现出高效性、鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中表现优于现有无保留数据遗忘方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单有效的无保留数据遗忘方法，显著提升了遗忘效果并保持模型实用性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Conclusion: EAC-MoE有效解决了MoE-LLMs的关键挑战，为高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

Motivation: 微服务架构的分布式特性带来了性能监控和资源管理的挑战，现有方法无法有效处理异构数据或整合互补模态。

Method: USRFNet使用GNN捕捉服务交互和请求传播模式，同时用gMLP模块独立建模集群资源动态，最后融合为统一系统嵌入以预测P95延迟。

Result: 在真实微服务基准测试中，USRFNet在大规模压力测试条件下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: USRFNet通过分离和整合流量与资源特征，为微服务性能监控提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了MPC的计算和通信开销，同时保持了隐私性，为隐私敏感领域的模型推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

*Minsuk Jang,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPARTA框架利用尖峰时序信息提升SNN的效率和准确性，将注意力复杂度从O(N^2)降至O(K^2)，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SNN主要依赖速率编码，忽视了尖峰时序信息中的丰富计算线索，导致未能充分利用时间动态特性。

Method: 提出SPARTA框架，通过竞争门控和尖峰时序信息（如发放模式、尖峰时间、尖峰间隔）实现高效稀疏注意力。

Result: 在DVS-Gesture上达到98.78%的准确率，CIFAR10-DVS和CIFAR-10上分别为83.06%和95.3%，且稀疏度达65.4%。

Conclusion: 利用尖峰时序动态特性可显著提升计算效率和准确性，SPARTA为SNN提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency
and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型异构的联邦学习框架，通过交换特征分布而非模型参数，提升客户端的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中数据异构导致的泛化性能低问题，特别是在客户端模型架构不同的场景下。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在泛化准确性、通信成本和内存消耗上优于现有模型异构联邦学习框架。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了模型异构联邦学习的性能，同时降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习存在通信开销、系统异构性和滞后效应问题，AFL通过异步更新解决了这些问题，但需要进一步适应非凸和异构场景。

Method: 提出了一种基于新鲜度的聚合方法和动态学习率调度，分析了客户端选择策略对收敛的影响，并在PyTorch中实现。

Result: 实验验证了方法在异步、异构和非凸场景下的性能和可扩展性提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的异步联邦学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展核化赌博机（KB）和广义线性赌博机（GLB）的模型，研究在更广泛设置下的遗憾最小化问题。

Method: 提出GKB-UCB算法，并设计了一种新的自归一化Bernstein-like不等式用于分析遗憾。

Result: 遗憾界为$\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$，与KB和GLB的最优结果一致。

Conclusion: GKB-UCB算法在广义核化赌博机中实现了与现有最优算法相当的遗憾界，统一了KB和GLB的视角。

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为结构化数据训练基础模型提供了可行且通用的途径。

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

TL;DR: PHAR是一个将时间序列分类模型的特征归因转化为结构化、可读性强的规则框架，提升模型透明度和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类模型的解释性差，难以理解原始时间序列和高维输入空间。

Method: PHAR将后验解释器（如LIME、SHAP）的数值特征归因转化为规则，并通过规则融合步骤优化覆盖、置信度和简洁性。

Result: PHAR在UCI数据集上表现优异，提升了时间序列分类任务的解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: PHAR通过规则化和可视化技术，解决了时间序列分类模型的解释性问题，增强了透明度和一致性。

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as
fitness tracking, smart homes, and healthcare monitoring. Traditional HAR
systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and
robust HAR systems.

Motivation: 解决随机最优控制问题，扩展确定性PINN方法到随机场景，提供理论支持。

Method: 在每次迭代中，通过最小化固定策略诱导的线性PDE残差，训练神经网络近似值函数。

Result: 在多个基准问题上验证了方法的有效性，包括随机倒立摆、钟摆问题和高维LQR问题。

Conclusion: PINN-PI框架在随机最优控制问题中表现出色，继承了经典策略迭代的全局指数收敛性。

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的生成质量，同时采样速度提升了300x-2000x。

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR在生成质量和效率上均优于现有方法，适用于高分辨率数据的连续条件生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Method: 提出OccamVTS框架，通过金字塔式特征对齐及相关性和特征蒸馏，从LVMs中提取关键1%的预测信息。

Result: 实验表明，OccamVTS在多个基准数据集上达到最优性能，参数仅需1%，且在少样本和零样本场景表现突出。

Conclusion: OccamVTS通过极简参数设计，有效避免过拟合，同时保留关键时序模式，为时间序列预测提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 交互式大语言模型（LLM）的快速增长对云GPU的低延迟需求激增，导致高能耗。传统静态或基于规则的功耗管理策略难以在不影响性能的情况下实现节能。

Method: 提出AGFT框架，利用在线强化学习实时监控请求负载和延迟，通过细粒度频率控制和智能动作空间剪枝实现高效决策。

Result: 实验显示AGFT节省44.3%的GPU能耗，性能延迟仅增加不到10%，综合能效优化达40.3%。

Conclusion: AGFT显著提升了LLM推理集群的能效和经济效益，且不影响服务质量。

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Method: 提出伪线性TO方法，作为全梯度的线性近似，匹配SGD收敛速度且减少方差。还引入两种简化变体以提高计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，TO方法在强凸和非凸场景下均比基准算法（如ADAM）收敛更快，并在LLM微调中表现优异。

Conclusion: 可训练优化框架（尤其是伪线性TO）在性能和效率上优于传统方法，为优化领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference

ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

Conclusion: 自适应策略提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性，但仍存在局限性，未来需进一步研究客户端退出问题。

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

Result: TD2C在合成和真实数据上均表现出色，尤其在非线性和高维场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TD2C为复杂系统中的因果发现提供了鲁棒且可扩展的新工具。

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PCPO的新方法，通过预惩罚机制和边界感知探索改进安全强化学习中的约束优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Lagrangian方法在约束优化中可能导致振荡和超调，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: PCPO结合了预惩罚机制（通过屏障项）和约束感知内在奖励，采用策略迭代优化。

Result: 理论分析表明PCPO具有收敛性，实验显示其稳定性优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PCPO为约束下的策略优化提供了稳健解决方案，对研究和应用有重要意义。

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型通过修改内部表示来控制生成内容（如情感、风格或真实性）的能力，发现线性可操纵性在训练中期阶段出现，且相关概念的可操纵性出现时间不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型内部表示修改对生成内容的控制效果，明确干预条件，填补现有研究中依赖启发式和试错的不足。

Method: 提出统一的干预检测框架（ID），通过隐藏状态和表示分析揭示线性可操纵性在训练中的动态变化，并引入ID指标（如热图、熵趋势、余弦相似度）进行解释。

Result: 概念在隐藏空间中逐渐线性可分，与线性可操纵性的出现强相关；不同模型家族的实验结果验证了发现的普适性。

Conclusion: 线性可操纵性在训练过程中动态出现，ID框架为理解和控制语言模型生成提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在大型语言模型（LLM）持续预训练中，如何通过经验回放和梯度对齐解决数据分布偏移问题，并提出了高效的MER实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据出现时需要从头开始，效率低下。持续预训练虽高效，但易导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 研究了经验回放和梯度对齐两种方法，并在Llama架构上进行了大规模多语言实验（1000亿token数据）。

Result: 两种方法均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，梯度对齐首次在LLM预训练中证明有效。MER实现高效且计算开销低。

Conclusion: 少量回放旧数据比增加模型规模更高效，但模型规模扩展比高回放率更计算高效。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

Motivation: 研究神经网络内部表示的组织方式，探索是否可以通过无监督方法发现自然子空间。

Method: 使用邻居距离最小化（NDM）目标，无监督学习非基对齐的子空间。

Result: 定性分析显示子空间可解释性强，定量实验验证了子空间与GPT-2中已知电路的关联，并展示了在2B模型中的扩展性。

Conclusion: NDM为理解模型内部和构建电路提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Conclusion: 该方法能灵活集成不同架构，并显著改善GNN解释的鲁棒性和质量。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Result: 实验显示，DB-RPNI比现有方法快三个数量级，并能推断最小正确自动机。

Conclusion: DBMM和DB-RPNI有效解决了非马尔可夫性问题，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了组合性与特征性复杂度在学习中的差异，为理解二阶方法和扩展梯度适应在少样本学习中的作用提供了方向。

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

Result: 在1000个断路器的合成网络中，OptiGridML将功率输出提升18%，推理时间从小时级降至毫秒级。

Conclusion: 结构化、流量感知的图神经网络在物理网络系统的组合优化中具有加速潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

Result: 在大量合成和真实数据集上表现优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法的不足，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

Motivation: 解决大规模预训练语言模型在多任务微调中参数效率和表达性的平衡问题。

Method: 采用Kronecker乘积分解线性更新，再通过低秩LoRA分解压缩参数，减少计算资源需求。

Result: 在DistilBERT和Mistral-7B上，Kron-LoRA以更少参数匹配或超越标准LoRA性能，支持量化且跨任务迁移表现优异。

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA结合Kronecker结构、低秩压缩和量化友好性，为多任务适配提供高效、可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，该方法实现了1.4倍至9倍的推理计算量减少，且不影响最终性能。

Conclusion: 早期拒绝机制是提升LLMs推理计算效率的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合结构化数据和无结构临床笔记的两阶段框架，用于临床风险预测，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用电子健康记录（EHRs）中的多模态数据（结构化和非结构化）进行准确的临床结果预测，以支持早期干预和资源优化。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：1）使用微调的大型语言模型（LLM）从临床笔记中提取关键信息，并通过图检索外部医学知识增强理解；2）结合非结构化表示和结构化数据特征生成最终预测。

Result: 在30天再入院和院内死亡率预测任务中，AUC分别达到0.84和0.92，优于现有基线方法和临床实践。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合LLM和图检索方法，显著提升了临床预测的准确性，为医疗预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

*Ziyu Zhou,Yiming Huang,Yanyun Wang,Yuankai Wu,James Kwok,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAFNet是一种基于CPA的紧凑架构，用于处理不规则多元时间序列（IMTS），通过预卷积、时间核聚合和频率线性注意力模块，显著提升了预测性能，同时减少了参数和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS建模中广泛使用的CPA方法因零填充导致计算开销大，而现有图模型虽避免CPA但难以捕捉全局相关性。因此，提出保留CPA但优化其处理的KAFNet。

Method: KAFNet结合预卷积模块（平滑序列）、时间核聚合模块（压缩和建模不规则性）和频率线性注意力模块（低成本建模相关性）。

Result: 在多个IMTS数据集上，KAFNet实现了最优预测性能，参数减少7.2倍，训练推理加速8.4倍。

Conclusion: KAFNet证明了CPA在IMTS建模中的价值，并通过高效模块设计显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了方法显著减少模型大小和计算开销，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的剪枝和补偿策略有效构建了高效且高性能的脉冲Transformer模型。

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Conclusion: GRAD通过生成模型和专家混合策略，有效解决了自动竞价中的多样化需求和约束问题，为现代广告系统提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and
10.68% increase in ROI.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶测试中，背景车辆（BVs）的驾驶行为模型对生成安全关键场景至关重要，尤其是其对抗性驾驶特性。

Method: 使用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练双模态驾驶员模型（Dual-DM），并将其连接到连续模拟交通环境中，通过演化场景生成方法生成复杂多样的安全关键场景。

Result: Dual-DM在保持场景保真度和复杂性的同时，显著提高了生成安全关键场景的效率（效率指标提升195%），并展示了场景多样性。

Conclusion: Dual-DM通过演化场景生成方法，显著提升了安全关键场景的生成性能。

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

Method: 分析5,680个编码决策，结合模型自信度和多样性（Shannon熵）预测模型间一致性。

Result: 自信度和多样性组合可解释97.9%的一致性，减少65%人工审核。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可推广的证据标准，用于校准AI在定性研究中的判断。

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

Result: 框架支持多源无数据监督迁移学习，为模型即服务（MaaS）提供商构建高效预训练模型库提供了可能。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了源数据不可用时的迁移学习挑战，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net成功整合物理约束与神经网络，为流行病预测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

Result: 实验表明，AGL 能将安全关键基准的对齐漂移减少高达 50%，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AGL 是 LoRA 的结构化改进，能有效保持对齐性，同时开源实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

Conclusion: 该研究为设计能根据环境难度自动调整学习行为的CTRL算法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results

TL;DR: 该研究利用LSTM神经网络评估大型卡车在工作区合并时的风险，并提出基于风险预测的决策策略，以减少冲突风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型卡车因体积和盲区在工作区合并时易引发事故，需提升其合并安全性。

Method: 采用LSTM神经网络预测合并冲突风险，并与概率风险、50%和85%百分位间隙合并策略对比。

Result: LSTM方法显著降低冲突风险（TET和TIT值更低），支持卡车动态合并而非完全停止。

Conclusion: LSTM方法优于传统策略，能有效提升大型卡车在工作区合并的安全性。

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

TL;DR: PTBCC是一种基于原型学习的贝叶斯分类器组合方法，通过引入原型混淆矩阵解决现有方法在数据稀疏和类别不平衡时的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在数据稀疏或类别不平衡时估计的混淆矩阵不可靠，且单一混淆矩阵难以捕捉标注者的全部专业知识模式。

Method: PTBCC假设存在一组原型混淆矩阵，捕捉所有标注者的专业知识模式，并通过Dirichlet先验分布扩展每个标注者的专业知识。

Result: 在11个真实数据集上的实验表明，PTBCC在最佳情况下准确率提升15%，平均准确率提高3%，同时计算成本降低90%以上。

Conclusion: PTBCC通过原型学习机制有效解决了数据稀疏和类别不平衡问题，提供了更灵活和丰富的标注者专业知识表征。

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

Motivation: 现代深度网络的训练动态仍缺乏深入理解，研究旨在通过结构设计改善收敛性、泛化性和适应性。

Method: 采用包含约束路径和自适应校正的变换层家族，分析其对学习动态的影响，并结合理论和实证研究。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了鲁棒性、优化平滑性和深度可扩展性。

Conclusion: 结构设计不仅是性能调优，更是塑造可扩展且可信赖神经网络学习动态的关键因素。

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

Result: 在多种模型和稀疏比下，加速55%以上线性计算，保持下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 为激活稀疏和算法架构协同设计提供新思路。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

Conclusion: 需整合农场管理策略和气候适应措施，未来研究将采用集成方法提高检测准确性。

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with
climate adaptation practices. Our further investigation will employ ensemble
methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil攻击对联邦学习构成重大威胁，恶意节点可能主导系统，因此需要开发有效的防御措施。

Method: FedLAD将联邦学习的聚合过程建模为线性代数优化问题，通过提取独立线性组合来识别和过滤恶意节点。

Result: 实验表明，FedLAD在恶意节点比例从0.2到0.8时保持低攻击成功率，在0.2到0.5时保持高模型准确性。

Conclusion: FedLAD能显著提升联邦学习系统在数据投毒攻击下的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

Motivation: 大多数人类蛋白质尚未被药物开发，现有虚拟筛选方法缺乏原子级精度且无法预测结合适应性。

Method: AuroBind结合直接偏好优化、自蒸馏和师生加速策略，预测配体结合结构和结合适应性。

Result: AuroBind在结构和功能基准测试中优于现有模型，筛选速度提升100,000倍，实验命中率达7-69%。

Conclusion: AuroBind为结构-功能学习和高通量分子筛选提供了通用框架，填补了结构预测与治疗发现之间的空白。

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

Result: 实验表明，RKD-SC显著减少模型参数，保持高性能，并优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RKD-SC框架为高效、鲁棒的LSM驱动语义通信提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

Motivation: 轨迹预测对用户移动性预判和提前准备至关重要，但轨迹数据的全局和局部时间信息提取复杂，且用户行为时间尺度多样，增加了模式捕捉难度。

Method: 使用MLP提取全局时间信息，MSCNN提取局部时间信息，并通过CA融合两者。MSCNN采用多尺度卷积核以适应不同行为模式。

Result: 在12步预测中，MSE和MAE分别降低了5.04%和4.35%，同时保持相似的推理时间。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了轨迹预测中的时间信息提取问题，显著提升了预测精度。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML框架在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于金融领域的复杂处理优化。

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练模型，高效且可扩展，为提升语言模型的事实可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Result: 在七个连续动作机器人控制任务中，MPFT表现出优于现有方法的超体积性能，同时显著减少交互和硬件需求。

Conclusion: MPFT框架为多目标强化学习提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL为未来智能无线网络提供了一种高效、安全的分布式学习方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising

even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限边缘设备上部署大规模神经网络的问题，通过剪枝减少计算和内存开销。

Method: FAIR-Pruner利用Wasserstein距离量化单元重要性（Utilization Score），通过泰勒展开计算重构误差（Reconstruction Error），并结合容忍差异（Tolerance of Difference）识别冗余单元。

Result: 在多种基准数据集（如ImageNet）和网络架构（如VGG）上，FAIR-Pruner显著压缩模型并保持高精度。

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner是一种高效、自动化的剪枝方法，适用于不同剪枝比例，无需微调即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Result: 基于Transformer的生成器能保留94-97%的真实数据预测性能，并保持特征重要性模式。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可促进航空分析能力，但需对预测准确性保持现实预期。

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

Result: CAPO在多个数学基准和跨域基准上优于监督学习和RL微调方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度信用分配和投票机制，有效提升了强化学习的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Method: 提出DE-SNE算法（DNN-free样本选择）并结合近内存计算技术，构建NMS系统。

Result: NMS在模型准确性上优于现有方法（DQ、DQAS、NeSSA），并显著降低DDR能耗。

Conclusion: NMS是首个DNN-free近内存采样技术，有效解决泛化和能耗问题，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

Method: 提出MicroMix算法，结合MX数据格式和动态量化阈值，选择性分配高精度通道以减少量化误差。

Result: 在多种任务中表现优异，比TensorRT-FP8快20%，并显著降低预填充延迟和内存消耗。

Conclusion: MicroMix在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡，适用于多种LLM模型。

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为分类问题提供了动力学系统和压缩的新视角，而非追求最先进性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

Conclusion: BOOST提供了一种简单有效的方法，显著提升了贝叶斯优化的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

Conclusion: 后验采样对于词嵌入的不确定性量化至关重要，尤其是在小样本情况下。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

Result: 发现注意力汇聚现象是建立参考框架的表现，架构组件（如位置编码）会影响参考框架的具体类型。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer注意力机制提供了新的视角，有助于架构设计优化，并深化了对注意力汇聚现象的理解。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GW和FGW距离在比较异构数据时强大，但计算复杂且非凸，现有切片方法局限于欧几里得几何且失去等距不变性。

Method: 基于下界、分层OT和一维OT积分规则，提出新的切片技术，避免二次规划问题。

Result: 新切片FGW显著减少计算量，保持等距不变性，适用于任意几何，且在形状检索和图同构测试中表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 新切片距离不仅定义了一个伪度量，还提供了GW和切片Wasserstein之间的插值特性，计算更高效且可靠。

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则系统的动态特征选择（DFS）方法，提高了决策的可解释性，并量化了特征查询的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态特征选择方法无法适应个体样本需求，且现有DFS方法模型不透明，限制了在临床决策等透明性要求高的场景中的应用。

Method: 采用基于规则的系统作为DFS的基础分类器，通过约束特征搜索空间降低计算复杂度，并量化特征查询的不确定性。

Result: 该方法在性能上与现有贪婪和强化学习方法竞争，同时提供了更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于规则的DFS方法在保持性能的同时显著提升了决策透明度和计算效率。

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

Motivation: 现有PEFT策略未能利用MoE的动态路由机制，因此研究是否应在适配模块中引入路由机制以匹配MoE的多专家架构。

Method: 分析了PEFT应用于MoE语言模型时的核心组件动态，并研究了不同路由策略对适配效果的影响。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

TL;DR: PPF框架通过二级性能预测自动生成动态/静态剪枝策略，显著提升LLM剪枝效率与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非均匀剪枝方法依赖人工设计策略，无法适应动态剪枝需求且评估耗时。

Method: PPF利用轻量级性能预测器实时评估剪枝策略，结合自适应代理生成剪枝动作。

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Llama3-8B上，PPF降低困惑度达33.4%（动态）和84.78%（静态），预测误差<0.0011，评估延迟从分钟级降至秒级。

Conclusion: PPF高效解决了动态剪枝需求与评估瓶颈，显著优于人工设计策略。

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructSynth框架结合LLMs生成能力和结构控制，解决表格数据生成中的低保真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表格数据在低数据量下生成质量低的问题，传统方法和LLMs难以保持数据依赖结构。

Method: 两阶段架构：1) 学习数据的DAG结构；2) 用该结构引导LLM生成高保真数据。

Result: StructSynth生成的数据结构完整性和下游效用显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StructSynth在低数据量和隐私保护间取得平衡，生成高质量合成数据。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为$\epsilon$-softmax的方法，通过放松对称条件来缓解标签噪声问题，并结合对称损失函数实现鲁棒性与学习效果的平衡。

Motivation: 深度神经网络在标签噪声下训练时，现有对称损失函数因过于严格的对称条件导致欠拟合问题。

Method: 提出$\epsilon$-softmax方法，通过修改softmax层输出近似one-hot向量，并结合对称损失函数。

Result: 理论证明$\epsilon$-softmax可实现噪声容忍学习，实验验证其在合成和真实标签噪声下的优越性。

Conclusion: $\epsilon$-softmax方法有效缓解标签噪声问题，同时保持学习效果。

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

Method: 提出ASMR方法，基于客户端更新的角度距离动态排除异常客户端。

Result: 在病理图像分类任务中验证了ASMR的检测能力，并展示了动态调整决策边界的重要性。

Conclusion: ASMR有效提升了联邦学习的鲁棒性，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

Result: ML分类器不仅提供可解释反馈，还与专家评估形成互补，表明其可作为轻量级、任务相关的质量评估指标。

Conclusion: ML分类器支持更透明且临床对齐的3D器官形状生成评估协议。

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Conclusion: 提出的框架为联邦图学习中的数据遗忘问题提供了全面解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

Result: 提出的方法显著优于现有技术，提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，能更有效地解决医学图像分析中的标签噪声问题。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

Motivation: 解决O-RAN中联邦学习（FL）因模型增大导致的训练时间延长问题，以及SFL中频繁数据传输的高通信成本。

Method: 提出SplitMe框架，通过互学习交替训练近实时RIC和非实时RIC的模型，使用零阶技术整合最终模型，并优化资源分配。

Result: SplitMe在成本和收敛性上显著优于SFL、FedAvg和O-RANFed等框架。

Conclusion: SplitMe有效解决了O-RAN中SFL的通信和资源分配问题，提升了训练效率和实时性。

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

Conclusion: JacobiNet解决了PINNs的归一化和边界约束问题，展示了高效、准确和泛化能力。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

*Xudong Wang,Tongxin Li,Chris Ding,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARGNN提出了一种自适应黎曼图神经网络框架，通过学习节点局部几何结构，解决了现有几何GNN难以捕捉图数据复杂几何异质性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据通常具有复杂的几何异质性，现有几何GNN难以同时捕捉树状层次结构和密集社区等多样结构。

Method: ARGNN通过学习连续且各向异性的黎曼度量张量场，使每个节点能自适应确定最优局部几何结构，并结合Ricci流正则化确保几何稳定性。

Result: 理论证明了ARGNN的几何演化收敛性，实验表明其在同质和异质基准数据集上表现优异，并能自适应捕捉多样结构。

Conclusion: ARGNN不仅统一了现有固定或混合曲率GNN，还通过可解释的几何学习为图结构分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

*Ali Forootani,Mohammad Khosravi,Masoud Barati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepKoopFormer结合Transformer和Koopman算子理论，提出了一种稳定且可解释的时间序列预测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在噪声或动态不确定性下的可解释性和稳定性问题。

Method: 采用模块化的编码器-传播器-解码器结构，通过谱约束的线性Koopman算子在潜在空间学习动态。

Result: 在合成系统、气候数据、金融时间序列和电力数据上表现优于LSTM和Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer是一种灵活、可解释且稳健的高维动态预测框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

TL;DR: 通过3x3卷积核和两种技术（CAK和AuGAN），从少量数据中学习音频变换，实现音乐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过少量数据和对抗训练发现独特的音频变换，为效果设计提供新方法。

Method: 使用Conditioning Aware Kernels（CAK）和AuGAN技术，通过对抗训练验证控制应用。

Result: 学习到的卷积核具有对角结构，能产生频率依赖的时间偏移，实现音乐效果。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可从少量数据中发现音频变换，为效果设计开辟新途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LOST的新方法，通过巧妙结合低秩和稀疏结构，在大规模语言模型（LLMs）的预训练中显著降低计算和内存成本，同时保持或超越全秩模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在多种任务中表现优异，但其庞大的规模导致预训练的计算和内存成本过高。现有方法在结合低秩和稀疏结构时表现不佳，导致性能下降。

Method: LOST利用奇异值分解（SVD）保留权重矩阵的主导低秩成分，并将剩余奇异值用于构建通道级稀疏成分，以补充低秩训练的表示能力。

Result: 实验表明，LOST在60M到7B参数的LLM预训练中，性能与全秩模型相当或更优，同时显著降低了内存和计算开销。

Conclusion: LOST是一种高效且性能优越的LLM预训练方法，为大规模模型训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多LLM协作中计算成本与集体性能之间的权衡问题，避免传统方法中的搭便车行为。

Method: 引入MAC-SPGG框架，通过顺序决策和重新设计的公共物品奖励，确保努力贡献成为唯一均衡解。

Result: 实验表明，MAC-SPGG训练的模型在推理、数学、代码生成等任务上优于单模型和其他协作方法。

Conclusion: MAC-SPGG为多智能体语言生成提供了一种可扩展且稳健的合作框架。

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Conclusion: 该分类法为评估当前AI系统和预测未来自主AI发展提供了基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出CA-MER基准测试MLLMs在情感冲突场景下的表现，并开发MoSEAR框架以平衡模态依赖，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在多模态情感推理中忽视情感冲突场景，导致对音频信号的过度依赖。

Method: 提出MoSEAR框架，包含MoSE模块（减少模态偏见的微调头）和AR模块（推理时重新平衡模态贡献）。

Result: MoSEAR在多个基准测试中表现最佳，尤其在模态冲突条件下。

Conclusion: MoSEAR有效缓解情感冲突，提升性能，且不牺牲单一模态表现。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期以来'状态'概念缺乏共识和形式化清晰度的问题，为智能定义、形式逻辑和科学理论提供数学基础。

Method: 提出'分层状态网格'和'中间元宇宙（IMU）'，构建元理论框架，扩展跨数学、语言和代理的通用表达性。

Result: 建立了一个基于'定义=状态'原则的元形式逻辑框架，适用于时间、语言、代理和操作。

Conclusion: 该研究为智能定义和科学理论提供了数学上稳健的基础，并扩展了跨领域的通用表达性。

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

TL;DR: 研究提出AgentTTS框架，解决多阶段复杂任务中测试时计算资源分配问题，显著提升效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单阶段任务的测试时扩展（TTS），而现实问题多为多阶段复杂任务，需针对每个子任务分配特定计算资源。

Method: 通过大量实验总结三个经验性洞察，提出基于LLM代理的框架AgentTTS，自主搜索最优计算资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，AgentTTS在搜索效率和鲁棒性上显著优于传统方法和其他基于LLM的基线。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为多阶段复杂任务中的计算资源分配提供了高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ff4ERA的模糊框架，用于量化伦理风险，支持人工智能系统在伦理决策中做出符合人类价值观的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着共生AI的发展，伦理风险增加，需要一种灵活、透明且稳健的伦理风险评估（ERA）框架来解决不确定性、模糊性和信息不完整的问题。

Method: 结合模糊逻辑、模糊层次分析法（FAHP）和确定性因子（CF），通过伦理风险评分（ERS）量化风险。

Result: 案例研究表明，ff4ERA能生成具有上下文敏感性的伦理风险评分，且对无关输入保持稳健。

Conclusion: ff4ERA框架能够提供可解释、可追踪的伦理评估，支持假设分析和设计优化。

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Kahneman和Tversky的‘前景理论’是否适用于大型语言模型，探索模型是否捕捉人类的风险决策偏差。

Method: 通过实验测试LLM在不同情境（如军事与民用）下的风险决策行为，分析其与‘前景理论’的契合度。

Result: LLM表现出与人类相似的风险偏好，情境（如‘框架效应’）对决策影响显著，军事场景的‘框架效应’更强。

Conclusion: 语言模型反映了人类的风险决策偏差，但其表现受情境影响；研究为LLM的推理与记忆机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在简单事实查询中表现良好，但在需要组合推理的任务中效果不佳，导致逻辑不合理的推理过程。

Method: CHECK框架借鉴编译器的类比，先对推理链进行语义分析，再执行推理链回答问题，并通过逻辑优化和重新提示模型来修正语义错误。

Result: 在四个数据集上，CHECK相比五种先进框架平均提升了22.8%的多跳问答准确率。

Conclusion: CHECK通过语义分析和逻辑优化显著提升了组合推理任务中的知识编辑效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning
through structured prompt engineering, implements intelligent parameter
extraction and task decomposition, and provides an extended CodeBLEU metric to
evaluate the quality of TCL scripts. Results from experiments over five
previously curated benchmarks show improvements in automation accuracy and
efficiency, as well as script quality when compared to existing methods.

interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类错误导致的多车碰撞是最常见的交通事故类型，自动驾驶系统需要通过V2X通信扩展感知能力，但现有方法存在泛化能力不足、推理浅显和单模态输入依赖等问题。

Method: REACT结合轻量级VLM和专用模块处理多模态输入，优化风险感知轨迹，并通过边缘适应策略降低模型复杂度，加速推理。

Result: 在DeepAccident基准测试中，REACT实现了77%的碰撞率降低、48.2%的VPQ和0.57秒的推理延迟，性能领先。

Conclusion: 轻量级VLM在实时边缘协同规划中可行，语言引导的上下文推理能显著提升自动驾驶的安全性和响应性。

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI输出中突然从正确转向错误的问题，揭示其潜在的不稳定性，以提高透明度和性能。

Method: 建立多自旋热系统的数学映射，揭示基本注意力单元的隐藏不稳定性，并推导触发点的公式。

Result: 发现AI输出中存在隐藏的不稳定性，推导出触发点的公式，揭示了用户提示和训练偏见的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于提高AI的透明度和性能，并为用户风险和法律责任提供量化依据。

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索社会经济指标是否能在卫星图像和互联网文本中留下可恢复的痕迹，以预测家庭财富。

Method: 使用DHS数据，结合卫星图像和LLM生成的文本，开发多模态预测框架，包括五种预测管道。

Result: 多模态框架优于单一方法（R-squared 0.77 vs. 0.63），LLM知识比代理检索文本更有效，部分表征收敛。

Conclusion: 多模态方法有效预测财富，LLM知识更稳健，代理数据引入独特结构，发布大规模数据集。

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要在动态分布的不同场景中运行，但现有深度学习方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，限制了其实际应用。受海马体记忆回放机制的启发，作者提出了H2C方法。

Method: H2C通过两种互补策略选择代表性样本：一种最大化样本间多样性以保留独特知识，另一种通过等概率采样估计整体知识。随后，通过记忆回放损失函数更新模型。

Conclusion: H2C通过模拟海马体机制，有效解决了轨迹预测中的持续学习问题，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.
The implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

TL;DR: 研究发现Chain-of-Thought (CoT)推理在超出训练数据分布时表现脆弱，其有效性受限于训练与测试数据的分布一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CoT推理是否仅是对训练数据分布的结构化归纳偏置，而非真正的推理能力。

Method: 通过任务、长度和格式三个维度，使用DataAlchemy环境训练LLMs并系统测试其在不同分布条件下的表现。

Result: CoT推理在超出训练分布时失效，表明其能力有限。

Conclusion: CoT推理并非真正的泛化推理能力，其有效性依赖于数据分布的一致性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Motivation: 现有基准测试面临高质量测试套件构建成本高和数据污染风险增加的问题，需要一种更高效、可靠的评估方法。

Method: 基于重要性采样理论和重要性加权自编码器，BIS通过重新加权现有标注基准的样本来预测新基准的性能，并引入权重截断策略和边际期望计算以稳定估计。

Result: 在4个CodeLlama模型和9个基准上的实验显示，BIS对代码正确性分数的平均绝对预测误差为1.1%，最佳和最差误差分别为0.3%和1.9%。

Conclusion: BIS作为一种补充工具，在资源受限的情况下支持基准开发和验证，为提示选择和污染评估提供快速反馈，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有故障诊断模型在复杂场景（如分布偏移）中缺乏严格的风险控制和可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 将故障检测转化为假设检验任务，基于模型残差定义非共形度量，利用校准数据集计算新样本的p值，构建预测集。

Conclusion: 该方法为故障检测提供了理论框架，实现了明确的风险控制，提升了安全关键应用中诊断系统的可信度。

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

Result: 提出了Sketch2Diagram Benchmark数据集，包含8类图表和6,000多个高质量示例，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SketchAgent在设计和工程等领域具有潜力，为草图与机器可读图表之间的转换提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

Result: KV缓存内存减少68%，推理速度提升3.2倍，验证损失降低6.9%，生成质量提升。

Conclusion: 架构创新而非参数扩展定义了资源受限语言模型部署的效率前沿。

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

Motivation: 小型语言模型因其高效性和可部署性在资源受限环境中受到重视，但针对其的成员推理攻击研究较少，且攻击效果随模型规模减小而降低。

Method: 提出了一种基于现有先进攻击方法（min-k）的新攻击方法win-k，并在三个数据集和八个SLMs上进行了实验评估。

Result: win-k在AUROC、TPR @ 1% FPR和FPR @ 99% TPR等指标上优于现有攻击方法，尤其是在较小模型上表现更佳。

Conclusion: win-k是一种针对SLMs的有效成员推理攻击方法，尤其在小型模型上表现突出。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their

between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

TL;DR: Multi-TW是首个针对繁体中文的多模态基准测试，评估任意模态模型的性能和延迟，填补了现有基准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准常忽略繁体中文的三模态评估和推理延迟，Multi-TW旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Multi-TW包含900道多选题（图文、音频文本对），基于SC-TOP开发的官方测试，评估了多种任意模态模型和视觉语言模型。

Result: 闭源模型在多模态任务中表现优于开源模型，但开源模型在音频任务中表现良好；端到端任意模态管道在延迟上优于视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: Multi-TW全面展示了模型能力，强调了繁体中文微调和高效多模态架构的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学研究中识别新颖假设至关重要，但现有自动化方法在生成新颖且证据支持的假设、迭代优化和时间评估方面存在不足。

Method: BioDisco采用语言模型推理和双模式证据系统（生物医学知识图谱和自动化文献检索），结合内部评分和反馈循环进行迭代优化，并通过时间和人类评估验证性能。

Result: 评估显示BioDisco在新颖性和显著性上优于现有架构的简化配置。

Conclusion: BioDisco是一个灵活、模块化的工具，可轻松集成自定义语言模型或知识图谱，有望成为新假设发现的催化剂。

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在规划任务中的表现，提出了一种基于自然语言处理的恢复流程，以提高生成计划的质量和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在规划任务中表现不稳定，生成的计划常包含错误或虚构动作，现有评估方法主要关注成功率，缺乏对计划质量的全面分析。

Method: 提出了一种基于NLP的恢复流程，包括对生成计划的NLP评估、三个阶段恢复计划，并最终通过符号规划器完成计划。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在计划生成中缺乏明确推理，恢复流程仅将成功率从21.9%提高到27.5%，且平均仅前2.65个动作可执行。

Conclusion: 尽管恢复流程有所改进，LLMs在规划任务中的质量和可靠性仍不及传统规划器。

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

Motivation: 随着LLM在多个领域的广泛应用，确保其安全性成为关键问题。现有方法依赖迭代提示工程或语义转换，但效果有限。

Method: 设计了三种字谜类型（单词搜索、字谜重组、填字游戏），要求LLM解谜以还原有害指令并生成响应。

Result: 在五种先进LLM上测试，平均攻击成功率为88.8%，其中GPT-4.1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet分别达到96.5%和92.3%。

Conclusion: PUZZLED通过简单的字谜设计，有效利用LLM的推理能力，成为一种高效且难以防御的越狱策略。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 探讨大规模AI系统如何改变人与机器之间的任务分配，并寻找稳定的均衡状态。

Result: 存在稳定均衡，自动化比例长期为α/(α+β)，模拟显示2045年自动化占65%。

Conclusion: 人类将转向监督AI的角色，政策应促进人机协作以实现福利最大化。

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics
in terms of practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM

identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

Conclusion: 研究为社区提供了严格的评估标准和高质量数据集，揭示了小模型在综合任务中的能力上限，为未来GUI代理的发展提供了指导。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

Motivation: 传统基于POI的预测方法无法捕捉探索性行为或城市道路网络的拓扑约束，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 采用道路节点为中心的方法，结合方向性POI聚合和结构图嵌入，使用Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer进行序列建模。

Result: 模型在准确性（提升17%）和MRR（提升10%）上优于现有基线，且在噪声环境下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了开放世界预测问题，为城市规划和导航提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Conclusion: TripTailor有望推动旅行规划代理的发展，使其更好地理解用户需求并生成实用行程。

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

Motivation: 电动车辆配送因电池容量限制需优化充电计划，以应对充电点可用性、成本等因素。

Method: 提出MILP精确解和高效启发式方法，解决NP难问题。

Result: 相比EDF和NDF，充电成本分别降低39%和22%。

Conclusion: CARGO框架在减少充电成本的同时，完成类似配送量。

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Result: WinkTPG能在1秒内为1000个智能体生成速度曲线，解决方案质量提升51.7%。

Conclusion: kTPG和WinkTPG有效解决了多智能体路径规划的动力学可行性和执行优化问题。

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Motivation: 人类反馈成本高且难以扩展，现有迭代精炼方法需要额外资源。Refine-n-Judge旨在通过单一LLM自动完成数据精炼与评估，降低成本并提升效率。

Method: 使用LLM迭代精炼数据并评估每次改进，直到无法进一步提升。生成高质量、带偏好标签的数据序列用于微调。

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge能高效生成高质量数据集，显著提升模型性能，具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

Conclusion: LLMs的偏见表现取决于社会和组织环境，这对多智能体系统和无人监督操作的部署有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在捕捉表格数据复杂关系和适应任务需求方面存在挑战，而语言模型（尤其是大型语言模型）为自动化表格数据准备提供了新机遇。

Method: 系统分析了LMs在表格数据准备四个核心阶段的应用，并结合其他组件提出了任务解决方案。

Result: 总结了LMs在表格数据准备中的关键进展，并提出了未来的研究方向和潜在流程。

Conclusion: LMs在表格数据准备中具有潜力，但仍需系统性探索以充分发挥其作用。

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

TL;DR: GenZ-LTL是一种新方法，通过分解LTL任务为子目标序列，实现零样本泛化，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习中复杂任务目标和安全约束的泛化问题，尤其是嵌套长时任务和不可满足子目标的情况。

Method: 利用Büchi自动机结构分解LTL任务为可达-避免子目标序列，逐个解决子目标，并引入观察缩减技术。

Result: 在零样本泛化到未见LTL规范方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL通过分解和逐个解决子目标，有效提升了泛化能力和处理复杂任务的能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态代理架构在复杂动态环境中的局限性，提供可扩展、动态且可解释的AI解决方案。

Method: 结合组合逻辑、拓扑理论和粗糙模糊集理论，定义SPARK参数空间，利用LLMs参数化复杂空间并进行蒙特卡洛模拟。

Result: 实验显示代理在不同复杂度层级下的适应性趋势，高复杂度时收益递减，揭示了可扩展设计的阈值。

Conclusion: PCF支持生成优化的代理配置，适用于多领域动态AI应用，推动下一代适应性代理的发展。

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补LLMs在定量化学推理能力方面的研究空白。

Method: 设计QCBench基准测试，包含7个化学子领域的350个问题，分为三个难度层级。

Result: 评估19个LLMs显示，随着任务复杂性增加，性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: QCBench揭示了LLMs在科学计算准确性方面的不足，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

TL;DR: T-GRAG是一个动态、时间感知的检索增强生成框架，通过建模知识的时间演化，解决了现有GraphRAG方法在时间动态性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法忽视了知识的时间动态性，导致时间模糊性、时间不敏感检索和语义冗余等问题。

Method: T-GRAG包含五个关键组件：时间知识图谱生成器、时间查询分解机制、三层交互检索器、源文本提取器和基于LLM的生成器。

Result: 实验表明，T-GRAG在时间约束下的检索准确性和响应相关性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 建模知识演化对于长文本问答的鲁棒性至关重要，T-GRAG为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过解决视觉、分布和上下文不确定性，提升医学报告生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻放射科医生的工作负担，解决医学报告生成中的三大不确定性（视觉、标签分布和上下文），以提高系统的临床可信度。

Method: 1. 视觉不确定性：通过Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling模块修正视图标注错误；2. 标签分布不确定性：采用Token Sensitive Learning目标增强关键诊断句的建模；3. 上下文不确定性：通过Contextual Evidence Filter验证历史报告信息。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中，SURE-Med达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度降低不确定性，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准，并推动临床决策支持的可信度。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理的NL2VIS方法，通过透明化设计过程和交互式界面提升可视化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2VIS方法缺乏透明性，用户无法理解设计逻辑或优化输出。

Method: 设计CoT推理流程，构建nvBench-CoT数据集，开发交互式界面DeepVIS。

Result: 定量评估、案例研究和用户研究表明CoT框架显著提升NL2VIS质量。

Conclusion: CoT框架为NL2VIS提供了透明化和交互性，改善了用户体验和输出质量。

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

*Shijie Cao,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReflecSched框架通过结合LLM的战略分析能力，解决了传统调度规则的僵化和深度学习方法的复杂性，显著提升了动态柔性作业车间调度问题的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态柔性作业车间调度（DFJSP）是一个NP难问题，传统调度规则效率高但缺乏灵活性，深度学习方法需要复杂的特征工程且不透明。LLM虽有潜力，但直接应用存在长上下文悖论、专家启发式利用不足和短视决策等问题。

Method: 提出ReflecSched框架，通过LLM分析多规划视野下的启发式模拟，生成“战略经验”摘要，并将其整合到最终决策模块的提示中，以指导非短视的调度决策。

Result: ReflecSched显著优于直接LLM基线（71.35%胜率，2.755%相对百分比偏差减少），并超越所有评估的启发式方法，同时缓解了三大问题。

Conclusion: ReflecSched展示了LLM在复杂调度问题中的潜力，通过战略分析能力实现了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HypoAgents的多智能体协作框架，结合贝叶斯推理和信息熵驱动搜索机制，通过生成、验证和优化假设的闭环流程，显著提升了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学知识的爆炸式增长使得自动生成兼具新颖性、可行性和研究价值的科学假设成为核心挑战，现有方法未能系统建模假设的内在特性或纳入闭环反馈机制。

Method: 提出HypoAgents框架，分三个阶段：假设生成（基于N-R-F评分）、证据验证（使用RAG和贝叶斯定理更新后验概率）、假设优化（通过信息熵识别高不确定性假设并主动优化）。

Result: 在ICLR 2025数据集上，经过12次优化迭代后，假设的平均ELO分数提升116.3，超过真实论文摘要基准17.8，整体不确定性（香农熵）显著降低0.92。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化科学发现提供了一个可解释的概率推理框架，显著提高了机器生成研究假设的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

Result: 实验表明该方法性能与现有求解器相当，能有效扩展到大问题。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了生产者-消费者调度问题，填补了开源求解器的空白。

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

Conclusion: 目标是建立一个基础结构，用于表示和比较推理系统，支持未来在结构约束下的理论和实践研究。

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

Motivation: 现有过程奖励数据构建方法效率低或劳动密集，限制了过程级奖励模型（PRMs）的潜力。

Method: 提出不确定性驱动的框架，自动化生成和标注PRM数据；引入两种不确定性感知的输出聚合方法：混合多数奖励投票和加权奖励频率投票。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性和效率，输出聚合方法进一步提升了PRMs的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和方法显著提升了PRMs的性能，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试局限于单服务器和少量工具，无法有效评估大规模真实场景中的代理能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准测试、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval评估框架，并设计MCP Copilot Agent进行动态规划和API交互。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但不同模型性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为工具丰富且动态的MCP环境提供了首个统一评估框架，支持可扩展和可重复的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in cloud sites remains a critical yet challenging task.
Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProKG Dial是一个基于知识图谱的框架，用于构建高质量领域特定多轮对话数据集，显著提升对话质量和领域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在专业领域缺乏精确性，构建高质量领域特定对话数据集是关键，但现有方法资源密集或质量有限。

Method: 利用知识图谱的结构化特性，通过社区检测分割子图，逐步生成围绕目标实体的问答对，并进行严格过滤。

Result: 在医学知识图谱上验证，生成对话在多样性、语义连贯性和实体覆盖方面表现优异，微调后的模型优于基线。

Conclusion: ProKG Dial有效提升对话质量和领域性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

TL;DR: SNOW是一种基于大型语言模型的模块化多代理系统，能够从非结构化临床笔记中自主生成结构化特征，无需人工干预，性能接近人工特征生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）中的非结构化临床笔记包含丰富信息，但现有方法（如人工特征生成或全自动特征生成）在效率和可解释性上存在不足。

Method: SNOW通过多代理系统（包括特征发现、提取、验证、后处理和聚合）利用大型语言模型自主生成结构化特征。

Result: SNOW在预测前列腺癌复发任务中表现接近人工特征生成方法（AUC-ROC: 0.761 vs 0.771），显著优于基线方法和全自动特征生成方法。

Conclusion: SNOW展示了自主LLM系统可以规模化复制专家级特征工程，同时保持临床部署所需的可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 解决角色扮演对话系统中角色一致性的问题，特别是在回答超出知识范围的问题时。

Method: 提出AMADEUS框架，包含ACTS（自适应文本分割）、GS（引导选择）和AE（属性提取）三个组件，并构建CharacterRAG数据集。

Result: 框架不仅能建模角色的知识，还能捕捉其个性等属性，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AMADEUS在角色扮演对话系统中表现出色，尤其在角色一致性方面具有优势。

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraceAlign是一个框架，用于追踪大型语言模型（LLMs）在训练数据中的不安全生成根源，并提出三种干预措施以减少对齐漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决LLMs在对抗性提示或解码扰动下产生的对齐漂移问题，揭示训练数据中的根源。

Method: 提出Belief Conflict Index (BCI)量化语义不一致性，并开发TraceShield、对比信念解冲突损失和Prov-Decode三种干预措施。

Result: 在Alignment Drift Benchmark上减少85%的对齐漂移，同时保持任务性能（delta<0.2）。

Conclusion: TraceAlign为理解和缓解对齐失败提供了可扩展、可追踪的工具包。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型方法在复杂风险特征识别上表现不佳，且训练成本高、泛化能力差。

Method: 结合外部知识和检索案例上下文，通过提示微调实现高效识别，无需训练。

Result: 实验显示识别准确率提升35.49%，达到50%。

Conclusion: 该方法为风险检测提供了新的理论和实践支持。

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Motivation: 现有方法（如MCTS）忽略了轨迹间的相互依赖性，导致搜索空间缺乏多样性和冗余推理。

Method: 提出SE-Agent框架，通过修订、重组和细化操作迭代优化推理过程，扩展搜索空间并利用跨轨迹灵感。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified上实验表明，SE-Agent相对提升55%，达到开源代理中的最佳性能。

Conclusion: SE-Agent通过自进化机制显著提升推理质量，为复杂任务解决提供了高效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人系统无法直接根据手绘草图生成3D结构的问题，为非专家用户提供便捷的3D建模工具。

Method: 引入抽象关系图捕捉几何关系和稳定性模式，使用组合扩散模型生成3D姿态，并迭代预测隐藏支撑结构。

Result: 在标志性建筑和现代房屋设计中，StackItUp生成的3D结构稳定且视觉相似度优于基线方法。

Conclusion: StackItUp为非专家用户提供了一种高效、稳定的3D建模方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型语言模型（LLM）代理的新型攻击方式——通过操纵工具元数据（如名称、描述等）来影响代理行为，称为“吸引性元数据攻击”（AMA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具为中心的范式引入了新的攻击面，即恶意工具可通过操纵元数据被优先选择，而无需修改模型内部或提示注入。

Method: 提出AMA框架，通过迭代优化生成高吸引力且语法语义有效的工具元数据，在标准工具生态中无缝集成。

Result: 在10个模拟工具使用场景和多种LLM代理中，攻击成功率达81%-95%，且对主任务影响极小。

Conclusion: 元数据操纵是一种隐蔽且有效的攻击面，需超越提示级防御的执行级安全机制。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

Motivation: 随着大型推理模型（如DeepSeek R1）的广泛应用，过度推理问题（如冗长推理链）导致效率下降和准确性受影响，亟需高效推理方法。

Method: 系统回顾高效推理方法研究，将其分为两类：单模型优化（提升单个模型效率）和多模型协作（通过模型协作优化推理路径）。

Result: 总结了当前高效推理方法的研究进展，并提供了公开的GitHub仓库以跟踪最新动态。

Conclusion: 高效推理方法的研究对解决LRMs的过度推理问题具有重要意义，未来需进一步探索单模型和多模型协作的优化策略。

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中对长上下文建模的需求不断增加，但标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为瓶颈。现有稀疏注意力机制虽提升了效率，但仍存在静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: DMA通过动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码和位置感知稀疏注意力计算，实现双稀疏设计，减少计算复杂度并保留关键信息。

Result: 实验表明，DMA在困惑度和多查询关联召回任务中优于多头注意力等方法，并在1.7B参数模型中显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: DMA有效平衡了模型效率与长上下文建模能力，是一种高效且性能优越的注意力机制。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Result: 玩家评分、访谈和情感分析表明，情感弧线集成显著提升了游戏的参与度、叙事连贯性和情感影响。

Conclusion: 情感结构化的程序生成在推动互动叙事发展方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large
language models (LLMs) and adaptive entity generation. Evaluation through
player ratings, interviews, and sentiment analysis shows that emotional arc
integration significantly enhances engagement, narrative coherence, and
emotional impact. These results highlight the potential of emotionally
structured procedural generation for advancing interactive storytelling for
games.

interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种受大脑启发的三部分架构，通过功能专门化和时间动态模拟提升人工认知的灵活性和效率，初步评估显示性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工神经网络在灵活性和通用智能方面存在局限，与生物认知的根本差异在于缺乏功能专门化和时间动态协调。

Method: 提出三部分架构（感知、辅助、执行系统），结合多频神经振荡和突触动态适应机制模拟时间动态。

Result: 在视觉任务中表现优于现有方法，准确率提升2.18%，计算迭代减少48.44%，更接近人类置信模式。

Conclusion: 该架构为跨认知领域的类脑智能提供了理论基础，有望缩小人工与生物智能的差距。

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Result: 在具有认知不确定性的环境中（如随机网格世界和部分可观察的Minigrid任务），该方法优于传统KL控制代理，表现出更稳健的规划和高效探索。

Conclusion: 该方法将主动推理理论与实际实现结合，证明了认知先验在人工代理中的有效性。

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro和OpenAI o3等模型能生成高流量且操作真实的场景，并支持迭代优化。

Conclusion: AirTrafficGen为安全关键领域的复杂规划展示了LLMs的潜力，提供了可扩展的自动化方案。

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Conclusion: Traffic-R1为TSC提供了高效、可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our
checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/Season998/Traffic-R1.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Conclusion: PHM-Bench为LLMs在PHM领域的深入集成提供了关键基准，支持从通用模型向专用模型的过渡。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of
LLMs in PHM and offers a critical benchmark to guide the transition from
general-purpose to PHM-specialized models.

Result: 在多种优化任务中，OptiHive显著优于基线方法，将最复杂问题的优化率从5%提升至92%。

Conclusion: OptiHive提供了一种无需迭代自修正的高效可靠方法，显著提升了LLM求解器的性能。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

Result: 实验表明PI显著缩短推理链，减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架有效提升LLM推理的可控性和可解释性。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法在提高预测精度的同时增强了模型的透明度和可信度，为围产期神经科学中的AI应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

Result: 实验表明CAMA显著提升LLM在数学问题上的性能，结构化指导优于非结构化方法，非对称因果关系效果更佳。

Conclusion: CAMA通过显式数学结构和因果依赖，有效解决了LLM在复杂数学推理中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在处理高维空间中的多模态动作分布时表现出色，但存在表示崩溃问题，导致对细微但关键的变化处理能力不足。

Method: 提出D2PPO，通过分散损失正则化处理批次内所有隐藏表示作为负对，迫使网络学习区分性表示。

Result: 在RoboMimic基准测试中，D2PPO预训练和微调后分别提升22.7%和26.1%，在真实机器人实验中表现优异。

Conclusion: D2PPO通过分散损失正则化有效解决了表示崩溃问题，显著提升了复杂机器人操作任务的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决冷启动场景下新闻推荐性能不足的问题，通过调整ALMM模型以适应新闻推荐任务。

Method: 将ALMM模型从音频特征调整为BERT和TF-IDF提取的新闻文本特征，并重新设计预处理流程。

Result: 改进后的ALMM模型在冷启动场景下表现优于Forbes和Oord基线模型。

Conclusion: 原始ALMM模型需调整才能适用于新闻推荐任务。

Abstract: This replication study modifies ALMM, the Adaptive Linear Mapping Model
constructed for the next song recommendation, to the news recommendation
problem on the MIND dataset. The original version of ALMM computes latent
representations for users, last-time items, and current items in a tensor
factorization structure and learns a linear mapping from content features to
latent item vectors. Our replication aims to improve recommendation performance
in cold-start scenarios by restructuring this model to sequential news click
behavior, viewing consecutively read articles as (last news, next news) tuples.
Instead of the original audio features, we apply BERT and a TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to news titles and abstracts to extract
token contextualized representations and align them with triplet-based user
reading patterns. We also propose a reproducibly thorough pre-processing
pipeline combining news filtering and feature integrity validation. Our
implementation of ALMM with TF-IDF shows relatively improved recommendation
accuracy and robustness over Forbes and Oord baseline models in the cold-start
scenario. We demonstrate that ALMM in a minimally modified state is not
suitable for next news recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中用户评论稀疏，传统填补方法（如矩阵补全或LLM增强）丢失语义或忽略结构依赖。

Method: 构建文本边图（TEG），利用线图视图和大语言模型作为图感知聚合器，生成个性化评论。

Result: 在Amazon和Goodreads数据集上，TWISTER优于传统数值、基于图和LLM的基线，生成更高质量的评论并提升推荐性能。

Conclusion: TWISTER生成的评论更有帮助、真实且具体，同时优化结构信号以改进推荐。

Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference
signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users
rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the
effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate
missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques
-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose
contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook
structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual
Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by
jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent
user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge
attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and
employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction
lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's
natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized
review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER
consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,
delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced
recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more
helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for
improved recommendations.

Abstract: Alignment and uniformity are fundamental principles within the domain of
contrastive learning. In recommender systems, prior work has established that
optimizing the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss contributes to the
objectives of alignment and uniformity. Specifically, alignment aims to draw
together the representations of interacting users and items, while uniformity
mandates a uniform distribution of user and item embeddings across a unit
hypersphere. This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within
the context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among
extant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our
hypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment
through a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with
similar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within
the hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity
between items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution,
thereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities
within the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship
between this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity
function. Moreover, to enhance the fusion of multimodal features, we introduce
a Spherical B\'ezier method designed to integrate an arbitrary number of
modalities while ensuring that the resulting fused features are constrained to
the same hyperspherical manifold. Empirical evaluations conducted on five
real-world datasets substantiate the superiority of our approach over competing
baselines. We also shown that the proposed methods can achieve up to a 5.4%
increase in NDCG@20 performance via the integration of MLLM-extracted features.

Abstract: Providing customized products and services in the modern business world is
one of the most efficient solutions to improve users' experience and their
engagements with the industries. To aim, recommender systems, by producing
personalized recommendations, have a crucial role in the digital age. As a
consequence of modern improvements in the internet and online-based
technologies, using gamification rules also increased in various fields. Recent
studies showed that considering gamification concepts in implementing
recommendation systems not only can become helpful to overcome the cold start
and lack of sufficient data, moreover, can effectively improve user engagement.
Gamification can motivate individuals to have more activities on the system;
these interactions are valuable resources of data for recommender engines.
Unlike the past related works about using gamified recommendation systems in
different environments or studies that particularly surveyed gamification
strategies or recommenders separately, this work provides a comprehensive
review of how gamified recommender systems can enhance user engagement in
various domain applications. Furthermore, comparing different approaches for
building recommender systems is followed by in-depth surveying about
investigating the gamified recommender systems, including their approaches,
limitations, evaluation metrics, proposed achievements, datasets, domain areas,
and their recommendation techniques. This exhaustive analysis provides a
detailed picture of the topic's popularity, gaps, and unexplored regions. It is
envisaged that the proposed research and introduced possible future directions
would serve as a stepping stone for researchers interested in using gamified
recommender systems for user satisfaction and engagement.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了冷启动推荐性能，验证了语义-行为对齐的轻量级方法的有效性。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, predicting Click-Through Rate (CTR) is crucial for
accurately matching users with items. To improve recommendation performance for
cold-start and long-tail items, recent studies focus on leveraging item
multimodal features to model users' interests. However, obtaining multimodal
representations for items relies on complex pre-trained encoders, which incurs
unacceptable computation cost to train jointly with downstream ranking models.
Therefore, it is important to maintain alignment between semantic and behavior
space in a lightweight way.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic-Behavior Alignment for
Cold-start Recommendation framework, which mainly focuses on utilizing
multimodal representations that align with the user behavior space to predict
CTR. First, we leverage domain-specific knowledge to train a multimodal encoder
to generate behavior-aware semantic representations. Second, we use residual
quantized semantic ID to dynamically bridge the gap between multimodal
representations and the ranking model, facilitating the continuous
semantic-behavior alignment. We conduct our offline and online experiments on
the Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, and have achieved
an increase of 0.83% in offline AUC, 13.21% clicks increase and 13.44% orders
increase in the online A/B test, emphasizing the efficacy of our method.

Conclusion: Req-Rec通过推荐相关需求，帮助利益相关者更全面地了解项目。

Abstract: The success or failure of a project is highly related to recognizing the
right stakeholders and accurately finding and discovering their requirements.
However, choosing the proper elicitation technique was always a considerable
challenge for efficient requirement engineering. As a consequence of the swift
improvement of digital technologies since the past decade, recommender systems
have become an efficient channel for making a deeply personalized interactive
communication with stakeholders. In this research, a new method, called the
Req-Rec (Requirements Recommender), is proposed. It is a hybrid recommender
system based on the collaborative filtering approach and the repertory grid
technique as the core component. The primary goal of Req-Rec is to increase
stakeholder satisfaction by assisting them in the requirement elicitation
phase. Based on the results, the method efficiently could overcome weaknesses
of common requirement elicitation techniques, such as time limitation,
location-based restrictions, and bias in requirements' elicitation process.
Therefore, recommending related requirements assists stakeholders in becoming
more aware of different aspects of the project.

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and
diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant
suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability
remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback
or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid
recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with
Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used
to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful
profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These
enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie
bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering
model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that
combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust
negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated
recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language
justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark
datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms
strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the
cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work
demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and
interpretability of recommender systems.

Motivation: 现有通用文本嵌入模型无法准确表示复杂化学术语，导致检索效果不佳，需开发专用模型。

Method: 基于化学文本数据集（PubChem、Semantic Scholar、ChemRxiv）微调嵌入模型，生成170万高质量查询-段落对，并添加900个化学专用令牌。

Result: 在ChemRxiv Retrieval基准测试中，ChEmbed将nDCG@10从0.82提升至0.91（+9个百分点）。

Conclusion: ChEmbed是一种轻量、可复现的解决方案，显著提升了化学文献检索效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on
accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However,
general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent
complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality.
Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not
yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this
challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding
models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the
PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training
data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries,
resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs.
Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized
tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the
fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains
a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer
passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically
have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced
ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general
embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents
a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively
improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

Motivation: 互惠推荐系统（如约会、游戏和人才平台）中，由于历史曝光策略导致数据偏向热门用户，形成反馈循环，影响学习和公平性。

Method: 提出Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender Systems（CFRR），采用逆倾向评分和自我归一化的目标函数。

Result: 实验显示，CFRR在NDCG@10上提升3.5%，长尾用户覆盖率增加51%，基尼曝光不平等性降低24%。

Conclusion: CFRR为更准确和公平的用户匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems (RRS) in dating, gaming, and talent platforms
require mutual acceptance for a match. Logged data, however, over-represents
popular profiles due to past exposure policies, creating feedback loops that
skew learning and fairness. We introduce Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender
Systems (CFRR), a causal framework to mitigate this bias. CFRR uses inverse
propensity scored, self-normalized objectives. Experiments show CFRR improves
NDCG@10 by up to 3.5% (e.g., from 0.459 to 0.475 on DBLP, from 0.299 to 0.307
on Synthetic), increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51% (from 0.504 to
0.763 on Synthetic), and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24% (from
0.708 to 0.535 on Synthetic). CFRR offers a promising approach for more
accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly explored as
general-purpose tools for recommendation tasks, enabling zero-shot and
instruction-following capabilities without the need for task-specific training.
While the research community is enthusiastically embracing LLMs, there are
important caveats to directly adapting them for recommendation tasks. In this
paper, we show that LLM-based recommendation models suffer from position bias,
where the order of candidate items in a prompt can disproportionately influence
the recommendations produced by LLMs. First, we analyse the position bias of
LLM-based recommendations on real-world datasets, where results uncover
systemic biases of LLMs with high sensitivity to input orders. Furthermore, we
introduce a new prompting strategy to mitigate the position bias of LLM
recommendation models called Ranking via Iterative SElection (RISE). We compare
our proposed method against various baselines on key benchmark datasets.
Experiment results show that our method reduces sensitivity to input ordering
and improves stability without requiring model fine-tuning or post-processing.

Conclusion: 生成式注意力机制更灵活且表达能力强，为序列推荐提供了新方向。

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) focuses on personalizing user experiences by
predicting future preferences based on historical interactions. Transformer
models, with their attention mechanisms, have become the dominant architecture
in SR tasks due to their ability to capture dependencies in user behavior
sequences. However, traditional attention mechanisms, where attention weights
are computed through query-key transformations, are inherently linear and
deterministic. This fixed approach limits their ability to account for the
dynamic and non-linear nature of user preferences, leading to challenges in
capturing evolving interests and subtle behavioral patterns. Given that
generative models excel at capturing non-linearity and probabilistic
variability, we argue that generating attention distributions offers a more
flexible and expressive alternative compared to traditional attention
mechanisms. To support this claim, we present a theoretical proof demonstrating
that generative attention mechanisms offer greater expressiveness and
stochasticity than traditional deterministic approaches. Building upon this
theoretical foundation, we introduce two generative attention models for SR,
each grounded in the principles of Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Diffusion
Models (DMs), respectively. These models are designed specifically to generate
adaptive attention distributions that better align with variable user
preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show our models
significantly outperform state-of-the-art in both accuracy and diversity.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research
attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains
limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly
in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23
empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been
conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate,
turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours
are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges,
including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address
these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative
analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for
LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more
transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双向生成管道，用于构建层次化查询和丰富相关性标签的金融段落检索数据集（FinCPRG）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在表达跨文档查询需求和控制标注质量方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用双向生成管道，包括自下而上（从单文档生成查询）和自上而下（从多文档标题生成查询）两种方法，并挖掘额外的相关性标签。

Result: 构建了FinCPRG数据集，包含层次化查询和丰富相关性标签，并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: FinCPRG可作为训练和基准测试的有效段落检索数据集。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods
still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling
annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical
queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional
relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces
two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from
multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate
structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from
intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial
elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and
prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance
annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the
generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method
to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed
a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k
Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and
rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,
benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and
validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training
and benchmarking.

TL;DR: CAVE是一种个性化的消费感知列表价值估计框架，通过建模用户退出行为和子列表价值，优化推荐列表的排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略用户可能在消费完整列表前退出的情况，导致估计值与实际消费值不匹配。

Method: CAVE将列表价值建模为子列表价值的期望，加权用户特定退出概率，并分解退出概率为兴趣驱动和随机成分。

Result: 在多个数据集和在线A/B测试中，CAVE表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模用户退出行为能显著提升重排序效果。

Abstract: Re-ranking is critical in recommender systems for optimizing the order of
recommendation lists, thus improving user satisfaction and platform revenue.
Most existing methods follow a generator-evaluator paradigm, where the
evaluator estimates the overall value of each candidate list. However, they
often ignore the fact that users may exit before consuming the full list,
leading to a mismatch between estimated generation value and actual consumption
value. To bridge this gap, we propose CAVE, a personalized Consumption-Aware
list Value Estimation framework. CAVE formulates the list value as the
expectation over sub-list values, weighted by user-specific exit probabilities
at each position. The exit probability is decomposed into an interest-driven
component and a stochastic component, the latter modeled via a Weibull
distribution to capture random external factors such as fatigue. By jointly
modeling sub-list values and user exit behavior, CAVE yields a more faithful
estimate of actual list consumption value. We further contribute three
large-scale real-world list-wise benchmarks from the Kuaishou platform, varying
in size and user activity patterns. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks,
two Amazon datasets, and online A/B testing on Kuaishou show that CAVE
consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the benefit of
explicitly modeling user exits in re-ranking.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需学习的二进制哈希方法VDeH，利用Voronoi图的特性，在性能和计算成本上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习哈希方法（L2H）存在局限性，如学习过程可能并非性能提升的关键，且方法局限于特定哈希函数类型。

Method: 提出Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing (VDeH)，通过数据依赖的相似性度量构建哈希函数，并生成独立的二进制位。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，VDeH在相同比特长度下表现优于现有方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: VDeH展示了Voronoi图在哈希中的潜力，提供了一种高效且无需学习的替代方案。

Abstract: The goal of learning to hash (L2H) is to derive data-dependent hash functions
from a given data distribution in order to map data from the input space to a
binary coding space. Despite the success of L2H, two observations have cast
doubt on the source of the power of L2H, i.e., learning. First, a recent study
shows that even using a version of locality sensitive hashing functions without
learning achieves binary representations that have comparable accuracy as those
of L2H, but with less time cost. Second, existing L2H methods are constrained
to three types of hash functions: thresholding, hyperspheres, and hyperplanes
only. In this paper, we unveil the potential of Voronoi diagrams in hashing.
Voronoi diagram is a suitable candidate because of its three properties. This
discovery has led us to propose a simple and efficient no-learning binary
hashing method, called Voronoi Diagram Encoded Hashing (VDeH), which constructs
a set of hash functions through a data-dependent similarity measure and
produces independent binary bits through encoded hashing. We demonstrate
through experiments on several benchmark datasets that VDeH achieves superior
performance and lower computational cost compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods under the same bit length.

Motivation: 传统推荐系统难以捕捉时尚领域的动态变化和复杂用户偏好，导致用户满意度下降和退货率上升。

Method: 论文提出了一种混合模态细化（AMMR）管道，结合多模态编码器、代理LLM规划器和动态检索技术。

Result: AMMR能够更好地表达用户意图并适应快速变化的时尚库存。

Conclusion: 未来的时尚推荐系统需要向自适应、生成式和利益相关者感知的方向发展，以满足用户和品牌的期望。

Abstract: Fashion recommender systems (FaRS) face distinct challenges due to rapid
trend shifts, nuanced user preferences, intricate item-item compatibility, and
the complex interplay among consumers, brands, and influencers. Traditional
recommendation approaches, largely static and retrieval-focused, struggle to
effectively capture these dynamic elements, leading to decreased user
satisfaction and elevated return rates. This paper synthesizes both academic
and industrial viewpoints to map the distinctive output space and stakeholder
ecosystem of modern FaRS, identifying the complex interplay among users,
brands, platforms, and influencers, and highlighting the unique data and
modeling challenges that arise.
  We outline a research agenda for industrial FaRS, centered on five
representative scenarios spanning static queries, outfit composition, and
multi-turn dialogue, and argue that mixed-modality refinement-the ability to
combine image-based references (anchors) with nuanced textual constraints-is a
particularly critical task for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose
an Agentic Mixed-Modality Refinement (AMMR) pipeline, which fuses multimodal
encoders with agentic LLM planners and dynamic retrieval, bridging the gap
between expressive user intent and fast-changing fashion inventories. Our work
shows that moving beyond static retrieval toward adaptive, generative, and
stakeholder-aware systems is essential to satisfy the evolving expectations of
fashion consumers and brands.

Motivation: 解决多轮RAG和Graph RAG在性能和效率上的权衡问题，减少幻觉并整合外部知识到大型语言模型（LLMs）中。

Method: 提出T$^2$RAG框架，利用LLM将问题分解为可搜索的三元组，并通过迭代检索从三元组数据库中获取证据。

Result: 在六个数据集上平均性能提升11%，检索成本降低45%。

Conclusion: T$^2$RAG在性能和效率上优于现有方法，为RAG系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is critical for reducing hallucinations
and incorporating external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, advanced RAG systems face a trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Multi-round RAG approaches achieve strong reasoning but incur
excessive LLM calls and token costs, while Graph RAG methods suffer from
computationally expensive, error-prone graph construction and retrieval
redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose T$^2$RAG, a novel framework
that operates on a simple, graph-free knowledge base of atomic triplets.
T$^2$RAG leverages an LLM to decompose questions into searchable triplets with
placeholders, which it then iteratively resolves by retrieving evidence from
the triplet database. Empirical results show that T$^2$RAG significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art multi-round and Graph RAG methods, achieving an
average performance gain of up to 11\% across six datasets while reducing
retrieval costs by up to 45\%. Our code is available at

Motivation: 在数字经济的背景下，推荐系统面临用户行为序列稀疏性和强时空依赖性的挑战，作者通过类比人类记忆的遗忘过程来解决这些问题。

Method: STIM方法包括基于遗忘曲线的动态掩码模块、查询驱动的专家混合（MoE）方法以及分层多兴趣网络单元，用于协同建模时间、位置和物品。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示，STIM方法提升了1.54%的总交易额（GTV），离线实验也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: STIM方法已成功部署于大规模本地生活服务推荐系统，服务于数亿日活跃用户。

Abstract: In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a
key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling
user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity
of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be
addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This
is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect
and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the
forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)
with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates
three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,
which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic
spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that
can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling
the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical
multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by
modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics
of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online
A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).
In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has
been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system,
serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application
scenarios.

Motivation: UGC平台中用户意图模糊和内容噪声大，导致现有方法在相关性评估上表现不佳。

Method: 提出R3A模型，利用高排名文档推断查询意图，并通过片段提取减少噪声影响，结合强化学习优化。

Result: 实验表明R3A在离线和在线实验中均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: R3A有效解决了UGC平台中的相关性评估挑战，提升了检索增强生成的效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated
content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate
relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in
applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms
present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback
in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and
unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced
Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed
reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A
first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer
latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify
relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a
reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions
arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results
show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of
relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态检索中的中心性问题长期存在，现有方法未能充分理解其机制，导致效果不佳。

Method: 分析了Inverted Softmax方法，提出概率平衡框架，并引入Sinkhorn Normalization（SN）和Dual Bank Sinkhorn Normalization（DBSN）来平衡查询和目标概率。

Result: 在多种跨模态检索任务中，SN和DBSN均表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DBSN通过缩小查询与目标之间的分布差距，有效解决了中心性问题，为跨模态检索提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The past decade has witnessed rapid advancements in cross-modal retrieval,
with significant progress made in accurately measuring the similarity between
cross-modal pairs. However, the persistent hubness problem, a phenomenon where
a small number of targets frequently appear as nearest neighbors to numerous
queries, continues to hinder the precision of similarity measurements. Despite
several proposed methods to reduce hubness, their underlying mechanisms remain
poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we analyze the widely-adopted Inverted
Softmax approach and demonstrate its effectiveness in balancing target
probabilities during retrieval. Building on these insights, we propose a
probability-balancing framework for more effective hubness reduction. We
contend that balancing target probabilities alone is inadequate and, therefore,
extend the framework to balance both query and target probabilities by
introducing Sinkhorn Normalization (SN). Notably, we extend SN to scenarios
where the true query distribution is unknown, showing that current methods,
which rely solely on a query bank to estimate target hubness, produce
suboptimal results due to a significant distributional gap between the query
bank and targets. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Dual Bank Sinkhorn
Normalization (DBSN), incorporating a corresponding target bank alongside the
query bank to narrow this distributional gap. Our comprehensive evaluation
across various cross-modal retrieval tasks, including image-text retrieval,
video-text retrieval, and audio-text retrieval, demonstrates consistent
performance improvements, validating the effectiveness of both SN and DBSN. All
codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ppanzx/DBSN.

Abstract: The differential-linear connectivity table (DLCT), introduced by Bar-On et
al. at EUROCRYPT'19, is a novel tool that captures the dependency between the
two subciphers involved in differential-linear attacks. This paper is devoted
to exploring the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions. First, by
refining specific exponential sums, we propose two classes of power functions
over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ with low differential-linear uniformity (DLU). Next, we
further investigate the differential-linear properties of $(n,n)$-functions
that are polynomials by utilizing power functions with known DLU. Specifically,
by combining a cubic function with quadratic functions, and employing
generalized cyclotomic mappings, we construct several classes of
$(n,n)$-functions with low DLU, including some that achieve optimal or
near-optimal DLU compared to existing results.

Abstract: The advent of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has
provided new opportunities for capacity improvement via strategic antenna
deployment, especially when the near-field effect is pronounced due to antenna
proliferation. In this paper, we investigate the optimal antenna placement for
maximizing the achievable rate of a point-to-point near-field channel, where
the transmitter is deployed with massive movable antennas. First, we propose a
novel design framework to explore the relationship between antenna positions
and achievable data rate. By introducing the continuous antenna position
function (APF) and antenna density function (ADF), we reformulate the antenna
position design problem from the discrete to the continuous domain, which
maximizes the achievable rate functional with respect to ADF. Leveraging
functional analysis and variational methods, we derive the optimal ADF
condition and propose a gradient-based algorithm for numerical solutions under
general channel conditions. Furthermore, for the near-field line-of-sight (LoS)
scenario, we present a closed-form solution for the optimal ADF, revealing the
critical role of edge antenna density in enhancing the achievable rate.
Finally, we propose a flexible antenna array-based deployment method that
ensures practical implementation while mitigating mutual coupling issues.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework,
with uniform circular arrays emerging as a promising geometry for balancing
performance and deployment feasibility in near-field communications.

Conclusion: ToMA阵列通过动态天线部署和优化算法，有效提升了机载通信的安全性和性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel towed movable antenna (ToMA) array architecture
to enhance the physical layer security of airborne communication systems.
Unlike conventional onboard arrays with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the
ToMA array employs multiple subarrays mounted on flexible cables and towed by
distributed drones, enabling agile deployment in three-dimensional (3D) space
surrounding the central aircraft. This design significantly enlarges the
effective array aperture and allows dynamic geometry reconfiguration, offering
superior spatial resolution and beamforming flexibility. We consider a secure
transmission scenario where an airborne transmitter communicates with multiple
legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers. To ensure
security, zero-forcing beamforming is employed to nullify signal leakage toward
eavesdroppers. Based on the statistical distributions of locations of users and
eavesdroppers, the antenna position vector (APV) of the ToMA array is optimized
to maximize the users' ergodic achievable rate. Analytical results for the case
of a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure
that minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario,
we develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging
Riemannian manifold optimization. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
ToMA array achieves significant performance gains over conventional onboard FPA
arrays, especially in scenarios where eavesdroppers are closely located to
users under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant channels.

Abstract: Constant-dimension subspace codes (CDCs), a special class of subspace codes,
have attracted significant attention due to their applications in network
coding. A fundamental research problem of CDCs is to determine the maximum
number of codewords under the given parameters. The paper first proposes the
construction of parallel cosets of optimal Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes
(FDRMCs) by employing the list of CDCs and inverse list of CDCs. Then a new
class of CDCs is obtained by combining the parallel cosets of optimal FDRMCs
with parallel linkage construction. Next, we present a novel set of identifying
vectors and provide a new construction of CDCs via the multilevel constuction.
Finally, the coset construction is inserted into the multilevel construction
and three classes of large CDCs are provided, one of which is constructed by
using new optimal FDRMCs. Our results establish at least 65 new lower bounds
for CDCs with larger sizes than the previously best known codes.

Motivation: 带限直接检测信道的容量因接收机非线性而难以计算或逼近，需要一种高效且复杂度可控的检测方法。

Method: 设计了广义向量近似消息传递（GVAMP）检测器，结合多级编码和连续干扰消除技术，应用于具有长符号间干扰的光纤信道。

Result: 双极性调制在光放大链路中接近相干容量的0.3 bpcu，功率效率比单极性调制高6 dB，检测器对信道参数变化具有鲁棒性。GVAMP复杂度显著低于现有神经网络方法。

Conclusion: GVAMP检测器在复杂度和性能上优于现有技术，适用于实际光纤通信系统。

Abstract: The capacity of bandlimited direct-detection channels is difficult to compute
or approach because of the receiver nonlinearity. A generalized vector
approximate message passing (GVAMP) detector is designed to achieve high rates
with reasonable complexity. The rates increase by using multi-level coding and
successive interference cancellation. The methods are applied to optical fiber
channels with long intersymbol interference, as encountered in practice.
Bipolar modulation operates within 0.3 bits per channel use (bpcu) of the
real-alphabet coherent capacity for optically-amplified links, improving the
best existing gap of 1 bpcu based on theory. Remarkably, bipolar modulation
gains 6 decibels (dB) in power efficiency over unipolar modulation, and 3 dB
for unamplified links. The detector is robust to changes in channel parameters
such as the fiber length. The GVAMP complexity, measured in multiplications per
information bit (mpib), is proportional to the number of iterations and the
logarithm of the block length, and is substantially less than state-of-the-art
neural networks. The receiver requires approximately 38 iterations to achieve a
rate of 5 bpcu with 80 mpib.

redundancy. A theoretical framework for systematic FCCs to channels matched to
the Lee metric has been studied recently, which introduced function-correcting
Lee codes (FCLCs) and also derived upper and lower bounds on their optimal
redundancy. In this paper, we propose a Plotkin-like bound for irregular
Lee-distance codes, which improves an existing bound. We construct explicit
FCLCs for specific classes of functions, including the Lee weight, Lee weight
distribution, modular sum, and locally bounded function. For these functions,
lower bounds on redundancy are obtained, and our constructions are shown to be
optimal in certain cases. Finally, a comparative analysis with classical Lee
error-correcting codes and codes correcting errors in function values
demonstrates that FCLCs can significantly reduce redundancy while preserving
function correctness.

Conclusion: AirFC系统通过RIS辅助的MIMO配置成功模拟了神经网络的全连接层，展示了其在无线计算中的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided
multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) OAC systems designed to emulate the
fully-connected (FC) layer of a neural network (NN) via analog OAC, where the
RIS and the transceivers are jointly adjusted to engineer the ambient wireless
propagation environment to emulate the weights of the target FC layer. We refer
to this novel computational paradigm as AirFC. We first study the case in which
the precoder, combiner, and RIS phase shift matrices are jointly optimized to
minimize the mismatch between the OAC system and the target FC layer. To solve
this non-convex optimization problem, we propose a low-complexity alternating
optimization algorithm, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all
optimization variables are derived. Next, we consider training of the system
parameters using two distinct learning strategies, namely centralized training
and distributed training. In the centralized training approach, training is
performed at either the transmitter or the receiver, whichever possesses the
channel state information (CSI), and the trained parameters are provided to the
other terminal. In the distributed training approach, the transmitter and
receiver iteratively update their parameters through back and forth
transmissions by leveraging channel reciprocity, thereby avoiding CSI
acquisition and significantly reducing computational complexity. Subsequently,
we extend our analysis to a multi-RIS scenario by exploiting its spatial
diversity gain to enhance the system performance. Simulation results show that
the AirFC system realized by the RIS-aided MIMO configuration achieves
satisfactory classification accuracy.

Conclusion: 建立了首个鲁棒的植入子图检测框架，为半随机模型和计算-统计权衡研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

Abstract: This paper studies the sequence reconstruction problem for a channel inspired
by protein identification. We introduce a coloring channel, where a sequence is
transmitted through a channel that deletes all symbols not belonging to a fixed
subset (the coloring) of the alphabet. By extending this to a coloring profile,
a tuple of distinct colorings, we analyze the channel's information rate and
capacity. We prove that optimal (i.e., achieving maximum information rate)
coloring profiles correspond to 2-covering designs and identify the minimal
covering number required for maximum information rate, as well as the minimum
number for which any coloring profile is optimal.

Motivation: 非GRS MDS码和NMDS码在通信、密码学和存储系统中有广泛应用，但现有研究存在空白，如哪些码是非GRS MDS码以及如何优化其解码性能。

Method: 通过分析TGRS和ETGRS码，解决了两个问题：1）确定非GRS MDS码的类别；2）提出一种优于现有算法的ETGRS码解码算法。

Result: 1）发现两类非GRS MDS Hermitian自对偶TGRS码，并证明不存在Galois自对偶ETGRS码；2）提出一种ETGRS码的显式解码算法。

Conclusion: 研究填补了非GRS MDS码和NMDS码的空白，为实际应用提供了理论支持和解码优化方案。

Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that are not equivalent to generalized
Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are called non-GRS MDS codes. Alongside near MDS
(NMDS) codes, they are applicable in communication, cryptography, and storage
systems. From theoretical perspective, it is particularly intriguing to
investigate families of linear codes in which each element can be determined to
be either a non-GRS MDS or an NMDS code. Two promising candidates for such
families emerge from what is known as twisted GRS (TGRS) construction. These
candidates are the $(+)$-TGRS codes and their extended versions, called
$(+)$-extended TGRS (ETGRS) codes.
  Although many of their properties have been characterized, there are gaps to
fill. Which among the codes are non-GRS MDS? Can we improve on their decoding
by using their error-correcting pairs or deep holes? In this paper we solve
these problems. The answer to the first problem leads us to two classes of
non-GRS MDS Hermitian self-dual TGRS codes and a proof that there is no Galois
self-dual ETGRS code. Addressing the second problem, we present an explicit
decoding algorithm for ETGRS codes that outperforms existing decoding
algorithms given some conditions. By considering the duals of TGRS codes which
are MDS, we determine the covering radius and a class of deep holes of the
recently constructed non-GRS MDS codes due to Han and Zhang.

Motivation: 现代电信系统能够通过无线电环境定位用户和物体，引发了隐私问题。信号混淆是一种保护隐私的方法，但仅对单天线接收器有效。

Method: 提出了一种针对多天线接收器的CSI恢复方法，通过提取信道特征确保可靠的用户定位。

Result: 通过实际信道测量评估了信号混淆和恢复方法对定位性能的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了进一步保护用户位置隐私的必要性。

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

Motivation: 研究如何在集群化网络中保持节点信息尽可能新鲜，以提升网络效率。

Method: 引入RC-Gossip机制，根据网络中新鲜节点的数量动态调整传播速率，并使用基于更新奖励的方法分析新鲜度。

Result: RC-Gossip显著提高了不同集群网络中节点的信息新鲜度，并确定了最优集群大小。

Conclusion: RC-Gossip机制优于传统传播方法，能有效提升网络信息新鲜度。

Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its
information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through
clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as
fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we
assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart
mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip
(RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that
need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number
of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System
(SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we
present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based
approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness
of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared
to traditional gossiping techniques.

Main category: cs.DS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代键值存储依赖LSM树优化写入性能，但导致读取放大问题。传统辅助结构（如Bloom过滤器）内存开销大，学习模型提供数据自适应替代方案。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）分类器选择性跳过Bloom过滤器检查以减少查询延迟；2）用学习模型和小型备份过滤器替代传统Bloom过滤器以减少内存占用。

Result: 实验表明，分类器方法减少30%的Bloom过滤器检查，降低查询延迟2.28倍；学习模型方法减少70-80%内存占用且保持零假阴性。

Conclusion: 两种方法在延迟、内存和正确性间提供互补权衡，展示了学习模型在写入优化存储系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for
write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.
Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that
scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data
structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these
components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this
work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the
LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom
filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query
latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned
models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without
compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style
LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic
workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up
to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,
though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design
achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory
usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary
trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the
potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在解决DAR问题上具有理论和实践优势，适用于大规模高维数据。

Abstract: We study the problem of Direct-Access Ranked Retrieval (DAR) for interactive
data tooling, where evolving data exploration practices, combined with
large-scale and high-dimensional datasets, create new challenges. DAR concerns
the problem of enabling efficient access to arbitrary rank positions according
to a ranking function, without enumerating all preceding tuples. To address
this need, we formalize the DAR problem and propose a theoretically efficient
algorithm based on geometric arrangements, achieving logarithmic query time.
However, this method suffers from exponential space complexity in high
dimensions. Therefore, we develop a second class of algorithms based on
$\varepsilon$-sampling, which consume a linear space. Since exactly locating
the tuple at a specific rank is challenging due to its connection to the range
counting problem, we introduce a relaxed variant called Conformal Set Ranked
Retrieval (CSR), which returns a small subset guaranteed to contain the target
tuple. To solve the CSR problem efficiently, we define an intermediate problem,
Stripe Range Retrieval (SRR), and design a hierarchical sampling data structure
tailored for narrow-range queries. Our method achieves practical scalability in
both data size and dimensionality. We prove near-optimal bounds on the
efficiency of our algorithms and validate their performance through extensive
experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating scalability to
millions of tuples and hundreds of dimensions.

Result: 新算法达到了已知下界（对数因子内），解决了现有上下界之间的差距问题。

Conclusion: 该算法在理论上填补了PageRank局部估计的复杂性差距，为相关研究提供了新的工具。

Abstract: We study the computational complexity of locally estimating a node's PageRank
centrality in a directed graph $G$. For any node $t$, its PageRank centrality
$\pi(t)$ is defined as the probability that a random walk in $G$, starting from
a uniformly chosen node, terminates at $t$, where each step terminates with a
constant probability $\alpha\in(0,1)$.
  To obtain a multiplicative $\big(1\pm O(1)\big)$-approximation of $\pi(t)$
with probability $\Omega(1)$, the previously best upper bound is
$O(n^{1/2}\min\{ \Delta_{in}^{1/2},\Delta_{out}^{1/2},m^{1/4}\})$ from [Wang,
Wei, Wen, Yang STOC '24], where $n$ and $m$ denote the number of nodes and
edges in $G$, and $\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ upper bound the in-degrees
and out-degrees of $G$, respectively. The same paper implicitly gives the
previously best lower bound of
$\Omega(n^{1/2}\min\{\Delta_{in}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},\Delta_{out}^{1/2}/n^{\gamma},m^{1/4}\})$,
where $\gamma=\frac{\log(1/(1-\alpha))}{4\log\Delta_{in}-2\log(1/(1-\alpha))}$
if $\Delta_{in}>1/(1-\alpha)$, and $\gamma=1/2$ if
$\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$. As $\gamma$ only depends on $\Delta_{in}$, the
known upper bound is tight if we only parameterize the complexity by $n$, $m$,
and $\Delta_{out}$. However, there remains a gap of $\Omega(n^{\gamma})$ when
considering $\Delta_{in}$, and this gap is large when $\Delta_{in}$ is small.
In the extreme case where $\Delta_{in}\le1/(1-\alpha)$, we have $\gamma=1/2$,
leading to a gap of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ between the bounds $O(n^{1/2})$ and
$\Omega(1)$.
  In this paper, we present a new algorithm that achieves the above lower bound
(up to logarithmic factors). The algorithm assumes that $n$ and the bounds
$\Delta_{in}$ and $\Delta_{out}$ are known in advance. Our key technique is a
novel randomized backwards propagation process which only propagates
selectively based on Monte Carlo estimated PageRank scores.

Conclusion: 该算法是超越现有快速矩阵乘法算法的重要一步，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental kernel in high performance computing.
Many algorithms for fast matrix multiplication can only be applied to enormous
matrices ($n>10^{100}$) and thus cannot be used in practice. Of all algorithms
applicable to feasible input, Pan's $O(n^{2.773372})$ algorithm (1982) is
asymptotically the fastest. We obtain an $O(n^{2.773203})$ algorithm applicable
to the same input sizes as Pan's algorithm. This algorithm is the fastest
matrix multiplication algorithm with base case smaller than $1000$. Further,
our method obtains the best asymptotic complexity for many small base cases,
starting at $n_0=28$. We also obtain better exponents for larger base cases. To
construct our algorithm, we use the trilinear aggregation method. We find parts
of the algorithms that are equivalent to matrix multiplication with smaller
base case, and use the de Groote equivalence to replace these parts in a way
that allows further optimization of our algorithms. Finally, we improve the
additive complexity of our algorithms by finding a sparse decomposition and
reducing the leading coefficient. These mark a fundamental step towards
outperforming existing fast matrix multiplication algorithms in practice.

Motivation: 传统稀疏向量技术（SVT）在图算法中因组合导致误差放大，限制了其在图问题中的应用。论文旨在解决这一问题，并提出更高效的私有化方法。

Method: 提出了一种称为多维AboveThreshold（MAT）机制的新方法，将SVT从单维扩展到多维，并应用于多种图问题（如k-core分解、稠密子图等）。

Result: 实现了k-core分解的紧局部边DP算法，具有O(ε⁻¹log n)加性误差和无乘性误差；还提出了新的(2+η)因子乘性误差算法。

Conclusion: MAT机制显著提升了图问题的私有化算法性能，为k-core分解等问题提供了紧边界的新算法。

Abstract: Many differentially private and classical non-private graph algorithms rely
crucially on determining whether some property of each vertex meets a
threshold. For example, for the $k$-core decomposition problem, the classic
peeling algorithm iteratively removes a vertex if its induced degree falls
below a threshold. The sparse vector technique (SVT) is generally used to
transform non-private threshold queries into private ones with only a small
additive loss in accuracy. However, a naive application of SVT in the graph
setting leads to an amplification of the error by a factor of $n$ due to
composition, as SVT is applied to every vertex. In this paper, we resolve this
problem by formulating a novel generalized sparse vector technique which we
call the Multidimensional AboveThreshold (MAT) Mechanism which generalizes SVT
(applied to vectors with one dimension) to vectors with multiple dimensions. As
an application, we solve a number of important graph problems with better
bounds than previous work.
  We apply our MAT mechanism to obtain a set of improved bounds for a variety
of problems including $k$-core decomposition, densest subgraph, low out-degree
ordering, and vertex coloring. We give a tight local edge DP algorithm for
$k$-core decomposition with $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error and no
multiplicative error in $O(n)$ rounds. We also give a new $(2+\eta)$-factor
multiplicative, $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ additive error algorithm in $O(\log^2
n)$ rounds for any constant $\eta > 0$. Both of these results are
asymptotically tight against our new lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ for any
constant-factor approximation algorithm for $k$-core decomposition. Our new
algorithms for $k$-core also directly lead to new algorithms for densest
subgraph and low out-degree ordering. Our novel private defective coloring
algorithms uses number of colors proportional to the arboricity of the graph.

Abstract: A cover (or quasiperiod) of a string $S$ is a shorter string $C$ such that
every position of $S$ is contained in some occurrence of $C$ as a substring.
The notion of covers was introduced by Apostolico and Ehrenfeucht over 30 years
ago [Theor. Comput. Sci. 1993] and it has received significant attention from
the combinatorial pattern matching community. In this note, we show how to
efficiently test whether $S$ admits a cover. Our tester can also be translated
into a streaming algorithm.

Abstract: Classical clustering problems such as \emph{Facility Location} and
\emph{$k$-Median} aim to efficiently serve a set of clients from a subset of
facilities -- minimizing the total cost of facility openings and client
assignments in Facility Location, and minimizing assignment (service) cost
under a facility count constraint in $k$-Median. These problems are highly
sensitive to outliers, and therefore researchers have studied variants that
allow excluding a small number of clients as outliers to reduce cost. However,
in many real-world settings, clients belong to different demographic or
functional groups, and unconstrained outlier removal can disproportionately
exclude certain groups, raising fairness concerns.
  We study \emph{Facility Location with Fair Outliers}, where each group is
allowed a specified number of outliers, and the objective is to minimize total
cost while respecting group-wise fairness constraints. We present a bicriteria
approximation with a $O(1/\epsilon)$ approximation factor and $(1+ 2\epsilon)$
factor violation in outliers per group. For \emph{$k$-Median with Fair
Outliers}, we design a bicriteria approximation with a $4(1+\omega/\epsilon)$
approximation factor and $(\omega + \epsilon)$ violation in outliers per group
improving on prior work by avoiding dependence on $k$ in outlier violations. We
also prove that the problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by $\omega$, assuming
the Exponential Time Hypothesis.
  We complement our algorithmic contributions with a detailed empirical
analysis, demonstrating that fairness can be achieved with negligible increase
in cost and that the integrality gap of the standard LP is small in practice.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的均匀性跟踪问题，解决了传统均匀性测试的局限性，并提出了一个竞争性算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀性测试问题无法捕捉许多实际场景，且其基于预设距离的定义可能导致性能不佳。

Method: 引入均匀性跟踪问题，利用泊松混合的新结构结果，设计了一个竞争性算法。

Result: 提出了一个$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive的均匀性跟踪算法。

Conclusion: 均匀性跟踪问题更具实用性，新算法在性能上具有竞争力。

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an
unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide
whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total
variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This
question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,
by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of
interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a
prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity
tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity
(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be
competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in
hindsight. Our main contribution is a
$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking
algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on
Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

### [325] [DBAIOps: A Reasoning LLM-Enhanced Database Operation and Maintenance System using Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01136)
*Wei Zhou,Peng Sun,Xuanhe Zhou,Qianglei Zang,Ji Xu,Tieying Zhang,Guoliang Li,Fan Wu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DBAIOps是一种新型混合数据库运维系统，结合推理LLM和知识图谱，实现了DBA风格的诊断，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动数据库运维方法无法有效利用专家经验，规则方法仅支持基本任务，LLM方法生成结果不准确。

Method: DBAIOps采用异构图模型表示诊断经验，半自动构建算法从文档中构建图谱，开发800+可复用异常模型，两阶段图演化机制探索诊断路径，推理LLM推断根因。

Result: 在四种主流数据库系统中，DBAIOps在根因和人工评估准确率上分别比基线高34.85%和47.22%。

Conclusion: DBAIOps通过结合知识图谱和推理LLM，显著提升了数据库运维的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统性基准测试框架，评估了四种检索范式及其组合和重排序策略，揭示了混合搜索架构中的关键现象和优化方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统（如RAG）需要混合搜索，但其架构设计复杂且缺乏系统性实证研究，因此本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过构建开源数据库Infinity，评估了四种检索范式（FTS、SVS、DVS、TenS）及其组合和重排序策略，在11个真实数据集上进行测试。

Result: 发现三个关键现象：1）"最弱环节"现象；2）性能权衡的数据驱动图；3）TRF作为高效替代方案。

Conclusion: 为下一代混合搜索系统设计提供了具体指南，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Hybrid search, the integration of lexical and semantic retrieval, has become
a cornerstone of modern information retrieval systems, driven by demanding
applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The architectural
design space for these systems is vast and complex, yet a systematic, empirical
understanding of the trade-offs among their core components--retrieval
paradigms, combination schemes, and re-ranking methods--is critically lacking.
To address this, and informed by our experience building the Infinity
open-source database, we present the first systematic benchmark of advanced
hybrid search architectures. Our framework evaluates four retrieval
paradigms--Full-Text Search (FTS), Sparse Vector Search (SVS), Dense Vector
Search (DVS), and Tensor Search (TenS)--benchmarking their combinations and
re-ranking strategies across 11 real-world datasets. Our results reveal three
key findings for practitioners and researchers: (1) A "weakest link"
phenomenon, where a single underperforming retrieval path can
disproportionately degrade overall accuracy, highlighting the need for
path-wise quality assessment before fusion. (2) A data-driven map of the
performance trade-offs, demonstrating that optimal configurations depend
heavily on resource constraints and data characteristics, moving beyond a
one-size-fits-all approach. (3) The identification of Tensor-based Re-ranking
Fusion (TRF) as a high-efficacy alternative to mainstream fusion methods,
offering the semantic power of tensor search at a fraction of the computational
and memory cost. Our findings offer concrete guidelines for designing the next
generation of adaptive, scalable hybrid search systems while also identifying
key directions for future research.

*Wenjie Hu,Guanzhou Hu,Mahesh Balakrishnan,Xiangyao Yu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出Marlin，一种云原生协调机制，通过解耦集群协调功能，解决了传统集中式协调服务的扩展性和成本效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代云数据库已从集中式架构转向存储解耦，但控制平面仍依赖外部集中式协调服务（如ZooKeeper），导致扩展性瓶颈和成本效率低下。

Method: Marlin将协调功能整合到云原生数据库中，支持跨节点修改协调状态，并通过事务和优化的提交协议（MarlinCommit）确保数据一致性。

Result: 评估显示，Marlin比集中式协调方案成本效率提升4.4倍，重新配置时间减少4.9倍。

Conclusion: 解耦集群协调功能可显著提升云数据库的扩展性和成本效率，Marlin为此提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern cloud databases are shifting from converged architectures to storage
disaggregation, enabling independent scaling and billing of compute and
storage. However, cloud databases still rely on external, converged
coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper) for their control planes. These
services are effectively lightweight databases optimized for low-volume
metadata. As the control plane scales in the cloud, this approach faces similar
limitations as converged databases did before storage disaggregation:
scalability bottlenecks, low cost efficiency, and increased operational burden.
  We propose to disaggregate the cluster coordination to achieve the same
benefits that storage disaggregation brought to modern cloud DBMSs. We present
Marlin, a cloud-native coordination mechanism that fully embraces storage
disaggregation. Marlin eliminates the need for external coordination services
by consolidating coordination functionality into the existing cloud-native
database it manages. To achieve failover without an external coordination
service, Marlin allows cross-node modifications on coordination states. To
ensure data consistency, Marlin employs transactions to manage both
coordination and application states and introduces MarlinCommit, an optimized
commit protocol that ensures strong transactional guarantees even under
cross-node modifications. Our evaluations demonstrate that Marlin improves cost
efficiency by up to 4.4x and reduces reconfiguration duration by up to 4.9x
compared to converged coordination solutions.

*Francesco Gargiulo,Rossano Venturini*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: OnPair是一种字典压缩算法，针对内存数据库需求设计，平衡高压缩比与快速随机访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如BPE和FSST）在压缩比与速度之间存在权衡，OnPair旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用缓存友好的字典构建技术，增量合并频繁相邻子串，支持快速、高效训练；OnPair16变体限制字典条目为16字节，优化最长前缀匹配。

Result: 实验显示OnPair和OnPair16压缩比接近BPE，同时显著提升速度和内存效率。

Conclusion: OnPair成功平衡了压缩比与性能，适用于内存数据库系统。

Abstract: We present OnPair, a dictionary-based compression algorithm designed to meet
the needs of in-memory database systems that require both high compression and
fast random access. Existing methods either achieve strong compression ratios
at significant computational and memory cost (e.g., BPE) or prioritize speed at
the expense of compression quality (e.g., FSST). OnPair bridges this gap by
employing a cache-friendly dictionary construction technique that incrementally
merges frequent adjacent substrings in a single sequential pass over a data
sample. This enables fast, memory-efficient training without tracking global
pair positions, as required by traditional BPE. We also introduce OnPair16, a
variant that limits dictionary entries to 16 bytes, enabling faster parsing via
optimized longest prefix matching. Both variants compress strings
independently, supporting fine-grained random access without block-level
overhead. Experiments on real-world datasets show that OnPair and OnPair16
achieve compression ratios comparable to BPE while significantly improving
compression speed and memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在心理推理任务中表现不足，缺乏理论对齐的监督和捕捉现实世界叙事中微妙心理过程的能力。

Method: 利用专家标注的心理场景，结合轨迹感知强化学习框架，模仿专家心理思维模式，整合现实刺激与结构化推理指导。

Result: 模型在多个基准测试中表现出专家级的解释能力，具备强大的分布外泛化和持续学习能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了模型在心理推理任务中的表现，支持持续自我改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models show promise in emotion understanding, social
reasoning, and empathy, yet they struggle with psychologically grounded tasks
that require inferring implicit mental states in context-rich, ambiguous
settings. These limitations arise from the absence of theory-aligned
supervision and the difficulty of capturing nuanced mental processes in
real-world narratives. To address this gap, we leverage expert-labeled,
psychologically rich scenarios and propose a trajectory-aware reinforcement
learning framework that explicitly imitates expert psychological thought
patterns. By integrating real-world stimuli with structured reasoning guidance,
our approach enables compact models to internalize social-cognitive principles,
perform nuanced psychological inference, and support continual
self-improvement. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks further
demonstrate that our models achieve expert-level interpretive capabilities,
exhibiting strong out-of-distribution generalization and robust continual
learning across diverse, challenging, and psychologically grounded tasks.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: M2是一种多模型分析系统，通过集成存储引擎和跨模型查询优化，显著提升了多模型数据分析的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据分析任务需要同时处理多种数据模型，现有方法如多语言持久化和多模型数据库系统存在通信成本高或存储引擎单一的问题。

Method: M2采用集成存储引擎，将多模型数据视为一等公民，并设计了一种多阶段哈希连接算法以高效结合不同模型的数据。

Result: 实验表明，M2在多模型分析任务上比现有方法快188倍。

Conclusion: M2通过创新设计和算法，有效解决了多模型数据分析的挑战。

Abstract: Modern data analytic workloads increasingly require handling multiple data
models simultaneously. Two primary approaches meet this need: polyglot
persistence and multi-model database systems. Polyglot persistence employs a
coordinator program to manage several independent database systems but suffers
from high communication costs due to its physically disaggregated architecture.
Meanwhile, existing multi-model database systems rely on a single storage
engine optimized for a specific data model, resulting in inefficient processing
across diverse data models. To address these limitations, we present M2, a
multi-model analytic system with integrated storage engines. M2 treats all data
models as first-class entities, composing query plans that incorporate
operations across models. To effectively combine data from different models,
the system introduces a specialized inter-model join algorithm called
multi-stage hash join. Our evaluation demonstrates that M2 outperforms existing
approaches by up to 188x speedup on multi-model analytics, confirming the
effectiveness of our proposed techniques.
