A principal issue in the algorithmic aspects of popular matchings\nis how to determine the popularity of a matching, because it requires\nexponential time if the definition is simply applied.

Typically, proportionality is captured\nby variants of the Justified Representation axiom, which say that cohesive\ngroups of at least $\\ell\\cdot\\frac{n}{k}$ voters (where $n$ is the total number\nof voters and $k$ is the desired number of winners) deserve $\\ell$\nrepresentatives. The quantity $\\frac{n}{k}$ is known as the Hare quota in the\nsocial choice literature. Another -- more demanding -- choice of quota is the\nDroop quota, defined as $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{k+1}\\rfloor+1$. This quota is often\nused in multiwinner voting with ranked ballots: in algorithms such as Single\nTransferable Voting, and in proportionality axioms, such as Droop's\nProportionality Criterion. A few authors have considered it in the context of\napproval ballots, but the existing analysis is far from comprehensive. The\ncontribution of our work is a systematic study of JR-style axioms (and voting\nrules that satisfy them) defined using the Droop quota instead of the Hare\nquota. For each of the standard JR axioms (namely, JR, PJR, EJR, FPJR, FJR,\nPJR+ and EJR+), we identify a voting rule that satisfies the Droop version of\nthis axiom. In some cases, it suffices to consider known rules (modifying the\ncorresponding Hare proof, sometimes quite substantially), and in other cases it\nis necessary to modify the rules from prior work. Each axiom is more difficult\nto satisfy when defined using the Droop quota, so our results expand the\nfrontier of satisfiable proportionality axioms.

We evaluate the resulting models on\nclassification accuracy, robustness to weight perturbations and input\ndegradation, and the spatial organization of learned representations.

Moreover, optimal\nbounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings,\nwhere no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the\nproblem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic\nperspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users,\neach holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who\naim to securely compute the sum of all inputs.

First two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have opened up greater\nopportunities to enable fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to behave as\nmore powerful interactive agents through improved instruction-following\nability. However, understanding how this impacts confidence calibration for\nreliable model output has not been researched in full. In this work, we examine\nvarious open-sourced LLMs, identifying significant calibration degradation\nafter instruction tuning in each. Seeking a practical solution, we look towards\nlabel smoothing, which has been shown as an effective method to regularize for\noverconfident predictions but has yet to be widely adopted in the supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs. We first provide insight as to why label smoothing\nis sufficient to maintain calibration throughout the SFT process. However,\nsettings remain where the effectiveness of smoothing is severely diminished, in\nparticular the case of large vocabulary LLMs (LV-LLMs). We posit the cause to\nstem from the ability to become over-confident, which has a direct relationship\nwith the hidden size and vocabulary size, and justify this theoretically and\nexperimentally. Finally, we address an outstanding issue regarding the memory\nfootprint of the cross-entropy loss computation in the label smoothed loss\nsetting, designing a customized kernel to dramatically reduce memory\nconsumption without sacrificing speed or performance in comparison to existing\nsolutions for non-smoothed losses."}

But, similarly to other forms,\ntabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious\nperformance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the\nmost effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks\n(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the\nunder-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed\nGAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the\nreal data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,\nthe class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical\nvariables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less\neffective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a\nconditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,\nctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input\nsamples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a\nnovel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes\nboth cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to\ngenerate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data\ndistribution.

To address this challenge, we propose Nested Graph Pseudo-Label\nRefinement (NeGPR), a novel framework tailored for graph-level domain\nadaptation with noisy labels. NeGPR first pretrains dual branches, i.e.,\nsemantic and topology branches, by enforcing neighborhood consistency in the\nfeature space, thereby reducing the influence of noisy supervision. To bridge\ndomain gaps, NeGPR employs a nested refinement mechanism in which one branch\nselects high-confidence target samples to guide the adaptation of the other,\nenabling progressive cross-domain learning. Furthermore, since pseudo-labels\nmay still contain noise and the pre-trained branches are already overfitted to\nthe noisy labels in the source domain, NeGPR incorporates a noise-aware\nregularization strategy. This regularization is theoretically proven to\nmitigate the adverse effects of pseudo-label noise, even under the presence of\nsource overfitting, thus enhancing the robustness of the adaptation process.\nExtensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeGPR consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods under severe label noise, achieving gains\nof up to 12.7% in accuracy."}

Denoising autoencoders\nrely on fixed-magnitude noise, limiting adaptability to diverse data\ndistributions. Diffusion models introduce scheduled noise and iterative\ndenoising, but lack explicit reconstruction mappings. We propose the\nDiffusion-Scheduled Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), a framework that integrates\ndiffusion-based noise scheduling and contrastive learning into the encoding\nprocess to improve anomaly detection. We evaluated DDAE on 57 datasets from\nADBench. Our method outperforms in semi-supervised settings and achieves\ncompetitive results in unsupervised settings, improving PR-AUC by up to 65%\n(9%) and ROC-AUC by 16% (6%) over state-of-the-art autoencoder (diffusion)\nmodel baselines.

The quantum circuit\nconsists of an encoding layer, which loads data into the circuit, and a\ntemplate circuit, known as the ansatz, responsible for processing the data.\nThis work involves performing an analysis by considering both Amplitude- and\nAngle-encoding models, and examining how the type of rotational gate applied\naffects the classification performance of the model. This comparison is carried\nout by training the different models on two datasets, Wine and Diabetes, and\nevaluating their performance. The study demonstrates that, under identical\nmodel topologies, the difference in accuracy between the best and worst models\nranges from 10% to 30%, with differences reaching up to 41%.

Using a principled, partially\naxiomatic approach, we design a parametrizable and decomposable objective\nfunction that represents an inequality- and risk-averse long-term aggregate of\nhuman power.

Granger\ncausality is one of the well-known techniques for inferring causality in time\nseries.

While recent work on variable-lag Granger causality (VLGC) addresses\nthis limitation by allowing a cause to influence an effect with different time\nlags at each time point, it fails to account for the fact that causal\ninteractions may vary not only in time delay but also across frequency bands.\nFor example, in brain signals, alpha-band activity may influence another region\nwith a shorter delay than slower delta-band oscillations.
