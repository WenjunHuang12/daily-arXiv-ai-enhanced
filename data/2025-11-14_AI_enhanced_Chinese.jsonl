While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs)\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u79fb\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62bd\u8c61\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u8c61\u53cd\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79fb\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaM-AODBs\u5e73\u53f0Dolphin\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eMicrosoft Orleans\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cDolphin\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79fb\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62bd\u8c61\u548cM-AODBs\u5e73\u53f0\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u907f\u514d\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7ea7\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Much of the research has concentrated on fairness, with comparatively less attention given to other important aspects. Chen et al. (2010) introduced an algorithm that, in addition to ensuring fairness, was strategyproof -- meaning agents had no incentive to misreport their valuations. However, even in the absence of strategic incentives to misreport, agents may still hesitate to reveal their true preferences due to privacy concerns (e.g., when allocating advertising time between firms, revealing preferences could inadvertently expose planned marketing strategies or product launch timelines). In this work, we extend the strategyproof algorithm of Chen et al. by introducing a privacy-preserving dimension. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first private cake-cutting protocol, and, in addition, this protocol is also envy-free and strategyproof. Our approach replaces the algorithm's centralized computation with a novel adaptation of cryptographic techniques, enabling privacy without compromising fairness or strategyproofness. Thus, our protocol encourages agents to report their true preferences not only because they are not incentivized to lie, but also because they are protected from having their preferences exposed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u86cb\u7cd5\u5207\u5272\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u7684\u504f\u597d\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u86cb\u7cd5\u5207\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u987e\u8651\u4e0d\u613f\u900f\u9732\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\uff08\u5982\u5546\u4e1a\u7ade\u4e89\u4e2d\u7684\u8425\u9500\u7b56\u7565\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5728Chen\u7b49\u4eba\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u7528\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u66ff\u4ee3\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6216\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u65e0\u5ac9\u5992\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u7684\u86cb\u7cd5\u5207\u5272\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\u8bf4\u8c0e\u7684\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u5176\u504f\u597d\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9f13\u52b1\u771f\u5b9e\u504f\u597d\u62a5\u544a\u3002"}}

However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization.

Through the discovery of significant spatial diversity within a compact antenna space, FASs enable the implementation of reconfigurable-antenna-based architectures. However, current state-of-the-art studies rarely investigate the impact of finite blocklength constraints on FAS-based designs, leaving a gap in both analytical modeling and the establishment of a solid, universally applicable performance metric for finite blocklength fluid antenna systems (FBL-FAS). In this work, we focus on the study of FBL-FAS and, more importantly, derive a block error rate (BLER) bound that serves as a general and practical performance benchmark across various FAS architectures.

We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile.

With $n$ symmetric agents, a natural benchmark for each agent is the utility realized by her favorite $1/n$-fraction of rounds; a line of work has demonstrated one can robustly guarantee each agent a constant fraction of this ideal utility, irrespective of how other agents behave. In particular, several mechanisms have been shown to be $1/2$-robust, and recent work established that repeated first-price auctions based on artificial credits have a robustness factor of $0.59$, which cannot be improved beyond $0.6$ using first-price and simple strategies. In contrast, even without strategic considerations, the best achievable factor is $1-1/e\\approx 0.63$.\n  In this work, we break the $0.6$ first-price barrier to get a new $0.625$-robust mechanism, which almost closes the gap to the non-strategic robustness bound. Surprisingly, we do so via a simple auction, where in each round, bidders decide if they ask for the item, and we allocate uniformly at random among those who ask. The main new ingredient is the idea of competitive subsidies, wherein we charge the winning agent an amount in artificial credits that decreases when fewer agents are bidding (specifically, when $k$ agents bid, then the winner pays proportional to $k/(k+1)$, varying the payment by a factor of 2 depending on the competition). Moreover, we show how it can be modified to get an equilibrium strategy with a slightly weaker robust guarantee of $5/(3e) \\approx 0.61$ (and the optimal $1-1/e$ factor at equilibrium).

To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.\n  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests).

In real-world scenarios, however, the presence of missing modalities and noisy signals significantly hinders the robustness and accuracy of existing models.

To jointly mitigate the challenges posed by missing and noisy modalities, we propose a framework called Two-stage Modality Denoising and Complementation (TMDC). TMDC comprises two sequential training stages. In the Intra-Modality Denoising Stage, denoised modality-specific and modality-shared representations are extracted from complete data using dedicated denoising modules, reducing the impact of noise and enhancing representational robustness. In the Inter-Modality Complementation Stage, these representations are leveraged to compensate for missing modalities, thereby enriching the available information and further improving robustness.

We depart from Uncapacitated Facility Location and by assuming that the connection costs of agents to facilities are congestion dependent, we define a novel problem, namely, Facility Location for Congesting (Selfish) Commuters. The connection costs of agents to facilities come as a result of how the agents commute to reach the facilities in an underlying network with cost functions on the edges.

But unfortunately, no fast algorithms are currently known for exact max-flow in several standard models of computation, such as the cut-query model and the fully-dynamic model.\n  Our main technical contribution is a sparsifier that preserves all minimum $s,t$-cuts in an unweighted graph, and can be constructed using only approximate max-flow computations. We then use this sparsifier to devise new algorithms for APMC in unweighted graphs in several computational models: (i) a randomized algorithm that makes $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ cut queries to the input graph; (ii) a deterministic fully-dynamic algorithm with $n^{3/2+o(1)}$ worst-case update time; and (iii) a randomized two-pass streaming algorithm with space requirement $\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$.

Here we consider a generalization of the well-known \\textsc{Cluster Deletion} problem, named \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion}. The task is to compute the minimum number of hedges of a hedge graph so that their removal results in a graph that is isomorphic to a disjoint union of cliques. We show that for graphs that contain bounded size of vertex-disjoint 3-vertex-paths as subgraphs, \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} can be solved in polynomial time. Regarding its approximability, we prove that the problem is tightly connected to the related complexity of the \\textsc{Min Horn Deletion} problem, a well-known boolean CSP problem. Our connection shows that it is NP-hard to approximate \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} within factor $2^{O(\\log^{1-\u03b5} r)}$ for any $\u03b5>0$, where $r$ is the number of hedges in a given hedge graph.\n  Based on its classified (in)approximability and the difficulty imposed by the structure of almost all non-trivial graphs, we consider the hedge underlying structure. We give a polynomial-time algorithm with constant approximation ratio for \\textsc{Hedge Cluster Deletion} whenever each triangle of the input graph is covered by at most two hedges. On the way to this result, an interesting ingredient that we solved efficiently is a variant of the \\textsc{Vertex Cover} problem in which apart from the desired vertex set that covers the edge set, a given set of vertex-constraints should also be included in the solution. Moreover, as a possible workaround for the existence of efficient exact algorithms, we propose the hedge intersection graph which is the intersection graph spanned by the hedges.

That is, we prove that for any class C with bounded expansion and any graph H, testing H-freeness can be done with constant query complexity on any graph G in C, where the constant depends on H and C, but is independent of G.\n  While classes excluding a minor are prime examples of classes with bounded expansion, so are, for example, cubic graphs, graph classes with bounded maximum degree, graphs of bounded book thickness, or random graphs of bounded average degree.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5H-\u65e0\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u5e38\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7a20\u5bc6\u56fe\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5df2\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7279\u5f81\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3002Czumaj\u548cSohler\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u548c\u6392\u9664\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\u4e2dH-\u65e0\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5e38\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9bH-\u65e0\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u5e38\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5e38\u6570\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eH\u548c\u56fe\u7c7bC\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u7c7bC\u548c\u4efb\u4f55\u56feH\uff0c\u5728C\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u56feG\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5H-\u65e0\u6027\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u5e38\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u8be5\u5e38\u6570\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eH\u548cC\uff0c\u4e0eG\u65e0\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06H-\u65e0\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u56fe\u7c7b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6392\u9664\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u7c7b\u3001\u7acb\u65b9\u56fe\u3001\u6709\u754c\u6700\u5927\u5ea6\u56fe\u7c7b\u7b49\u3002"}}

To alleviate this challenge, one can leverage model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) solutions, however, conventional MBRL approaches rely on black-box models that are not interpretable and cannot reason. In contrast, in this paper, a novel causal model-based MARL framework is developed by leveraging tools from causal learn- ing. In particular, the proposed model can explicitly represent causal dependencies between network variables using structural causal models (SCMs) and attention-based inference networks. Interpretable causal models are then developed to capture how MAC control messages influence observations, how transmission actions determine outcomes, and how channel observations affect rewards. Data augmentation techniques are then used to generate synthetic rollouts using the learned causal model for policy optimization via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Analytical results demonstrate exponential sample complexity gains of causal MBRL over black-box approaches. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, on average, the proposed approach can reduce environment interactions by 58%, and yield faster convergence compared to model-free baselines. The proposed approach inherently is also shown to provide interpretable scheduling decisions via attention-based causal attribution, revealing which network conditions drive the policy.

However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u53476G ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u662f\u672a\u67656G ISAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4f20\u64ad\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u529f\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u56fa\u6709\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u6536\u53d1\u5668\u91cd\u6784\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u901a\u8fc7\u88ab\u52a8\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u4f5c\u4e3aISAC\u7528\u6237\u548c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7f51\u7edc\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MA-IRS\u652f\u6301\u7684ISAC\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8026\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5148\u8fdb\u4f4e\u7a7aISAC\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u4f1a\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002"}}
