People often combine multiple activities, such as dropping\nkids off at school, commuting to work, and grocery shopping, while seeking\nopportunities to meet others. To address this need, we propose a novel query\ntype, the Trip-based Group Nearest Neighbor (T-GNN) query, which identifies the\noptimal meetup Point of Interest (POI) that aligns with users' existing trips.\nAn individual trip consists of a sequence of locations, allowing users the\nflexibility to detour to the meetup POI at any location within the sequence,\nknown as a detour location. Given a set of trips for the users, the query\nidentifies the optimal meetup POI (e.g., restaurants or movie theaters) and\ndetour locations from each user's trip that minimize the total trip overhead\ndistance. The trip overhead distance refers to the additional distance a user\nmust travel to visit the meetup POI before returning to the next location in\ntheir trip. The sum of these overhead distances for all users constitutes the\ntotal trip overhead distance. The computation time for processing T-GNN queries\nincreases with the number of POIs. To address this, we introduce three\ntechniques to prune the POIs that cannot contribute to the optimal solution,\nand thus refine the search space. We also develop an efficient approach for\nprocessing T-GNN queries in real-time. Extensive experiments validate the\nperformance of the proposed algorithm."}

Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text\nmodality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues\nwhile neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal\nscenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or\nauditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the\nintrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio.

In this paper, we aim to explore\nthe fundamental limit of large-field-size RLSCs in stochastic symbol erasure\nchannels (SEC). The Non-systematic RLSCs (NRLSCs) in i.i.d. SEC has been\nanalyzed in [Pinwen Su et al. 2022]. In this work, we first derive the\nclosed-form expression on the exact error probability of NRLSCs in\nGilbert-Elliott symbol erasure channels (G-ESEC). Compared to i.i.d SEC, the\nerasure probability of G-ESEC depends on channel state, thus transitions\nbetween the states should be considered. To deal with the stochastic state\ntransitions, we introduce two novel techniques. (i) To account for the impact\nof switching states on probability terms, we find and leverage the recursive\nstructure of the state transition traces. (ii) To obtain the expected number of\nerror timeslots, we derive the stationary initial distribution of the states,\nand formulate iterative equation to characterize the expectation terms. Then we\nanalyze the Systematic RLSCs (SRLSCs) in a special SEC, i.e., the packet\nerasure channel (PEC). In this scenario, SRLSCs could save some source symbols\nwhich should have exceeded the decoding delay in NRLSCs, and thus could\nsignificantly reduce the error probability. To this point, our contributions\nare two-folds. (i) Through a case study, we find a counter-intuitive phenomenon\nthat SRLSCs can cause unexpected error events comparing to NRLSCs in some\nerasure patterns. Then we fully characterize the error event of SRLSCs for any\nerasure pattern. (ii) For i.i.d. PEC, we derive an analytical expression on\nexact error probability of SRLSCs when length of memory approaches infinity and\ncoding rate equals to 1/2.

Such multimodal data can be used\nto identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes,\nsuch as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural\ndisasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and\ndifficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for\nidentifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an\nincident, as well as understanding the different components which define an\nincident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the\ncauses of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and\nintensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create\nSIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal\nUrban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary\nworld knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in\nurban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize\nevidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and\nhuman-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents.

This thesis investigates\nprincipled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning\nsystems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints\nand non-differentiability.\n  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture\ndesign, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose\nnovel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying\ndiscrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based\ntraining of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These\napproximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations,\nleading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the\ncontext of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture\nsearch that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore\nimplicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization,\nrevisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an\nadaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.\n  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via\nscalable and principled approximations.

One is\nthat dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other\nis that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we\nstudy the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both\nthe long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge\nwith the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a\nmean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization\nand the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when\nthe risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the\nsecond challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V\noptimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We\niteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that\nis used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V\nproblems.

Both models\nare designed to learn permutation-equivariant high-degree polynomials over\ninput features, while remaining scalable with no added time complexity.\nExperiments on five benchmark heterophilic datasets show that our Poly model\nconsistently outperforms existing baselines, and that Dir-Poly offers\nadditional gains on graphs with inherent directionality (e.g., Roman Empire),\nachieving state-of-the-art results. Interestingly, on undirected graphs,\nintroducing artificial directionality does not always help, suggesting that the\nbenefit of directional message passing is context-dependent. Our findings\nhighlight the complementary roles of edge direction and expressive feature\nmodeling in heterophilic graph learning."}

While\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their\napplication has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within\nhuman-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open\nquestion. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver\nfor the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved\nfragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint\nscaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative\nself-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a\nviable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy\nprocess, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the\nscoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior\nwork may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of\nLLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed\ngreedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a\nhuman-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers,\nthough its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight\ntwo major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the\nengineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks,\nand the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search\nfor novel solutions."}

Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through\nattention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full\nTransformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods\nsuch as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while\nrouting fewer tokens to full attention.

This\nwork proposes a fine-tuned large brain model (LaBraM)-based correlation\nattention mapping method that leverages spatial channel relationships in IMU\ndata to identify motion-related artifacts in EEG signals. The fine-tuned model\ncontains approximately 9.2 million parameters and uses 5.9 hours of EEG and IMU\nrecordings for training, just 0.2346\\% of the 2500 hours used to train the base\nmodel. We compare our results against the established ASR-ICA benchmark across\nvarying time scales and motion activities, showing that incorporating IMU\nreference signals significantly improves robustness under diverse motion\nscenarios."}

However,\nas a growing number of finetuned models become publicly available, concerns\nabout the safety of model merging have emerged. Unauthorized merging may\ninfringe on developers' rights and risk leaking sensitive personal information.\nMost existing methods focus on detecting whether a merged model originates from\na specific source model, but fail to effectively prevent illegal merging. In\nthis paper, we propose MergeLock, an active protection mechanism that disrupts\nmodel parameters to render them unmergeable, thereby directly preventing\nunauthorized model merging. Specifically, leveraging the inherent symmetry of\nthe attention mechanism in Transformer-based models, we randomly sample two\npairs of invertible matrices and apply them to the Query-Key (QK) and\nValue-Output (VO) branches. This transformation keeps the model's output\nunchanged while pushing it away from the shared parameter space of other\nfinetuned models. Extensive experiments across both vision and language tasks\ndemonstrate that MergeLock can degrade the performance of merged models by over\n95% when a protected model is involved in most cases, demonstrating its\neffectiveness. Moreover, we further demonstrate that merged models protected by\nMergeLock cannot be effectively recovered using low-cost restoration methods,\nfurther enhancing robustness against unauthorized merging.

In response, machine learning-based approaches have\nrecently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods\nsuch as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many\nrecent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more\nadvanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical\nsuccess index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective\nduring extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold,\nrendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a\nquadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation.

For unsupervised identification, an\nunsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated\nto detect novel patterns.

First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing\ncode for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient\nupdates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration\nactions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed\nasynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions.

To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data\nperturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly\nutilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and\ndiversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data\nutility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation\nand data utility remains a critical challenge.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework\nfor the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on\ndata utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the\nupper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that\nperturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining\nfidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs\nlocal extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of\nindividual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted\nprivacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our\nmethod effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are\nvulnerable to MIA.

Our approach offers a practical\nalternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling\nthe LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We\nevaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large\nmodels, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost.\nThe results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that\nstructured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our\nfindings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective\nand scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs."}

To\naddress these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier\ndesigned to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating\ndiverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from\nConjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems\nalong three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question\nformat, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer\nverification via PySAT.

Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using\nSATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning,\nparticularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats.
