More\nprecisely, we show that every externality budget achievable by any feasible\nflow in the network can also be achieved as a Wardrop equilibrium by setting\nappropriate prices. For extremal and Pareto-minimal budgets, we show that there\nare prices such that all equilibria respect the budgets. Although the proofs of\nexistence of these particular prices rely on fixed-point arguments and are\nnon-constructive, we show that in the case where the equilibrium minimizes a\nconvex potential, the prices can be obtained as Lagrange multipliers of a\nsuitable convex program.

However, effectively exploiting\nmultimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to\nsubstantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation\nremain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal\nFusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential\nrecommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal\nFusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and\nis trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)\ncross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for\nrecommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and\npreventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional\nregularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item\nrepresentations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse\nAttention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences\nvia a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed\nattention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user\ninterests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models\nboth the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block\nvariations, producing robust user and item representations. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world benchmarks show that MUFASA consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, online A/B tests demonstrate significant\ngains in production, confirming MUFASA's effectiveness in leveraging multimodal\ncues and accurately capturing diverse user preferences."}

However, recent\nstudies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as\nattention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve\ncomparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits\nattributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other\narchitectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a\ncentral question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series\nanalysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that\nsystematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models\nwith dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any\nsequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This\nsubstitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical\nfoundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive\nexperiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven\nstate-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show\nthat replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even\nsuperior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer\nbenefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that \"deeper and more complex\narchitectures are inherently better\" in TSA."}

To test two hypotheses, we propose an\nensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and\nAttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory\nbulb LFPs.

Individuals can strategically adapt to the information gathered\nabout classifiers, which in turn may require algorithms to be re-trained.

Our\nframework provides a mathematically rigorous way of treating the problem of\nfeedback loops between collectives of users and institutions, allowing to test\ninterventions to mitigate the adverse effects of strategic adaptation. As a\ncase study, we consider institutions deploying algorithms for credit lending.\nWe consider several scenarios, each representing different interaction\nparadigms. When algorithms are not robust against strategic manipulation, we\nare able to capture previous challenges discussed in the strategic\nclassification literature, whereby users either pay excessive costs to meet the\ninstitutions' expectations (leading to high social costs) or game the algorithm\n(e.g., provide fake information). From this baseline setting, we test the role\nof improving gaming detection and providing algorithmic recourse. We show that\nincreased detection capabilities reduce social costs and could lead to users'\nimprovement; when perfect classifiers are not feasible (likely to occur in\npractice), algorithmic recourse can steer the dynamics towards high users'\nimprovement rates.

Traditional methods --\nstatistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution\nshifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high\nfalse positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal\nGraph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack\ndetection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised\nframework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal\ninvariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under \"Normal\"\nand \"Attack\" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs\nstructural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by\nevaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging\ncausal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in\nnon-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional\nmachine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile\nsensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher\nprecision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving\nresilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift.

While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can\nbe effective context-aided forecasters via na\\\"ive direct prompting, their full\npotential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,\nproviding new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.\nReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing\nus to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its\nforecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts\nwith context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting\npipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided\nforecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the\nlargest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to\nestimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger\nmodels. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from\nthe CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\\\"ive\nprompting across LLMs of different sizes and families.

However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during\nthe iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion\nalleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though\nat the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as\nRetrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning\ndenoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While\neffective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and\nretrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for\nsimilarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype\nDiffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly\ninto the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -\nwithout external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM\nconstructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features\nusing contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by\naligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,\nenabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show\nthat PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and\nstorage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based\nconditioning in diffusion models."}

In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided\ntest-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that\nmodulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework\nfor learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through\na tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model\nwhile optimizing for desired characteristics.

However, regular graph machine learning\nmethods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental\nlearning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new\nknowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the\npreviously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to\nmaintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,\ndo not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different\ntimestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns\ncan be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the\nnew data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic\nmixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a\nDyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming\ndata blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data\nsequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve\nold tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the\nnumber of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full\nmixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a\nsparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make\npredictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved\n4.92\\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class\nincremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power."}

While this approach is well established in tabular settings,\nextending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the\ncontinuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural\nnetworks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach\noffers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on\nvalue estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining\nthe strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their\ndrawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate\nthat DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and\noverall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer\ntechniques."}
