This lack of structure challenges interoperability, making data integration, validation, and reuse difficult. LinkML (Linked Data Modeling Language) is an open framework that simplifies the process of authoring, validating, and sharing data. LinkML can describe a range of data structures, from flat, list-based models to complex, interrelated, and normalized models that utilize polymorphism and compound inheritance. It offers an approachable syntax that is not tied to any one technical architecture and can be integrated seamlessly with many existing frameworks. The LinkML syntax provides a standard way to describe schemas, classes, and relationships, allowing modelers to build well-defined, stable, and optionally ontology-aligned data structures. Once defined, LinkML schemas may be imported into other LinkML schemas. These key features make LinkML an accessible platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and a reliable way to define and share data semantics.\n  LinkML helps reduce heterogeneity, complexity, and the proliferation of single-use data models while simultaneously enabling compliance with FAIR data standards. LinkML has seen increasing adoption in various fields, including biology, chemistry, biomedicine, microbiome research, finance, electrical engineering, transportation, and commercial software development. In short, LinkML makes implicit models explicitly computable and allows data to be standardized at its origin. LinkML documentation and code are available at linkml.io."}

Isolation levels offer a configurable mechanism to manage the interaction between concurrent transactions, enabling varying degrees of consistency and performance trade-offs. These isolation guarantees are supported by all major RDBMSs. However, testing transaction behavior under different isolation levels remains a significant challenge due to two primary reasons. First, automatically generating test transactions that can effectively expose bugs in transaction handling logic is non-trivial, as such bugs are typically triggered under specific transactional constraints. Second, detecting logic anomalies in transaction outcomes is difficult because the correct execution results are often unknown for randomly generated transactions. To address these challenges, we propose an anomaly pattern-guided testing approach for uncovering transaction bugs in RDBMSs. Our solution tackles the first challenge by introducing a test case generation technique guided by predefined anomaly patterns, which increases the likelihood of exposing transactional bugs. For the second challenge, we present a two-phase detection process, involving explicit error detection and implicit error detection, to identify bugs in transaction execution. We have implemented our approach in a tool, APTrans, and evaluated it on three widely-used RDBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, and OceanBase. APTrans successfully identified 13 previously unknown transaction-related bugs, 11 of which have been confirmed by the respective development teams."}

Currently, almost all algorithms follow an $ε$-Recall-Bounded principle when comparing performance: they require the ANN search results to achieve a recall of more than $1-ε$ and then compare query-per-second (QPS) performance. However, this approach only accounts for the recall of true positive results and does not provide guarantees on the deviation of incorrect results. To address this limitation, we focus on an Error-Bounded ANN method, which ensures that the returned results are a $(1/δ)$-approximation of the true values. Our approach adopts a graph-based framework. To enable Error-Bounded ANN search, we propose a $δ$-EMG (Error-bounded Monotonic Graph), which, for the first time, provides a provable approximation for arbitrary queries. By enforcing a $δ$-monotonic geometric constraint during graph construction, $δ$-EMG ensures that any greedy search converges to a $(1/δ)$-approximate neighbor without backtracking. Building on this foundation, we design an error-bounded top-$k$ ANN search algorithm that adaptively controls approximation accuracy during query time. To make the framework practical at scale, we introduce $δ$-EMQG (Error-bounded Monotonic Quantized Graph), a localized and degree-balanced variant with near-linear construction complexity. We further integrate vector quantization to accelerate distance computation while preserving theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on the ANN-Benchmarks dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Without intervention, these dropouts compromise the size and representativeness of the panel, prompting the question: Without seeing the dropouts ahead of time, can we choose panelists such that after dropouts, the panel will be representative and appropriately-sized? We model this problem as a minimax game: the minimizer aims to choose a panel that minimizes the loss, i.e., the deviation of the ultimate panel from predefined representation targets. Then, an adversary defines a distribution over dropouts from which the realized dropouts are drawn. Our main contribution is an efficient loss-minimizing algorithm, which remains optimal as we vary the maximizer's power from worst case to average case. Our algorithm - which iteratively plays a projected gradient descent subroutine against an efficient algorithm for computing the best-response dropout distribution - also addresses a key open question in the area: how to manage dropouts while ensuring that each potential panelist is chosen with relatively equal probabilities. Using real-world datasets, we compare our algorithms to existing benchmarks, and we offer the first characterizations of tradeoffs between robustness, loss, and equality in this problem."}

Building on the prior work establishing this uniqueness, we develop a quantitative stability theory that characterizes how approximate linearity of the optimal estimator constrains the prior distribution. For $L^2$ loss, we derive explicit rates showing that near-linearity of the conditional mean implies proximity of the prior to the Gaussian in the Lévy metric. For $L^1$ loss, we introduce a Hermite expansion framework and analyze the adjoint of the linearity-defining operator to show that the Gaussian remains the unique stable solution. Together, these results provide a more complete functional-analytic understanding of linearity and stability in Bayesian estimation under Gaussian noise."}

The maximum is taken over all edges $e$, and the underlying metric for the Wasserstein distance is the Hamming distance.\n  We first show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a polynomial-time $(1 - \\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm with sensitivity $Δ^{O(1/\\varepsilon)}$, where $Δ$ is the maximum degree of the input graph.

Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors."}

However, current PRAG approaches adopt a \\textbf{one-to-one} document encoding scheme, using a dedicated LoRA adapter for each individual document. This scheme introduces two major limitations: First, it leads to data scarcity, as the training datasets for individual LoRA adapters are limited. Second, it incurs high overhead during inference, requiring the merging of LLM weights with a new LoRA adapter for every candidate passage, which is computationally inefficient. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm for encoding passages in PRAG that utilizes a latent routing encoding process (Poly-PRAG). During offline encoding, we treat the encoding of a set of documents as a multi-task learning process, where each passage is assigned a unique task identifier. By employing a routing function, we use a small set of latent LoRA adapters to encode the entire passage space. During online inference, this routing function selectively activates a subset of latent experts based on the input query. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of Poly-PRAG across multiple knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.

ReqSketch (arXiv:2004.01668) is currently the most space-efficient summary with two key properties: relative error guarantees, offering increasingly higher accuracy towards the distribution's tails, and mergeability, allowing distributed or parallel processing of datasets. Due to these features and its simple algorithm design, ReqSketch has been adopted in practice, via implementation in the Apache DataSketches library. However, the proof of mergeability in ReqSketch is overly complicated, requiring an intricate charging argument and complex variance analysis.\n  In this paper, we provide a refined version of ReqSketch, by developing so-called adaptive compactors. This enables a significantly simplified proof of relative error guarantees in the most general mergeability setting, while retaining the original space bound, update time, and algorithmic simplicity. Moreover, the adaptivity of our sketch, together with the proof technique, yields near-optimal space bounds in specific scenarios - particularly when merging sketches of comparable size."}
