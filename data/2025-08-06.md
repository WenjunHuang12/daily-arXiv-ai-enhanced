*Baoquan Zhao,Xiaofan Ma,Qianshi Pang,Ruomei Wang,Fan Zhou,Shujin Lin*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: VisAug是一个交互式系统，通过基于视频语音内容生成视觉增强，提升语音丰富视频的导航和参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字技术的普及，语音丰富视频内容激增，但现有基于视觉的视频摘要和导航系统难以有效处理此类内容。

Method: 开发VisAug系统，自动生成基于语音内容的视觉增强。

Result: VisAug能显著提升视频信息的消费和参与度。

Conclusion: VisAug在视频驱动的数字环境中具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of digital technology has ushered in a new era of
digital transformation across all aspects of our lives. Online learning,
social, and work activities, such as distance education, videoconferencing,
interviews, and talks, have led to a dramatic increase in speech-rich video
content. In contrast to other video types, such as surveillance footage, which
typically contain abundant visual cues, speech-rich videos convey most of their
meaningful information through the audio channel. This poses challenges for
improving content consumption using existing visual-based video summarization,
navigation, and exploration systems. In this paper, we present VisAug, a novel
interactive system designed to enhance speech-rich video navigation and
engagement by automatically generating informative and expressive visual
augmentations based on the speech content of videos. Our findings suggest that
this system has the potential to significantly enhance the consumption and
engagement of information in an increasingly video-driven digital landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生活日志问答数据集规模小或为合成数据，限制了研究发展，因此需要构建一个开放且实用的真实数据集。

Method: 基于18个月的生活日志数据，构建了多样化和难度分级的14,187对问答，并进行了基线实验。

Abstract: Lifelogging refers to the process of passively collecting, storing, and
analysing personal daily life data using wearable devices. This data can
support applications in memory preservation and enhancement. For example, using
an ask-and-answer strategy, question-answering (QA) on lifelog data opens an
interactive and interesting way to explore memorable events and insights into
daily life. However, research resources for QA on lifelog data are limited to
small-sized or synthetic QA datasets. In this paper, we present a novel lifelog
QA dataset called OpenLifelogQA, building upon an 18-month lifelog dataset. Our
dataset focuses on an open-ended and practical QA with real-world application
in daily lifelog usage. We construct 14,187 pairs of Q&A with diverse types and
difficulty levels. A baseline experiment is reported for this dataset with
competitive average performance of 89.7% BERT Score, 25.87% ROUGE-L and 3.9665
LLM Score from LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave 7B model. We release this Q&A dataset to
the research community to support new research into lifelog technologies, such
as enabling personal chat-based assistants for lifelog data to become a
reality.

### [3] [Learned Adaptive Indexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03471)
*Suvam Kumar Das,Suprio Ray*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的自适应索引方法，动态构建索引并预测查询负载，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统索引和现有学习索引在动态负载下效率不足，需要一种自适应且高效的学习索引方法。

Method: 动态构建学习索引，结合查询负载预测技术，基于历史数据优化性能。

Result: 在多种查询负载下，性能提升1.2倍至5.6倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态环境中显著提升查询性能，填补了学习索引在自适应领域的空白。

Abstract: Indexes can significantly improve search performance in relational databases.
However, if the query workload changes frequently or new data updates occur
continuously, it may not be worthwhile to build a conventional index upfront
for query processing. Adaptive indexing is a technique in which an index gets
built on the fly as a byproduct of query processing. In recent years, research
in database indexing has taken a new direction where machine learning models
are employed for the purpose of indexing. These indexes, known as learned
indexes, can be more efficient compared to traditional indexes such as B+-tree
in terms of memory footprints and query performance. However, a learned index
has to be constructed upfront and requires training the model in advance, which
becomes a challenge in dynamic situations when workload changes frequently. To
the best of our knowledge, no learned indexes exist yet for adaptive indexing.
We propose a novel learned approach for adaptive indexing. It is built on the
fly as queries are submitted and utilizes learned models for indexing data. To
enhance query performance, we employ a query workload prediction technique that
makes future workload projection based on past workload data. We have evaluated
our learned adaptive indexing approach against existing adaptive indexes for
various query workloads. Our results show that our approach performs better
than others in most cases, offering 1.2x - 5.6x improvement in query
performance.

### [4] [[Technical Report] ArceKV: Towards Workload-driven LSM-compactions for Key-Value Store Under Dynamic Workloads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03565)
*Junfeng Liu,Haoxuan Xie,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: ElasticLSM通过移除传统LSM-tree的结构限制，结合Arce轻量级决策引擎，优化动态负载下的性能，ArceKV在动态场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实工作负载具有高度动态性，现有方法难以维持最优性能或切换开销大。

Method: 提出ElasticLSM和Arce决策引擎，实现灵活管理和性能优化。

Result: ArceKV在动态负载下性能提升约3倍。

Conclusion: ElasticLSM和Arce为动态工作负载提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Key-value stores underpin a wide range of applications due to their
simplicity and efficiency. Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM-trees) dominate as
their underlying structure, excelling at handling rapidly growing data. Recent
research has focused on optimizing LSM-tree performance under static workloads
with fixed read-write ratios. However, real-world workloads are highly dynamic,
and existing workload-aware approaches often struggle to sustain optimal
performance or incur substantial transition overhead when workload patterns
shift. To address this, we propose ElasticLSM, which removes traditional
LSM-tree structural constraints to allow more flexible management actions
(i.e., compactions and write stalls) creating greater opportunities for
continuous performance optimization. We further design Arce, a lightweight
compaction decision engine that guides ElasticLSM in selecting the optimal
action from its expanded action space. Building on these components, we
implement ArceKV, a full-fledged key-value store atop RocksDB. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that ArceKV outperforms state-of-the-art compaction
strategies across diverse workloads, delivering around 3x faster performance in
dynamic scenarios.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限状态空间上的离散时间薛定谔桥问题，首次证明了迭代马尔可夫拟合（IMF）算法具有指数收敛性，并给出了明确的收缩因子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已知IMF算法在Kullback-Leibler散度下收敛于真实解，但其收敛速度尚未量化。

Method: 通过理论分析，量化了IMF算法的收敛速度。

Result: 证明了IMF算法具有指数收敛性，并给出了明确的收缩因子。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了IMF算法收敛速度量化的空白，为相关领域提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We consider the discrete-time Schr\"odinger bridge problem on a finite state
space. Although it has been known that the Iterative Markovian Fitting (IMF)
algorithm converges in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the ground truth
solution, the speed of that convergence remained unquantified. In this work, we
establish for the first time that IMF exhibits exponential convergence with an
explicit contraction factor.

### [6] [Distributed Source Coding for Compressing Vector-Linear Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02996)
*Xuan Guang,Xiufang Sun,Ruze Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文研究了分布式源编码模型中向量线性函数的压缩问题，提出了压缩容量的下界，并对特定模型进行了容量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受移动卫星通信系统和计算任务应用的启发，研究如何高效压缩向量线性函数。

Method: 提出适用于任意连接状态和向量线性函数的压缩容量下界，并对特定模型（3源3编码器）进行分类分析。

Result: 将3×2矩阵分为两类，明确了两类模型的压缩容量，并发现下界在某些情况下不紧。

Conclusion: 研究结果应用于网络函数计算，回答了已知上界是否渐近紧的问题。

Abstract: Inspired by mobile satellite communication systems and the important and
prevalent applications of computational tasks, we consider a distributed source
coding model for compressing vector-linear functions, which consists of
multiple sources, multiple encoders and a decoder linked to all the encoders.
Each encoder has access to a certain subset of the sources and the decoder is
required to compute with zero error a vector-linear function of the source
information, which corresponds to a matrix $T$. The connectivity state between
the sources and the encoders and the vector-linear function are all arbitrary.
In the paper, we are interested in the function-compression capacity to measure
the efficiency of using the system. We first present a general lower bound on
the function-compression capacity applicable to arbitrary connectivity states
and vector-linear functions. Next, we confine to the nontrivial models with
only three sources and no more than three encoders, and prove that all the
$3\times2$ column-full-rank matrices $T$ can be divided into two types $T_1$
and $T_2$, for which the function-compression capacities are identical if the
matrices $T$ have the same type. We explicitly characterize the
function-compression capacities for two most nontrivial models associated with
$T_2$ by a novel approach of both upper bounding and lower bounding the size of
image sets of encoding functions. This shows that the lower bound thus obtained
is not always tight. Rather, by completely characterizing their capacities, the
lower bound is tight for all the models associated with $T_1$ and all the
models associated with $T_2$ except for the two most nontrivial models. We
finally apply the obtained results to network function computation and answer
the open problem whether the best known upper bound proved by Guang et. al.
(2019) on computing capacity is in general asymptotically tight.

Abstract: Subspace codes, especially constant dimension subspace codes (CDCs),
represent an intriguing domain that can be used to conduct basic coding theory
investigations. They have received widespread attention due to their
applications in random network coding. This paper presents inverse bilateral
multilevel construction by introducing inverse bilateral identifying vectors
and inverse bilateral Ferrers diagram rank-metric codes. By inserting the
inverse bilateral multilevel construction into the double multilevel
construction and bilateral multilevel construction, an effective construction
for CDCs is provided. Furthermore, via providing a new set of bilateral
identifying vectors, we give another efficient construction for CDCs. In this
article, several CDCs are exhibited, equipped with the rank-metric, with larger
sizes than the known ones in the existing literature. From a practical
standpoint, our results could help in the pragmatic framework of
constant-dimension-lifted rank-metric codes for applications in network coding.
The ratio of the new lower bound to the known upper bound for some CDCs is
calculated, which is greater than 0.94548 for any prime power $q \geq 3.$

### [8] [Channel Coding for Unequal Error Protection in Digital Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03381)
*Seonjung Kim,Yongjeong Oh,Yongjune Kim,Namyoon Lee,Yo-Seb Jeon*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新型信道编码框架，用于数字语义通信中的不等错误保护（UEP）问题，通过优化比特级和块级保护策略，显著提升任务性能和传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字语义通信中比特级语义重要性不等的问题，确保高重要性比特得到更强保护。

Method: 1. 基于重复编码的比特级UEP框架；2. 利用现代信道码的块级UEP框架，结合比特分组算法。

Result: 仿真实验表明，所提框架在图像传输任务中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 提出的UEP框架有效提升了语义通信的效率和性能。

Abstract: Semantic communication is an emerging paradigm that prioritizes transmitting
task-relevant information over accurately delivering raw data bits. In this
paper, we address an unequal error protection (UEP) problem in digital semantic
communication, where bits of higher semantic importance require stronger
protection. To quantify bit-level importance, we leverage bit-flip
probabilities of semantic bits as target error protection levels, which are
jointly learned with semantic encoder and decoder. We propose two novel channel
coding frameworks aimed at minimizing the total blocklength while satisfying
UEP constraints. First, we develop a bit-level UEP framework based on
repetition coding, in which the repetition number for each bit is optimized to
precisely meet its target bit-flip probability. Second, we introduce a
block-level UEP framework utilizing modern channel codes, where semantic bits
with similar target bit-flip probabilities are grouped to exploit coding gains.
Within this framework, we propose a bit-grouping algorithm guided by finite
blocklength capacity analysis. Simulation results conducted on image
transmission tasks confirm that the proposed frameworks significantly
outperform conventional approaches, yielding substantial improvements in both
task performance and transmission efficiency.

*Mehdi Dabirnia,Hamdi Joudeh,Albert Guillén i Fàbregas*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于带边信息的信源编码的净化方法，通过双域推导直接得到净化误差指数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在优化分布时的复杂性，双域方法参数少且适用于更广泛的场景。

Method: 采用双域方法推导两种不同的净化误差指数，并与现有方法对比。

Result: 两种指数中较优者与Csiszár-Körner指数一致，且在无边信息时与最优信源编码的误差指数一致。

Conclusion: 双域方法简化了优化过程，适用于更广泛的信源编码问题。

Abstract: We introduce an expurgation method for source coding with side information
that enables direct dual-domain derivations of expurgated error exponents.
Dual-domain methods yield optimization problems over few parameters, with any
sub-optimal choice resulting in an achievable exponent, as opposed to
primal-domain optimization over distributions. In addition, dual-domain methods
naturally allow for general alphabets and/or memory. We derive two such
expurgated error exponents for different random-coding ensembles. We show the
better of the exponents coincides with the Csisz\'ar-K\"orner exponent obtained
via a graph decomposition lemma. We show some numerical examples that
illustrate the differences between the two exponents and show that in the case
of source coding without side information, the expurgated exponent coincides
with the error exponent of the source optimal code.

### [10] [Decoding Algorithms for Twisted GRS Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03552)
*Guanghui Zhang,Liren Lin,Bocong Chen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于高斯消元法的新解码算法，用于MDS TGRS码和近MDS TGRS码，能够高效纠正错误并保持多项式时间复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典GRS码的代数能力，构建新的非GRS MDS码并增强密码学安全性。

Method: 使用高斯消元法设计解码算法，适用于MDS和近MDS TGRS码。

Result: 算法能纠正特定数量的错误，计算复杂度为O(n^3)。

Conclusion: 新算法填补了现有文献的空白，适用于更广泛的TGRS码解码场景。

Abstract: Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes were introduced to extend the
algebraic capabilities of classical generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. This
extension holds the potential for constructing new non-GRS maximum distance
separable (MDS) codes and enhancing cryptographic security. It is known that
TGRS codes with $1$ twist can either be MDS or near-MDS. In this paper, we
employ the Gaussian elimination method to propose new decoding algorithms for
MDS TGRS codes with parameters $[n,k,n-k+1]$. The algorithms can correct up to
$\lfloor \frac{n-k}{2}\rfloor$ errors when $n-k$ is odd, and $\lfloor
\frac{n-k}{2}\rfloor-1$ errors when $n-k$ is even. The computational complexity
for both scenarios is $O(n^3)$. %, where $\omega\approx 2.37286$ is the matrix
multiplication exponent. Our approach diverges from existing methods based on
Euclidean algorithm and addresses situations that have not been considered in
the existing literature \cite{SYJL}. Furthermore, this method is also
applicable to decoding near-MDS TGRS codes with parameters $[n, k, n-k]$,
enabling correction of up to $\lfloor \frac{n-k-1}{2} \rfloor$ errors, while
maintaining polynomial time complexity in $n$.

*Shreya Meel,Mohamed Nomeir,Pasan Dissanayake,Sanghamitra Dutta,Sennur Ulukus*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种保护用户隐私的框架，用于检索反事实解释，同时确保信息论隐私，并扩展到不可变特征和用户偏好的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，黑盒机器学习模型需要透明性和可解释性，但反事实解释可能威胁用户和机构的隐私。本文旨在保护用户在检索反事实解释时的隐私。

Method: 提出了私有反事实检索（PCR）和不可变PCR（I-PCR）方案，通过信息论方法保护用户隐私，并减少数据库信息泄露。

Result: 提出的方案在理论和数值实验中均实现了用户隐私保护，并比较了不同方案的数据库泄露程度。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了反事实解释中的隐私问题，适用于多种场景，包括不可变特征和用户偏好。

Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two important aspects to be considered
when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications.
Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement.
However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of the institution that is
providing the explanation, as well as the user who is requesting it. In this
work, we are primarily concerned with the user's privacy who wants to retrieve
a counterfactual instance, without revealing their feature vector to the
institution. Our framework retrieves the exact nearest neighbor counterfactual
explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect,
information-theoretic, privacy for the user. First, we introduce the problem of
private counterfactual retrieval (PCR) and propose a baseline PCR scheme that
keeps the user's feature vector information-theoretically private from the
institution. Building on this, we propose two other schemes that reduce the
amount of information leaked about the institution database to the user,
compared to the baseline scheme. Second, we relax the assumption of mutability
of all features, and consider the setting of immutable PCR (I-PCR). Here, the
user retrieves the nearest counterfactual without altering a private subset of
their features, which constitutes the immutable set, while keeping their
feature vector and immutable set private from the institution. For this, we
propose two schemes that preserve the user's privacy information-theoretically,
but ensure varying degrees of database privacy. Third, we extend our PCR and
I-PCR schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their
attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Finally, we
present numerical results to support our theoretical findings, and compare the
database leakage of the proposed schemes.

### [12] [Realizing Scaling Laws in Recommender Systems: A Foundation-Expert Paradigm for Hyperscale Model Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02929)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在超大规模模型部署中面临独特挑战，如在线流数据学习、多任务适应性和严格的计算延迟限制，现有方法难以满足这些需求。

Method: 采用Foundation-Expert范式，通过中心化FM学习通用知识，再通过目标感知嵌入将其高效转移到轻量级专家模型，同时开发了HyperCast基础设施系统支持训练和服务。

Conclusion: Foundation-Expert范式首次成功应用于超大规模推荐系统，为推荐系统的规模化提供了高效、开发者友好的解决方案。

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender
systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved
challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as
natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender
systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from
online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to
different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream
tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational
constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert
Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale
recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,
cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This
knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,
surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to
adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.
To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a
production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,
logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now
deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating
online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while
improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of
a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,
compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of
scaling laws in recommender systems.

Motivation: 银行监管者需要确保新措施与历史先例一致，但这一任务复杂且耗时。

Method: 系统结合了词汇、语义和CRR模糊集匹配技术，并采用Transformer去噪自编码器进行微调。

Result: 系统在部分标记数据场景下表现稳健，MAP@100为0.83，MRR@100为0.92，优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 该系统为银行监管者提供了高效、准确的工具，显著提升了措施制定的质量和效率。

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are
consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist
supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system
ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most
relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive
database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed
measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system
ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The
performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled
data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness
and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for
fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of
0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those
of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

Abstract: Vector search, which returns the vectors most similar to a given query vector
from a large vector dataset, underlies many important applications such as
search, recommendation, and LLMs. To be economic, vector search needs to be
efficient to reduce the resources required by a given query workload. However,
existing vector search libraries (e.g., Faiss and DiskANN) are optimized for
x86 CPU architectures (i.e., Intel and AMD CPUs) while Huawei Kunpeng CPUs are
based on the ARM architecture and competitive in compute power. In this paper,
we present KBest as a vector search library tailored for the latest Kunpeng 920
CPUs. To be efficient, KBest incorporates extensive hardware-aware and
algorithmic optimizations, which include single-instruction-multiple-data
(SIMD) accelerated distance computation, data prefetch, index refinement, early
termination, and vector quantization. Experiment results show that KBest
outperforms SOTA vector search libraries running on x86 CPUs, and our
optimizations can improve the query throughput by over 2x. Currently, KBest
serves applications from both our internal business and external enterprise

TL;DR: ADSeeker通过知识驱动的推理提升工业视觉检测性能，结合SEEK-M&V知识库和Q2K RAG框架，在零样本异常检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在工业视觉检测中性能不足的问题，特别是异常检测知识整合不足和技术语言生成不精确的挑战。

Method: 提出ADSeeker框架，利用SEEK-M&V知识库和Q2K RAG技术，结合Hierarchical Sparse Prompt机制和类型级特征提取异常模式。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现零样本检测的最优性能，并发布最大规模的异常检测数据集MulA。

Conclusion: ADSeeker为工业视觉检测提供了一种高效的知识驱动解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Automatic vision inspection holds significant importance in industry
inspection. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong
language understanding capabilities and hold promise for this task, their
performance remains significantly inferior to that of human experts. In this
context, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of
anomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of
technically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning.
To address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant
designed to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded
reasoning. ADSeeker leverages a curated visual document knowledge base,
SEEK-MVTec&VisA (SEEK-M&V), which we construct to address the limitations of
existing resources that rely solely on unstructured text. SEEK-M&V includes
semantic-rich descriptions and image-document pairs, enabling more
comprehensive anomaly understanding. To effectively retrieve and utilize this
knowledge, we introduce the Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Q2K RAG) framework. To further enhance the performance in zero-shot
anomaly detection (ZSAD), ADSeeker leverages the Hierarchical Sparse Prompt
mechanism and type-level features to efficiently extract anomaly patterns.
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of limited in industry anomaly detection
(IAD) data, we introduce the largest-scale AD dataset, Multi-type Anomaly
(MulA), encompassing 72 multi-scale defect types across 26 Categories.
Extensive experiments show that our plug-and-play framework, ADSeeker, achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的双重解缠框架（DDSRec），用于多样化序列推荐，通过解缠用户兴趣和意图建模，平衡准确性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户交互序列增长和兴趣意图复杂纠缠导致多样性挑战。

Method: 采用双重解缠视角（交互建模和表示学习）优化用户兴趣和意图建模。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了DDSRec在准确性和多样性上的优越性。

Conclusion: DDSRec有效解决了序列推荐中的多样性问题，同时保持准确性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation predicts user preferences over time and has
achieved remarkable success. However, the growing length of user interaction
sequences and the complex entanglement of evolving user interests and
intentions introduce significant challenges to diversity. To address these, we
propose a model-agnostic Dual-disentangle framework for Diversified Sequential
Recommendation (DDSRec). The framework refines user interest and intention
modeling by adopting disentangling perspectives in interaction modeling and
representation learning, thereby balancing accuracy and diversity in sequential
recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of DDSRec in terms of accuracy and diversity
for sequential recommendations.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种更稳健的检索评估协议，通过高精度评分（HPS）和关联感知检索指标（TRM）解决低精度计算中的虚假平局问题，提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度计算在检索系统中广泛用于提高效率，但会导致虚假平局，增加结果的不确定性，影响评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出HPS（在最终评分步骤提升精度以减少平局）和TRM（量化平局候选的顺序不确定性）。

Result: 实验表明HPS显著减少平局引起的不稳定性，TRM准确恢复预期指标值。

Conclusion: HPS和TRM的组合为低精度检索提供了更一致和可靠的评估系统。

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统中，用户和物品的表示通常由两个独立的神经网络生成，而多模态表示学习中权重共享已被证明有效。受此启发，研究旨在通过权重共享优化推荐系统。

Method: 提出CoBraR框架，使用单一协作分支（Collaborative Branch for Recommendation）实现用户和物品表示的权重共享。

Result: 在电商和电影推荐实验中，CoBraR减少了参数数量，并在不损失准确性的情况下提升了推荐效果。

Conclusion: CoBraR具有实际应用潜力，可扩展至现实场景。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in
a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores.
In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of
two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation
learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance
between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we
propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN
modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding
space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for
Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative
experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that
by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects
without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and
extended for real-world scenarios.

Result: 在四个多领域查询数据集和两个多跳QA数据集上验证了MultiRAG的可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: MultiRAG显著提升了多源场景下知识检索的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单向量搜索在信息检索中存在性能下降问题，多向量方法（如ColBERT）虽表现优越，但缺乏易用工具。PyLate旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PyLate基于Sentence Transformers，支持多向量架构，提供高效索引等功能，且代码改动小。

Result: PyLate已成功开发出先进模型（如GTE-ModernColBERT和Reason-ModernColBERT），展示了其研究和实用价值。

Conclusion: PyLate为多向量模型的研究和应用提供了高效工具，有助于释放其在现代信息检索系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

Motivation: 序列推荐系统（SRSs）虽然能有效捕捉用户偏好，但其“黑盒”特性导致解释性差。本文旨在通过反事实解释技术提升其透明度和用户信任。

Method: 提出了一种专为离散序列设计的遗传算法，证明生成反事实解释是NP完全问题，并在四种实验设置下评估其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为可解释AI领域提供了通过“假设”场景理解序列推荐决策的框架，增强了用户信任和系统透明度。

Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have demonstrated remarkable
effectiveness in capturing users' evolving preferences. However, their inherent
complexity as "black box" models poses significant challenges for
explainability. This work presents the first counterfactual explanation
technique specifically developed for SRSs, introducing a novel approach in this
space, addressing the key question: What minimal changes in a user's
interaction history would lead to different recommendations? To achieve this,
we introduce a specialized genetic algorithm tailored for discrete sequences
and show that generating counterfactual explanations for sequential data is an
NP-Complete problem. We evaluate these approaches across four experimental
settings, varying between targeted-untargeted and categorized-uncategorized
scenarios, to comprehensively assess their capability in generating meaningful
explanations. Using three different datasets and three models, we are able to
demonstrate that our methods successfully generate interpretable counterfactual
explanation while maintaining model fidelity close to one. Our findings
contribute to the growing field of Explainable AI by providing a framework for
understanding sequential recommendation decisions through the lens of "what-if"
scenarios, ultimately enhancing user trust and system transparency.

Motivation: 解决广告关键词推荐中因点击数据偏差导致的推荐不准确问题，同时避免人工标注的困难。

Method: 采用两步LLM蒸馏：从LLM教师模型通过交叉编码器助手蒸馏到双编码器学生模型，结合多任务训练。

Result: 该方法提高了双编码器在eBay广告关键词检索中的性能。

Conclusion: LLM蒸馏与多任务训练结合能有效提升关键词推荐的相关性和准确性。

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the
performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases
is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items
and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase
recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.
Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing
LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in
several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation
process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)
model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM
teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a
multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to
retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge
distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances
bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

Conclusion: RED系统在动态商业环境中首次实现大规模食物集合推荐，离线指标与在线表现强相关。

Abstract: Food delivery platforms face the challenge of helping users navigate vast
catalogs of restaurants and dishes to find meals they truly enjoy. This paper
presents RED, an automated recommendation system designed for iFood, Latin
America's largest on-demand food delivery platform, to personalize the
selection of curated food collections displayed to millions of users. Our
approach employs a LightGBM classifier that scores collections based on three
feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and
contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly
created collections, we develop content-based representations using item
embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We
tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and
address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases
in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through
extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our
A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase
in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,
our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,
enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food
collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

Motivation: 在线公平分配中，经典公平性概念如EF1和MMS难以近似，而PROP1的近似性尚未解决，因此探索其可行性。

Method: 分析了贪婪算法在自适应对手下的表现，研究了非自适应对手下的随机分配，并设计了基于最大物品价值预测的算法。

Result: 贪婪算法在自适应对手下无法保证PROP1，随机分配在非自适应对手下有效，基于预测的算法能获得稳健的PROP1近似。

Conclusion: PROP1在特定条件下可近似，但更强的公平性概念即使有完美预测仍不可近似。

Abstract: We study the online fair division problem, where indivisible goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated immediately and irrevocably to agents. Prior
work has established strong impossibility results for approximating classic
fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and maximin share fairness, in this
setting. In contrast, we focus on proportionality up to one good (PROP1), a
natural relaxation of proportionality whose approximability remains unresolved.
We begin by showing that three natural greedy algorithms fail to guarantee any
positive approximation to PROP1 in general, against an adaptive adversary. This
is surprising because greedy algorithms are commonly used in fair division and
a natural greedy algorithm is known to be able to achieve PROP1 under
additional information assumptions. This hardness result motivates the study of
non-adaptive adversaries and the use of side-information, in the spirit of
learning-augmented algorithms. For non-adaptive adversaries, we show that the
simple uniformly random allocation can achieve a meaningful PROP1 approximation
with high probability. Meanwhile, we present an algorithm that obtain robust
approximation ratios against PROP1 when given predictions of the maximum item
value (MIV). Interestingly, we also show that stronger fairness notions such as
EF1, MMS, and PROPX remain inapproximable even with perfect MIV predictions.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility

Result: 证明了方法的完备性和正确性，适用于无DCA的有界规划问题。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了传统规划的范围，适用于动态对象变化的场景，并通过概念验证实现展示了可行性。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出更高的准确性和多样性，有望提升LBS数据在移动性分析中的实用性。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework

Result: CLIO使GPT-4.1在HLE测试中的准确率提升13.82%，并揭示了不确定性波动对结果的关键影响。

Conclusion: CLIO为科学决策提供了透明且可控的AI工具，其开放设计有助于深入理解推理机制。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

Motivation: 减轻放射科医生的工作负担，并解决现有基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）方法在RVQA中的挑战。

Method: 设计了一个多代理系统（MAS），包含上下文理解、多模态推理和答案验证的专门代理。

Conclusion: 多代理方法在需要复杂推理的可解释和可信临床AI应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于游戏Countdown的规划基准测试方法，以弥补现有基准测试在衡量长期规划能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准测试无法有效衡量基础模型和智能体的长期规划能力，亟需一种更合适的测试方法。

Method: 提出了一种围绕Countdown游戏的基准测试生成方法，该问题具有自然语言描述、计算复杂性（NP完全）和丰富的实例空间。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法优于公共基准测试，实验证明现有LLM辅助规划方法在该动态基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Countdown基准测试为评估规划能力提供了更有效的工具，尤其适合挑战现有LLM方法的局限性。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的无线网络多任务预测基础模型，支持不同预测区间，通过分解、编码和因果Transformer实现高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动通信网络复杂性增加，传统深度学习方法难以泛化到不同场景和任务。

Method: 采用单变量分解统一异构任务，编码粒度实现区间感知，使用因果Transformer骨干网络，并引入补丁掩码策略支持任意输入长度。

Result: 在大规模数据集上训练后，模型在未见场景中表现出强泛化能力，并在新任务上实现零样本性能超越传统基线。

Conclusion: 提出的基础模型为无线网络多任务预测提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing complexity and dynamics of the mobile communication
networks, accurately predicting key system parameters, such as channel state
information (CSI), user location, and network traffic, has become essential for
a wide range of physical (PHY)-layer and medium access control (MAC)-layer
tasks. Although traditional deep learning (DL)-based methods have been widely
applied to such prediction tasks, they often struggle to generalize across
different scenarios and tasks. In response, we propose a unified foundation
model for multi-task prediction in wireless networks that supports diverse
prediction intervals. The proposed model enforces univariate decomposition to
unify heterogeneous tasks, encodes granularity for interval awareness, and uses
a causal Transformer backbone for accurate predictions. Additionally, we
introduce a patch masking strategy during training to support arbitrary input
lengths. After trained on large-scale datasets, the proposed foundation model
demonstrates strong generalization to unseen scenarios and achieves zero-shot
performance on new tasks that surpass traditional full-shot baselines.

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the
reasoning capability for mainstream large language models (LLMs), but the same
is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务分解和简单标准判断，其性能接近人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以程序化评估渗透测试代理的操作质量，因此开发PentestJudge以提供可扩展且全面的评估方法。

Method: 使用树状结构将渗透测试任务分解为简单子任务，通过LLM作为评委评估代理行为，并与人类专家评分对比。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数为0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家表现。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在评估渗透测试任务中的潜力，验证可能比生成更容易，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化复杂的环境建模流程，降低地球观测数据、物理工具与决策者之间的门槛。

Method: 利用视觉支持的大型语言模型，动态解析地图和栅格数据，指导关键决策如出口选择、参数初始化和不确定性分析。

Result: 初步实验表明，AQUAH能完成冷启动模拟并生成分析师就绪的文档，结果被专家评为清晰、透明且物理合理。

Conclusion: 尽管仍需进一步校准和验证，但AQUAH展示了基于LLM和视觉的代理在环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具选择性高，模型在简单感知任务中的错误会阻碍其临床采用。

Method: 引入Medblink基准，涵盖8个临床任务，共1,429道多选题和1,605张图像，评估19种先进MLM。

Result: 人类准确率96.4%，最佳模型仅65%，显示MLMs在常规感知任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLMs视觉基础不足，需改进以支持临床采用。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标记数据的方法在动态问题中效果有限，需自动化生成和优化工作流。

Method: 结合任务流图和代码表示工作流，使用多网格图优化和自反射进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath在动态问题中表现出色，无需标记数据，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上测试，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下接近完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升LLM伦理提供了一种轻量、高效的解决方案，适用于多种GenAI场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍，兼容现有功能调用标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解和实际解决方案，推动大语言模型应用开发。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

Conclusion: 代理评估可补充人类监督，但仍需解决偏见、鲁棒性等挑战，为下一代LLMs的可信评估提供方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最优性能，并显著提高令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过多智能体协作学习框架有效解决了MILP求解中模块策略独立学习的问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ICL在NLP中的机制及其在非线性数值问题中的应用潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在复杂医疗诊断任务中因推理深度不足导致信息丢失或逻辑跳跃，从而产生诊断错误。

Method: 提出ToR框架，采用树状结构记录推理路径和临床证据，并引入多智能体交叉验证机制确保决策一致性。

Result: 在真实医疗数据上的实验表明，ToR框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架通过结构化推理和多智能体协作，显著提升了复杂医疗场景下的临床推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种认知驱动防御框架（CDD），通过模拟人类认知推理来防御大型语言模型的越狱攻击，结合监督微调和强化学习提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖浅层模式匹配，难以应对新型攻击策略，因此需要更通用的防御机制。

Method: CDD框架通过全局感知和局部分析揭示隐藏操作，结合监督微调和熵引导的强化学习（EG-GRPO）增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: CDD框架为防御越狱攻击提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

*Shuang Liu,Zelong Li,Ruoyun Ma,Haiyan Zhao,Mengnan Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文评估开源与专有大语言模型在法律风险分析中的表现，发现专有模型总体更优，开源模型需针对性优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源大语言模型在法律领域的潜力，解决数据保密性问题，填补法律风险分析评估的空白。

Method: 使用ContractEval基准和CUAD数据集，评估4个专有和15个开源模型在商业合同条款风险识别中的表现。

Result: 专有模型表现更优，开源模型在特定维度有竞争力；模型规模、推理模式、量化等影响性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化以提升正确性和有效性，ContractEval为法律领域LLM发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的自动化启发式集合设计（AHSD）方法，通过生成互补的启发式集合来提升泛化能力，实验表明其性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化启发式设计（AHD）方法仅生成单一启发式，导致在不同问题实例上泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出AHSD框架，设计互补启发式集合，并开发EoH-S算法，结合互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索。

Result: 在三个AHD任务中，EoH-S性能显著优于现有方法，最高提升60%。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S为LLM驱动的AHD提供了更优的解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的缺失数据填补方法存在高推理延迟和输出可变性，限制了其在实际表格数据中的应用。

Method: 提出MissDDIM，一种基于DDIM的条件扩散框架，专注于表格数据填补。

Result: MissDDIM通过确定性采样减少了输出可变性，同时保持了填补的多样性。

Conclusion: MissDDIM为表格数据填补提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T2UE框架通过仅使用文本描述生成不可学习示例（UEs），解决了现有方法需要暴露原始图像数据的隐私矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成不可学习示例的方法需要联合优化图像和文本，计算成本高且依赖第三方服务，导致隐私泄露。

Method: 提出T2UE框架，利用文本到图像模型将文本映射到噪声空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效噪声。

Result: 实验表明，T2UE保护的数据显著降低了最先进模型在下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了“零接触数据保护”，仅需文本描述即可保护数据，无需直接暴露原始数据。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能教育中的生成代理模型尚未充分发展，且教育情境复杂，涉及个性化的人与人交互。

Method: 提出AgentSME框架，采用三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo），以准确性为主要指标，辅以多样性评估。测试了六种LLM。

Result: Echo模式准确性最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代理学习能力和智能教育模型提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠LLM代理提供了可扩展、可验证且原则性的路径。

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query
into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for

Conclusion: Geoint-R1为形式几何推理提供了有效的解决方案，并通过Geoint基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

Motivation: 现实任务中需要建模实体间的动态交互，如交通中的车辆行为或金融交易中的资金流动，传统方法难以有效捕捉这种时空关系。

Method: 引入全历史图模型，区分时间步内和时间步间边，并设计ETDNet网络，结合图注意力和时间注意力模块。

Result: 在Waymo和Elliptic++数据集上，ETDNet分别将联合准确率提升至75.6%和非法类F1分数提升至88.1%。

Conclusion: 通过将结构和时间关系表示为图中的不同边，显著提升了动态交互建模的效果。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Result: 7B LFMs在ToolVQA上表现优异，并在OOD数据集上超越GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA和ToolEngine有效提升了模型在真实世界工具使用中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

Method: Nemori采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），自主组织语义连贯的记忆单元并主动学习预测差距。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长期动态工作流提供了可行的解决方案，解决了记忆粒度和知识进化的关键问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。传统云数据中心部署代理会导致高延迟，而边缘部署虽能减少延迟，却面临资源有限和异构性的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，结合蚁群算法和LLM优化，建模资源约束与延迟/成本，实现高效代理放置与轻量级迁移。

Result: 在分布式系统（AgentScope）上实现并验证，显著降低了部署延迟和迁移成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM代理的高效部署与管理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs使用CoT提示时生成的冗长推理过程存在冗余，增加了推理成本并降低了效率。

Method: 引入步骤熵度量冗余，提出两阶段训练策略（SFT和GRPO），让LLM自主生成压缩推理过程。

Result: 实验表明80%的低熵步骤可被剪枝，且对准确性影响极小；随机或高熵剪枝会严重损害性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升LLM推理效率，为实际部署和对推理结构的理解提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床实用且语言鲁棒的语音认知评估工具提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在通用逻辑推理中表现不足，神经符号AI试图将逻辑融入神经网络以解决这一问题。

Method: 比较两种方法：集成方法（逻辑推理内置于神经网络）和混合方法（符号求解器独立于神经网络）。通过案例研究（LNN和LLM-SS）分析其表现。

Result: 混合方法在通用逻辑推理中更具潜力，因其推理链更可解释且保留LLM优势。

Conclusion: 提出基于LLM-SS的通用框架，支持未来混合方法的研究。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在代码生成中存在歧义，难以捕捉复杂需求和隐式数据依赖。

Method: 1. 扩展UML序列图，整合决策表和API规范；2. 引入数据依赖推理任务（DDI），构建显式依赖图。

Result: 通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少歧义，提升代码生成准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架有效解决了复杂需求下的代码生成问题，结合形式化规范和LLM的数学优势，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂错误的识别和诊断上表现不佳，主要因为训练目标倾向于正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出HSG框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky（生成隐蔽错误）和Diagnosis（检测错误），通过对抗协同进化提升能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，HSG显著提升了错误诊断准确率，比GPT-4o等基线模型高16.8%--31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG框架有效提升了模型的错误诊断能力，并发布了具有挑战性的数据集，为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM方法在诊断不可行路由问题时无法考虑多种调整的问题。

Method: 结合LLM代理和多目标优化，生成包含不同调整程度的解决方案，并通过LLM分析提取诊断建议。

Result: 在50类不可行路由问题上，MOID单次运行即可生成多种诊断建议，提供更实用的决策支持。

Conclusion: MOID通过多目标优化和LLM分析，显著提升了不可行路由问题的诊断能力。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

Conclusion: 该形式化为分析信念系统的内部组织（如一致性、认知张力）提供了基础，比现有方法更丰富地分类认知状态。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化或生活方式改变）。收集新数据成本高且隐私敏感，因此需要一种高效的数据生成方法。

Method: SmartGen包含四个模块：时间和语义感知分割、语义感知序列压缩、图引导序列合成和两阶段异常过滤器。

Result: 实验表明，SmartGen显著提升了行为漂移下的异常检测（85.43%）和行为预测（70.51%）性能。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过生成高质量的行为数据，有效解决了智能家居模型的行为漂移问题。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低成本和计算开销，同时提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM为数学任务提供了一种高效、可配置的错误检测与纠正方法。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

Conclusion: 大规模激活的涌现可通过模型设计预测和控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期等有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Evo-MCTS的新框架，通过结合树搜索、进化优化和语言模型启发式，解决了引力波信号识别中现有方法的局限性，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如匹配滤波和深度神经网络）在引力波信号识别中存在计算量大和决策逻辑不透明等问题，需要一种更高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 提出Evo-MCTS框架，结合树搜索、进化优化和语言模型启发式，系统探索算法空间并生成可解释的算法。

Result: 在MLGWSC-1基准数据集上，性能提升20.2%，且生成的算法变体表现优异。

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还发现了新的算法组合，为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法论。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

TL;DR: Agent Lightning是一个灵活的框架，通过强化学习训练大型语言模型，实现与现有AI代理的无缝集成，无需代码修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将强化学习与代理紧密耦合或依赖序列拼接，限制了灵活性和扩展性。

Method: 通过将代理执行建模为马尔可夫决策过程，定义统一数据接口，并提出分层强化学习算法LightningRL，支持复杂交互逻辑。

Result: 实验在文本到SQL、检索增强生成和数学工具使用任务中展示了稳定且持续的改进。

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界中的代理训练和部署提供了潜力。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在特定领域应用中需要高效微调，但现有混合PEFT方法缺乏不确定性量化和动态适应能力。

Method: 结合Adapter、LoRA和前缀调优技术，将可学习参数建模为分布以实现不确定性量化，并提出贝叶斯动态微调方法。

Result: 在情感分析、新闻分类等任务中表现优于现有PEFT基线，支持不确定性量化和动态适应性。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT为商业分析和数据科学提供了一种支持不确定性感知和自适应决策的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Result: 在SVHN、CIFAR10、CIFAR100、STL10和噪声CIFAR10上测试准确率优于Adam。

Conclusion: ZetA是Adam的高效且鲁棒的替代方案，适用于噪声或高粒度分类任务。

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

Result: 模型能生成高保真、多样化的ECG信号，并保留个体特征，下游应用显示其提升ECG自动诊断的潜力。

Conclusion: ECGTwin为精准个性化医疗提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Conclusion: 模型架构和损失函数的选择应根据预测任务的具体需求决定，研究为体育分析提供了实用框架。

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合密度网络（MDN）的概率建模框架，用于准确捕捉FeFET的随机性，解决了现有模型在稳定性和变异性建模上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFET的随机性（来自操作循环和制造变异性）对准确建模构成挑战，现有确定性或机器学习模型难以全面捕捉变异性或缺乏数学平滑性。

Method: 采用混合密度网络（MDN）基础，结合C-infinity连续激活函数和设备特定嵌入层，生成合成设备实例进行变异性感知模拟。

Result: 模型在捕捉FeFET电流行为变异性上表现出高准确性（R2=0.92）。

Conclusion: 该框架为FeFET的全面随机行为建模提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，为未来紧凑模型开发和电路仿真集成奠定了基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich
structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering
spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance
of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large
pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken
from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas
Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that
pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预测充分性原则的新状态空间模型（MPS-SSM），通过优化目标函数设计选择性机制，显著提升了序列建模的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性状态空间模型（如Mamba）依赖启发式设计，缺乏理论支持，可能导致次优和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 引入预测充分性原则，提出MPS-SSM框架，通过优化目标函数实现选择性机制，压缩历史信息并保留预测能力。

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在长期预测和噪声场景中显著优于现有模型，并展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优越，其预测充分性原则还可推广为通用正则化框架，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive survey and benchmark of pulse shape

sixty methods into statistical (time-domain, frequency-domain, neural
network-based) and prior-knowledge (machine learning, deep learning) paradigms.
We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an
unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a
238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,
ROC-AUC, and inter-method correlations. Our analysis reveals that deep learning
models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches
combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

Motivation: 复数数据在信号处理中广泛存在，但现有散度框架未充分支持复数向量，因此需要扩展alpha-beta散度以适应复数数据。

Result: 新散度框架在复数向量逼近问题中具有闭式解，揭示了超参数的不同作用。

Conclusion: 扩展的alpha-beta散度为复数数据提供了灵活的散度框架，有望在信号处理领域广泛应用。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法在长上下文场景中无法适应动态注意力模式，且忽视了边缘信息的重要性。

Result: 在GSM8K等基准测试中表现优异，吞吐量比基线方法高1.75-2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境下实现了高效且高性能的LLM推理。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在建模复杂时间依赖时存在静态分解策略、碎片化依赖建模和不灵活融合机制的限制。

Method: DMSC包含多尺度块分解（EMPD）、三元交互块（TIB）和自适应尺度路由MoE块（ASR-MoE），动态分解序列并建模多尺度依赖。

Result: 在13个真实基准测试中，DMSC保持SOTA性能和高效计算。

Conclusion: DMSC通过动态多尺度协调显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Method: 引入多个结构化提示，每个提示包含一个自适应令牌，联合处理所有提示并生成统一文本表示，结合多样性正则化损失和否定感知损失优化。

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索任务中均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多提示和优化损失函数，显著提升了语义对齐和对比学习效果。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布鲁棒评估和学习方法过于保守，导致评估结果和策略不理想。

Method: 使用结构方程模型（SEM）构建不确定性集，结合条件独立性检验检测变量偏移。

Result: SEM方法在评估和策略学习上更准确，尤其在大偏移情况下表现更好，并能学习到最优策略。

Conclusion: SEM方法优于传统方法，假设模型足够准确时能学习到最优策略。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

Result: 在基准数据集上验证，防御方法性能接近原始RAG系统。

Conclusion: FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG能有效防御PoisonedRAG攻击，保持RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Motivation: 改进PPO算法，简化强化学习中的策略优化过程，同时保持无评论家结构。

Method: GRPO用组归一化奖励替代PPO的价值函数，保留令牌级重要性采样；TIC GRPO进一步用轨迹级概率比替代令牌级采样。

Result: GRPO在旧策略上估计梯度，但偏差影响小；TIC GRPO提供无偏估计，性能与标准GRPO相当。

Conclusion: GRPO及其变体TIC GRPO在简化强化学习策略优化方面有效，TIC GRPO进一步优化了无偏性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

Motivation: 现有抗体设计方法采用统一生成策略，无法适应不同抗原的独特需求，而生物中的B细胞亲和力成熟过程提供了多目标优化的灵感。

Method: 利用物理领域知识，结合多专家系统（如范德华力、分子识别等），通过在线元学习动态调整参数，模拟自然抗体优化过程。

Conclusion: 该框架为抗体设计提供了一种自适应、个性化的优化范式，适用于多样化的抗原目标。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

Result: 在增强的MegaVul数据集上，模型大小减少99.4%，保留89.3%的原始模型准确率，优于现有基线1.7%的准确率且参数减少60%。训练时间减少72.1%，架构搜索时间减少34.88%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限场景下实现了高效且高性能的漏洞评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索KANs在无监督故障检测中的应用潜力，尤其是在化学过程中，以解决传统方法在数据效率上的不足。

Method: 比较四种KAN-AE变体（EfficientKAN、FastKAN、FourierKAN和WavKAN）与Orthogonal Autoencoder (OAE) 在Tennessee Eastman Process上的性能，使用Fault Detection Rate (FDR) 作为指标。

Result: WavKAN-AE在仅4,000样本下达到最高FDR（≥92%），EfficientKAN-AE在500样本下表现稳健（≥90%）。FastKAN-AE在大规模数据下竞争，FourierKAN-AE表现较差。OAE需要更多数据才能匹配KAN-AE性能。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs在数据效率和故障检测性能上表现出色，适用于数据受限的工业场景，并可能提升模型透明度。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

<details>

Motivation: 传统最小二乘优化在高斯噪声下表现良好，但在非对称结构化噪声下效果不佳，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器处理数值序列，压缩神经网络预测符号参数，固定符号方程重建序列，训练目标是在添加非对称结构化噪声后恢复原始序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，模型的中值回归MSE为6e-6至3.5e-5，比普通最小二乘和鲁棒回归技术（如Huber损失或SoftL1）提升了10-300倍。

Conclusion: 混合神经符号架构在非对称结构化噪声下表现出色，显著优于传统回归方法。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Conclusion: CauKer为TSFMs的高效预训练提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Conclusion: 正交雅可比矩阵框架不仅涵盖现有架构，还能设计新网络，扩展性强。

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

Conclusion: PENODE在保持物理可解释性的同时，实现了高效的边缘部署和实时控制增强。

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Result: 算法性能接近理论下界，优于KL-UCB等现有算法。

Conclusion: Clus-UCB有效利用了聚类结构，未来可进一步研究其局限性。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm

conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在线学习方法RONAVI，用于解决多智能体系统在现实环境中的模型不匹配问题，通过优化最坏情况性能提升系统鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中多智能体系统可能因训练与部署环境的不匹配而失效，现有方法依赖模拟器或离线数据，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出RONAVI算法，支持在线学习，无需先验数据，直接通过环境交互学习。

Result: 理论分析表明，RONAVI在Total Variation和Kullback-Leibler散度下能实现低遗憾并找到最优鲁棒策略。

Conclusion: RONAVI为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Method: 提出估计条件后验均值，将其转化为单参数最大似然估计问题，并集成到标准采样器中。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，性能优于或与现有逆问题求解器相当。

Conclusion: 通过整合测量信息和优化停止准则，提升了扩散模型在逆问题中的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate
neighborhood graphs. Our approach significantly reduces computational cost
while preserving clustering quality. Empirically, it scales to datasets with
millions of points in minutes and achieves competitive accuracy compared to
existing baselines.

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a
differentiable k-means distillation module, facilitating efficient end-to-end
knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet show that DFedCAD consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance, attaining the highest accuracy across all evaluated settings while
reducing communication overhead by over 86%. Our framework provides a scalable
and practical solution for efficient decentralized learning in dynamic,
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的混合精度量化方法（SMPQ），通过直接测量位宽操作对任务的贡献，改进了传统梯度下降方法（DMPQ）的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 现有混合精度量化方法（MPQ）通过梯度下降优化位宽分配，但位宽选择过程未充分研究，量化参数的大小未必反映其对任务性能的实际贡献。

Method: 提出SMPQ方法，利用Shapley值直接测量位宽操作的贡献，并采用蒙特卡洛采样降低计算成本。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，SMPQ表现优于基于梯度的方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SMPQ通过更准确的位宽贡献评估，显著提升了混合精度量化的效果。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Conclusion: 单阶段框架在城市场景中表现优异，扩散模型的应用显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Conclusion: 该框架有望革新阿尔茨海默病的早期检测，为更及时有效的治疗铺平道路。

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

Motivation: 现实中的RLHF常因噪声或奖励监督不完美导致策略不稳定和泛化能力下降，现有方法多关注奖励去噪而忽略了价值模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，结合熵和困惑度的辅助损失以及变分信息瓶颈，增强价值模型过滤噪声和捕捉关键信息的能力。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和多轮对话任务中，VRPO在噪声奖励下表现优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 研究强调了价值模型在RLHF中的重要性，并提供了在噪声环境中实现鲁棒策略优化的实用方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Motivation: 现实世界中的挑战和实用性需求促使开发仅允许有限次策略更新的算法。

Method: B-MNL-CB扩展了分布最优设计到多类别设置，RS-MNL在对抗性生成上下文中工作。

Result: B-MNL-CB在随机生成上下文下实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，RS-MNL在对抗性上下文中实现相同遗憾。实验显示算法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在有限策略更新下表现优异，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

Motivation: 研究SGDM在动态学习率和批量大小调度下的收敛行为，为深度学习训练提供理论支持和实践指导。

Method: 引入结构更简单的Lyapunov函数，扩展理论框架以涵盖三种调度策略，并进行实验验证。

Result: 动态调度的SGDM在收敛速度上显著优于固定超参数基线，其中增加批量大小和学习率的策略表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为现代深度学习的高效稳定训练提供了统一的理论基础和实用建议。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在更宽松假设下显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Conclusion: 该方法在分子分析和结构模式发现等领域具有重要价值，因其能提供对复杂图结构的深入理解。

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Result: RegMean++在多种任务中优于RegMean，并达到先进水平。

Conclusion: RegMean++通过考虑层间依赖关系，显著提升模型合并效果。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is growing increasingly complex with the
rise of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and disaggregated architectures that
decouple components like prefill/decode (PD) or attention/FFN (AF) for
heterogeneous scaling. Existing simulators, architected for co-located, dense
models, are unable to capture the intricate system dynamics of these emerging
paradigms. We present Frontier, a high-fidelity simulator designed from the
ground up for this new landscape. Frontier introduces a unified framework to
model both co-located and disaggregated systems, providing native support for

*Eric Wallace,Olivia Watkins,Miles Wang,Kai Chen,Chris Koch*

TL;DR: 研究通过恶意微调（MFT）评估GPT-OSS在生物学和网络安全领域的最大风险，发现其性能低于前沿闭源模型，对开源模型能力提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估开源模型GPT-OSS在生物学和网络安全领域的潜在风险，为未来开源模型发布提供风险估计参考。

Method: 采用恶意微调（MFT）方法，分别在生物学（威胁创建任务）和网络安全（CTF挑战）领域训练GPT-OSS，并与闭源和开源模型对比。

Result: MFT后的GPT-OSS性能低于前沿闭源模型（如OpenAI o3），对开源模型能力提升有限。

Conclusion: 研究支持发布GPT-OSS的决定，MFT方法可为未来开源模型的风险评估提供指导。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有房价估值方法中黑盒模型缺乏可解释性或简单方法无法捕捉市场异质性的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段聚类，先基于位置特征分组，再为每个聚类分别建模（LR或GAM）。

Result: 在43,309条德国房产数据上，GAM和LR的平均绝对误差分别降低36%和58%，并揭示聚类间的模式差异。

Conclusion: 聚类特定分析提升可解释性和实用性，为房产市场参与者提供更可靠的估值。

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable
property valuations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoTox是一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）和链式思维（CoT）推理的新框架，用于多毒性预测，通过整合化学结构、生物通路和基因本体（GO）术语，提供可解释的毒性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物毒性是药物开发中的主要挑战，现有机器学习模型依赖标注数据且缺乏可解释性，难以捕捉器官特异性毒性。

Method: CoTox结合化学结构数据、生物通路和GO术语，利用GPT-4o进行逐步推理，生成可解释的毒性预测。

Result: CoTox在毒性预测上优于传统机器学习和深度学习模型，且使用IUPAC名称表示化学结构能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: CoTox展示了LLM框架在提高可解释性和支持早期药物安全性评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨解释性机器学习模型是否能进一步减少算法厌恶，或使调整功能变得多余。

Method: 通过预注册用户研究（280名参与者），比较调整性和透明性对算法厌恶的影响。

Result: 调整性显著减少算法厌恶，透明性影响较小且不显著。两者效果相对独立。

Conclusion: 调整性是减少算法厌恶的有效方法，而透明性的作用有限，两者效果独立。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提供一种透明且物理基础明确的替代方案，以解决深度学习模型在可解释性和数据效率方面的不足。

Method: 通过有理谱近似将时域信号转换为稀疏的物理意义明确的谱表示，并通过核投影函数映射为符号谓词，结合基于规则的推理引擎进行逻辑推断。

Result: 在时间序列异常检测、符号分类和混合推理任务中表现出竞争力，同时保持可解释性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该架构为物理信息驱动的、具备推理能力的机器学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AS-Softmax的改进方法，解决了传统Softmax在分类任务中训练目标与测试目标不匹配的问题，通过自适应稀疏化和梯度累积策略提升了训练效率和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Softmax在训练过程中无法达到目标类的理想分数1，导致训练持续且容易过拟合。此外，训练目标与测试目标不匹配，浪费资源在已正确分类的样本上。

Method: 提出AS-Softmax，通过稀疏化处理丢弃低分无关类，专注于目标类与其强对手的区分。同时引入自适应梯度累积策略加速训练。

Result: 在多种任务（文本多类、多标签、图像分类等）中，AS-Softmax均优于传统Softmax及其变体，且训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax通过匹配测试目标的设计和自适应策略，显著提升了分类性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Motivation: 尽管扩展定律在计算机视觉和自然语言处理中取得了显著进展，但其在DRL中的应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，系统分析如何通过扩展策略提升DRL的决策性能。

Method: 从数据、网络和训练预算三个维度分析扩展策略：数据扩展（并行采样、数据生成）、网络扩展（架构增强、MoE方法）、训练预算扩展（分布式训练、大批次训练）。

Result: 综述表明，扩展策略在提升DRL性能方面具有潜力，但需平衡计算效率。

Conclusion: 本文为DRL的未来研究提供了路线图，强调在机器人控制、自动驾驶等任务中充分利用扩展潜力的重要性。

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Result: 首次为Heun采样器推导Wasserstein收敛界，并改进了Euler采样器的结果。

Conclusion: 空间规律性和分数误差控制对扩散生成模型的收敛性至关重要，平滑Wasserstein距离有助于优化初始化误差分析。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Conclusion: 强调了网络深度在分离与鲁棒性权衡中的重要性。

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

Motivation: 现有MU方法缺乏统计保证且计算成本高，需改进以满足数据隐私需求。

Method: 基于Conformal Prediction定义MU，提出ECF和EuCF指标，并设计优化这些指标的实用方法。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效移除目标数据。

Conclusion: 新方法为MU提供了统计保证和高效性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

Motivation: 数字广告平台中的RTB系统因广告主异质性（预算和ROI目标差异大）导致传统自动竞价方法效率低下，无法适应多约束环境。

Method: 提出HALO方法，利用后见机制将探索数据重新用于训练，并通过B样条函数实现跨约束空间的连续竞价映射。

Result: 在工业数据集上，HALO显著减少了约束违规并提升了GMV。

Conclusion: HALO在多约束竞价环境中表现出色，为广告平台提供了更高效的自动竞价解决方案。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Conclusion: HKGE模型的性能优势部分源于基础KGE模型，但当前模型在信息保留和整合上存在问题；FormerGNN为未来研究提供了潜在方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Conclusion: 该工作为在线持续学习在图上的研究提供了明确的方向和评估标准。

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Conclusion: 研究为假设检验框架下的策略性互动提供了全面的视角，具有技术和监管意义。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理信息的神经算子（PINO）框架，用于从稀疏测量数据中重建非线性海浪场，无需训练时的真实数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时预测相位分辨的海浪场是一个关键但未解决的问题，主要因为缺乏从稀疏或间接测量中重建初始条件的实用方法。

Method: 通过将海洋重力波的自由表面边界条件的残差嵌入PINO的损失函数中，以软约束方式限制解空间。

Result: 验证表明，PINO能够从浮标时间序列和雷达快照中准确重建非线性海浪场。

Conclusion: PINO实现了准确、实时的重建，并在广泛的海浪条件下表现出鲁棒性，为实际海洋环境中的数据驱动海浪重建和预测铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了表格数据任务中的公平性问题，发现现有方法以零和方式运作，并提出了一种仅针对弱势群体的方法以避免负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证表格数据任务中是否存在公平性方法中的“拉平效应”，并探索更优的解决方案。

Method: 评估了八种偏差缓解方法，涵盖44个任务和五个真实数据集，同时测试了一种仅针对弱势群体的新方法。

Result: 结果显示现有方法以零和方式运作，而新方法有望在不影响优势群体或整体性能的情况下提升弱势群体的利益。

Conclusion: 研究为公平性改进提供了新思路，可能推动偏差缓解方法的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ是一种基于度量的后训练量化框架，用于在极低比特压缩下保持子7B模型的准确性，通过层间诊断自动分配比特宽度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通常存在过度配置问题，许多层贡献有限却占用大量内存和能源，LieQ旨在解决低比特压缩下的准确性挑战。

Method: 引入三种层间诊断指标（困惑度下降、表示紧凑性和Top-k能量增益），实现无需梯度更新的自动比特宽度分配。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B上，2.05比特量化恢复95.9%的FP16性能，优于GPTQ和AWQ；在LLaMA3.2-3B上，2.07比特量化保持98.2%准确性，实现4倍内存减少。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限的边缘设备部署小型语言模型提供了新范式，实现了压缩与准确性的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的TDS方法在提取关键参数（如陷阱结合能和密度）时存在挑战，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 开发了一个多神经网络模型，包括分类网络（预测陷阱类型数量）和回归网络（预测陷阱密度和结合能），并优化了架构和超参数以减少训练数据需求。

Result: 模型在三种不同成分的回火马氏体钢上表现出强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为氢陷阱参数的直接预测提供了高效工具，并公开了代码。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分类方法在实时健康监测中需要持续标注的问题，提供个性化、非侵入式的健康监控方案。

Method: 使用UniTS时间序列模型，融合多源传感器数据，通过异常检测而非分类实现实时监测。

Result: 在ECG和消费级设备上表现优于12种现有方法，F1分数提升约22%。

Conclusion: 系统成功应用于家庭环境，证明无需临床设备即可实现高质量健康监测，并通过LLM增强结果可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物发现过程中数据、专业知识和工具的分散导致设计周期缓慢，因此需要一种自动化框架来加速分子优化。

Method: 采用分层智能体框架，包括数据库代理、AI专家、药物化学家、排名代理和科学评论家，通过工具调用和简洁的溯源记录实现协作。

Result: 多智能体设置显著提高了预测结合亲和力（31%），而单智能体在药物性质上表现更好。无指导的LLM运行最快但缺乏透明性。

Conclusion: 通过测试时间扩展、反馈循环和溯源记录，通用LLM可转化为可审计的分子设计系统，未来可扩展工具集以进一步优化发现流程。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单轮任务（如数学推理），而现实问题（如软件工程）需要多轮交互。论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用改进的Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)算法，基于Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct模型训练智能体。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中，成功率从20%提升至39%，并在SWE-rebench中表现优于其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开源模型构建更强大的自主智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

TL;DR: SLA-MORL是一个基于多目标强化学习的框架，用于动态分配云环境中的GPU和CPU资源，以平衡训练时间、成本和SLA合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态资源分配或单目标优化方法容易导致SLA违规或资源浪费，无法满足现代机器学习工作负载的需求。

Method: SLA-MORL采用智能初始化和动态权重调整技术，通过21维状态表示和9种可能的动作，实现资源的高效分配。

Result: 在13种不同ML工作负载上，SLA-MORL显著减少了训练时间（67.2%）、成本（68.8%）并提高了SLA合规性（73.4%）。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL通过解决冷启动和动态适应问题，为云资源管理提供了高效、平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

TL;DR: MoKA提出了一种新的Kronecker适配器，通过混合Kronecker乘积和门控机制提升表达力，同时保持参数高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低秩适配器因秩限制导致的表达能力不足问题。

Method: 使用混合Kronecker乘积建模权重更新，引入门控机制和硬件优化计算。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B和LLaMA3-8B上，MoKA性能优于基线，参数减少27倍。

Conclusion: MoKA在性能和参数效率间实现了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: VRPRM通过视觉推理和两阶段训练策略，以较低的数据标注成本提升PRM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，且CoT-PRM数据标注成本高。

Method: 提出VRPRM，结合视觉推理，设计两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅用少量数据，VRPRM性能超越传统PRM，相对提升达118%。

Conclusion: VRPRM为PRM训练提供了高效数据利用的新范式。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在超异构环境下易受投毒攻击，且高维模型扩大了攻击面，传统聚合策略效果不佳且难以检测攻击。

Method: Horus通过插入LoRA模块并仅聚合LoRA参数，利用输入投影的稳定性设计过滤机制和投影感知的聚合策略。

Result: 实验表明，Horus在多种数据集、模型架构和攻击下，鲁棒性和准确性均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Horus通过LoRA模块和针对性设计，有效解决了联邦学习在异构环境下的投毒攻击问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Result: 在12个任务中，DeepFaith在10个指标上表现最优，展示了其高效性和跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DeepFaith为XAI提供了理论上的最优解释标准，显著提升了忠实性和通用性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

Method: 利用特定解码器架构解析计算ELBO期望值，提出零方差梯度方法，并结合新颖的训练动态逐步过渡到标准随机估计器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上优于现有基线方法（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax和REINFORCE）。

Conclusion: 通过结合解析计算的稳定性和深度非线性架构的表达能力，为生成模型训练开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

TL;DR: VITA是一种基于变分推理的预训练框架，通过代理目标和自监督特征掩码解决农业产量预测中的数据不对称问题，显著提升极端天气条件下的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI模型在农业产量预测中因数据不对称（丰富预训练天气数据与有限微调数据）导致的性能不足问题。

Method: VITA利用详细天气变量作为代理目标进行预训练，并通过自监督特征掩码学习预测大气状态，仅需基本天气统计数据进行微调。

Result: 在美国玉米带的763个县中，VITA在玉米和大豆产量预测中表现最优，尤其在极端天气年份显著优于其他模型（p≈0.01）。

Conclusion: VITA通过领域感知的AI设计克服数据限制，为气候变化下的农业预测提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

TL;DR: SolarSeer是一种基于AI的快速太阳能辐照度预测模型，比传统数值天气预报快1500倍，并显著降低预测误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报（NWP）计算成本高且依赖复杂物理模拟，需要更高效的预测方法以支持太阳能系统的安全经济运行。

Method: SolarSeer通过端到端AI模型，直接利用历史卫星观测数据生成未来预测，避免了数据同化和偏微分方程求解的计算开销。

Result: SolarSeer比HRRR模型在辐照度预测上误差减少27.28%（再分析数据）和15.35%（1800个站点），并显著提升波动预测精度。

Conclusion: SolarSeer的高效和准确性为可持续能源系统的过渡提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

TL;DR: 论文通过比较随机选择特征与特征选择算法的性能，发现高维数据（如基因表达）分类任务中特征选择效果有限，随机选择的小子集性能相当或更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证特征选择算法在高维数据集（如基因表达）中的实际效果，挑战现有研究的结论。

Method: 测试随机选择特征与特征选择算法选出的特征在分类任务中的性能对比。

Result: 随机选择的小子集（0.02%-1%）性能与全特征相当或更优，挑战了现有特征选择研究的有效性。

Conclusion: 高维数据分类任务中特征选择效果有限，需谨慎对待基于计算选择基因的研究结论。

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动定理证明的性能，通过创新方法解决模型训练中的多样性下降和复杂度挑战。

Method: 采用专家迭代和强化学习流程，结合合成数据生成、验证器引导的自校正和模型平均技术。

Result: 小模型Goedel-Prover-V2-8B在MiniF2F上达到84.6% pass@32，旗舰模型Goedel-Prover-V2-32B在自校正模式下达到90.4%。

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2在开源定理证明模型中表现最佳，并在计算预算受限的情况下与闭源模型竞争。

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

TL;DR: MinConvLSTM和MinConvGRU是两种新型时空模型，结合了卷积循环网络的空间归纳偏置和最小化、可并行RNN的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ConvRNN模型中顺序隐藏状态更新的瓶颈问题，提升训练效率和计算性能。

Method: 将MinLSTM和MinGRU的对数域前缀和公式扩展到卷积架构，并引入指数门控机制。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes动力学和实际地理位势数据任务中，训练速度显著优于标准ConvLSTM和ConvGRU，预测误差更低。

Conclusion: 最小化循环结构与卷积输入聚合结合，为时空序列建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:

largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

Motivation: 癫痫手术需准确识别发作起始区（SOZ），但依赖专家视觉判断且患者数据分布差异大，导致机器学习模型在新患者数据上表现不稳定。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨患者问题，提升了癫痫诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Conclusion: 研究结果对模型蒸馏、模块化学习及鲁棒学习系统设计有重要意义。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

Method: 分析了多标注数据集和模拟分布，确定了在固定预算下最优的（N, K）配置。

Conclusion: 研究为机器学习实践者提供了优化数据收集的方法，以在预算内获得更可靠的评估结果。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

Conclusion: 通过合约层可以提升LLM生成内容的可验证性和合规性，同时提出功能等效性的概念。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

Conclusion: SkyGP有效解决了高斯过程在流数据中的计算和存储限制，适用于实时控制等场景。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

Result: 实验表明，PAC-EIG优于先前的启发式方法，并能高效识别需要进一步演示的状态。

Conclusion: PAC-EIG为主动IRL提供了首个理论保证，并在实际应用中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Abstract: We establish new algorithmic guarantees with matching hardness results for
coloring and independent set problems in one-sided expanders and related
classes of graphs. For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided
expander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative
size at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$
fraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$
with the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This
result improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)
developing an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative
size at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient
$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong
regular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\epsilon)$-factor
approximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\epsilon>0$.
  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$
matrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove
that whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem
is NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the
other hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the
corresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.
  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph
spectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The
number of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\tau$ is at most $O(1/\tau^{2})$
times the number of eigenvalues larger than $\tau^{2}/2$. While this result
allows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided
spectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic
results.

Abstract: We present a new algorithm for finding large independent sets in
$3$-colorable graphs with small $1$-sided threshold rank. Specifically, given
an $n$-vertex $3$-colorable graph whose uniform random walk matrix has at most
$r$ eigenvalues larger than $\varepsilon$, our algorithm finds a proper
$3$-coloring on at least $(\frac{1}{2}-O(\varepsilon))n$ vertices in time
$n^{O(r/\varepsilon^2)}$. This extends and improves upon the result of Bafna,
Hsieh, and Kothari on $1$-sided expanders. Furthermore, an independent work by
Buhai, Hua, Steurer, and V\'ari-Kakas shows that it is UG-hard to properly
$3$-color more than $(\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon)n$ vertices, thus establishing
the tightness of our result.
  Our proof is short and simple, relying on the observation that for any
distribution over proper $3$-colorings, the correlation across an edge must be
large if the marginals of the endpoints are not concentrated on any single
color. Notably, this property fails for $4$-colorings, which is consistent with
the hardness result of [BHK25] for $4$-colorable $1$-sided expanders.

Abstract: The reduction of the fragment assembly problem to (variations of) the
classical Eulerian trail problem [Pevzner et al., PNAS 2001] has led to
remarkable progress in genome assembly. This reduction employs the notion of de
Bruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$. A single
Eulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini
et al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX
2020] based on $z$-anonymity.
  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a
de Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function
maps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in
the reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the
latter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an
interval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the
following basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we
efficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et
al.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.
  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain
knowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the
problem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$
and $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks
[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,
highlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give
combinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the
state-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an
algorithm parametrized by $w (\log w+1) /(k-1)$. Our improved algorithm shows
that it is enough when the range of positions is small relative to $k$.
