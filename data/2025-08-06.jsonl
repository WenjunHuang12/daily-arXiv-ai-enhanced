For example, given a $3$-colorable regular one-sided\nexpander, we compute in polynomial time either an independent set of relative\nsize at least $1/2-o(1)$ or a proper $3$-coloring for all but an $o(1)$\nfraction of the vertices, where $o(1)$ stands for a function that tends to $0$\nwith the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix. This\nresult improves on recent seminal work of Bafna, Hsieh, and Kothari (STOC 2025)\ndeveloping an algorithm that efficiently finds independent sets of relative\nsize at least $0.01$ in such graphs. We also obtain an efficient\n$1.6667$-factor approximation algorithm for VERTEX COVER in sufficiently strong\nregular one-sided expanders, improving over a previous $(2-\\epsilon)$-factor\napproximation in such graphs for an unspecified constant $\\epsilon>0$.\n  We propose a new stratification of $k$-COLORING in terms of $k$-by-$k$\nmatrices akin to predicate sets for constraint satisfaction problems. We prove\nthat whenever this matrix has repeated rows, the corresponding coloring problem\nis NP-hard for one-sided expanders under the Unique Games Conjecture. On the\nother hand, if this matrix has no repeated rows, our algorithms can solve the\ncorresponding coloring problem on one-sided expanders in polynomial time.\n  As starting point for our algorithmic results, we show a property of graph\nspectra that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been observed before: The\nnumber of negative eigenvalues smaller than $-\\tau$ is at most $O(1/\\tau^{2})$\ntimes the number of eigenvalues larger than $\\tau^{2}/2$. While this result\nallows us to bound the number of eigenvalues bounded away from $0$ in one-sided\nspectral expanders, this property alone is insufficient for our algorithmic\nresults."}

This reduction employs the notion of de\nBruijn graph $G=(V,E)$ of order $k$ over an alphabet $\\Sigma$. A single\nEulerian trail in $G$ represents a candidate genome reconstruction. Bernardini\net al. have also introduced the complementary idea in data privacy [ALENEX\n2020] based on $z$-anonymity.\n  The pressing question is: How hard is it to reconstruct a best string from a\nde Bruijn graph given a function that models domain knowledge? Such a function\nmaps every length-$k$ string to an interval of positions where it may occur in\nthe reconstructed string. By the above reduction to de Bruijn graphs, the\nlatter function translates into a function $c$ mapping every edge to an\ninterval where it may occur in an Eulerian trail. This gives rise to the\nfollowing basic problem on graphs: Given an instance $(G,c)$, can we\nefficiently compute an Eulerian trail respecting $c$? Hannenhalli et\nal.~[CABIOS 1996] formalized this problem and showed that it is NP-complete.\n  We focus on parametrization aiming to capture the quality of our domain\nknowledge in the complexity. Ben-Dor et al. developed an algorithm to solve the\nproblem on de Bruijn graphs in $O(m \\cdot w^{1.5} 4^{w})$ time, where $m=|E|$\nand $w$ is the maximum interval length over all edges. Bumpus and Meeks\n[Algorithmica 2023] rediscovered the same algorithm on temporal graphs,\nhighlighting the relevance of this problem in other contexts. We give\ncombinatorial insights that lead to exponential-time improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art. For the important class of de Bruijn graphs, we develop an\nalgorithm parametrized by $w (\\log w+1) /(k-1)$.

Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT\ntechniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT\nmethods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized\napplications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify\nuncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically\nadapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations.

The major problem of GED is that its computation\nis NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation\nmethods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these\nNN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit\noperations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this\nwork, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED\nusing both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,\nit employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization\nwithout ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture\nis the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible\nand interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs.

Then the model could focus on\nlearning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is\nalso the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of\neasy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive\ngradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up\ntraining. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,\ntext multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio\nclassification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show\nthat AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss\nof AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in\nvalidation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring\nabout 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while\nmaintaining classification effectiveness."}

While these fields have witnessed\nbreakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and\nadvanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its\npotential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for\ndecision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by\nsystematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,\nand training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data\nefficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the\nrelationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we\ninvestigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,\nensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which\ncollectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational\nchallenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of\ndistributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary\ntraining on training efficiency and convergence.

It consists of: (1) High-Precision\nScoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to\nresolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware\nRetrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to\nquantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple\nmodels with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate\nthat HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately\nrecovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and\nreliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals."}

Our approach extends\nthe log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional\narchitectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized\nspatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates\nduring teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In\naddition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM\narchitecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain\ncomputation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,\nwith reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models\non two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world\ngeopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly\noutperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs.

Inverse reinforcement\nlearning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from\ndemonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice\npolicy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like\nautonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we\nneed not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal\nguarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability\nguarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically\nselecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce\nPAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets\nprobably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --\nproviding the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert\ndemonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the\napprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further\ndemonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the\nreward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,\nwe prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic\nmethods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally."}

In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender\nsystems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from\nonline streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to\ndifferent recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream\ntasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational\nconstraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert\nParadigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale\nrecommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,\ncross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This\nknowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,\nsurface-specific ``expert\" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to\nadapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.\nTo meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a\nproduction-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,\nlogging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm.

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not\ninterpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in\nneurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We\nfirst identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical\nreasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic\nreasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach\ncomprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,\nperforms symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on\ndomain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on\ndomain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there\nhas not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the\nfollowing question: Which approach is more promising for developing general\nlogical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class\ndomain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses\nthe integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the\nhybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each\napproach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising\nfor developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is\nmore interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of\nexisting LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a\ngeneralizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,\nmodel-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input."}
