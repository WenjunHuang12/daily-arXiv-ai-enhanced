### [1] [AgenticData: An Agentic Data Analytics System for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05002)
*Ji Sun,Guoliang Li,Peiyao Zhou,Yihui Ma,Jingzhe Xu,Yuan Li*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: AgenticData是一种创新的数据分析系统，通过自然语言查询自主分析多领域数据，显著提升效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有非结构化数据分析系统依赖专家编写代码和管理复杂工作流的高成本与耗时问题。

Method: 采用反馈驱动的规划技术将自然语言查询转换为语义计划，结合多代理协作策略（数据剖析代理、语义交叉验证代理和智能记忆代理）和语义优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，AgenticData在简单和复杂任务上均表现出卓越的准确性，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AgenticData通过自主分析和优化，为非结构化数据分析提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing unstructured data analytics systems rely on experts to write code
and manage complex analysis workflows, making them both expensive and
time-consuming. To address these challenges, we introduce AgenticData, an
innovative agentic data analytics system that allows users to simply pose
natural language (NL) questions while autonomously analyzing data sources
across multiple domains, including both unstructured and structured data.
First, AgenticData employs a feedback-driven planning technique that
automatically converts an NL query into a semantic plan composed of relational
and semantic operators. We propose a multi-agent collaboration strategy by
utilizing a data profiling agent for discovering relevant data, a semantic
cross-validation agent for iterative optimization based on feedback, and a
smart memory agent for maintaining short-term context and long-term knowledge.
Second, we propose a semantic optimization model to refine and execute semantic
plans effectively. Our system, AgenticData, has been tested using three
benchmarks. Experimental results showed that AgenticData achieved superior
accuracy on both easy and difficult tasks, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods.

### [2] [Making Prompts First-Class Citizens for Adaptive LLM Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05012)
*Ugur Cetintemel,Shu Chen,Alexander W. Lee,Deepti Raghavan*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SPEAR是一种语言和运行时系统，旨在通过结构化、自适应和将提示作为执行模型的一等公民来解决现代LLM管道中提示管理的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM管道中，提示作为核心元素仍是不透明且脆弱的字符串，与数据流脱节，限制了复用、优化和运行时控制。

Method: SPEAR提供了一种提示代数，支持运行时提示动态调整（基于置信度、延迟等信号）和结构化提示管理（版本化视图、日志支持）。

Result: 初步实验量化了不同调整模式与静态提示和代理重试的对比，以及提示级优化（如操作符融合）的效果。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过结构化提示管理，提升了LLM管道的灵活性、优化能力和控制力。

Abstract: Modern LLM pipelines increasingly resemble data-centric systems: they
retrieve external context, compose intermediate outputs, validate results, and
adapt based on runtime feedback. Yet, the central element guiding this process
-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the
surrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime
control.
  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a
language and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts
structured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR
enables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in
response to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing
context; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments
into versioned views with support for introspection and logging.
  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and
adapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,
assisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and
automation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables
optimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.
Preliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes
compared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of
prompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.

### [3] [Data-Aware Socratic Query Refinement in Database Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05061)
*Ruiyuan Zhang,Chrysanthi Kosyfaki,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DASG是一种基于对话的查询增强框架，通过交互式澄清解决自然语言查询的歧义，仅在预期执行成本降低超过交互开销时提问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言查询中的歧义问题，提升查询精度，同时保持效率。

Method: 结合语义相关性、目录信息增益和潜在成本降低选择最优澄清问题。

Result: 在三个数据集上评估，DASG提高了查询精度且保持高效。

Conclusion: DASG建立了一种协作分析范式，系统主动参与查询制定而非被动翻译用户请求。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Data-Aware Socratic Guidance (DASG), a
dialogue-based query enhancement framework that embeds \linebreak interactive
clarification as a first-class operator within database systems to resolve
ambiguity in natural language queries. DASG treats dialogue as an optimization
decision, asking clarifying questions only when the expected execution cost
reduction exceeds the interaction overhead. The system quantifies ambiguity
through linguistic fuzziness, schema grounding confidence, and projected costs
across relational and vector backends. Our algorithm selects the optimal
clarifications by combining semantic relevance, catalog-based information gain,
and potential cost reduction. We evaluate our proposed framework on three
datasets. The results show that DASG demonstrates improved query precision
while maintaining efficiency, establishing a cooperative analytics paradigm
where systems actively participate in query formulation rather than passively
translating user requests.

### [4] [NAEx: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Explaining Network Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04731)
*Shruti Saxena,Arijit Khan,Joydeep Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAEx是一个模型无关的框架，用于解释网络对齐模型的决策，通过识别关键子图和特征来提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络对齐模型的可解释性有限，难以理解其决策，尤其是在高风险领域。

Method: NAEx通过可学习的边和特征掩码联合参数化图结构和特征空间，并引入优化目标确保解释忠实于原始预测。

Result: NAEx在基准数据集上表现出高效性和有效性，并与四种代表性网络对齐模型集成。

Conclusion: NAEx为网络对齐模型提供了可解释性，帮助理解决策并增强信任。

Abstract: Network alignment (NA) identifies corresponding nodes across multiple
networks, with applications in domains like social networks, co-authorship, and
biology. Despite advances in alignment models, their interpretability remains
limited, making it difficult to understand alignment decisions and posing
challenges in building trust, particularly in high-stakes domains. To address
this, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that
explains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing
predictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint
cross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly
parameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and
feature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures
explanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable
meaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between
networks. NAEx is an inductive framework that efficiently generates NA
explanations for previously unseen data. We introduce evaluation metrics
tailored to alignment explainability and demonstrate NAEx's effectiveness and
efficiency on benchmark datasets by integrating it with four representative NA
models.

### [5] [LumiGen: An LVLM-Enhanced Iterative Framework for Fine-Grained Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04732)
*Xiaoqi Dong,Xiangyu Zhou,Nicholas Evans,Yujia Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LumiGen是一个基于LVLM的迭代框架，通过智能提示解析和视觉反馈优化，显著提升了T2I模型在复杂指令和细粒度控制方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了进展，但在处理复杂指令、细粒度内容控制和语义一致性方面仍存在挑战。

Method: LumiGen结合了智能提示解析与增强（IPPA）模块和迭代视觉反馈与优化（IVFR）模块，通过LVLM驱动的闭环反馈机制优化图像生成。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I基准测试中，LumiGen以3.08的平均分数优于现有方法，尤其在文本渲染和姿势表达方面表现突出。

Conclusion: LVLM的集成显著提升了图像生成的可控性和质量，验证了LumiGen框架的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has made significant advancements with
diffusion models, yet challenges persist in handling complex instructions,
ensuring fine-grained content control, and maintaining deep semantic
consistency. Existing T2I models often struggle with tasks like accurate text
rendering, precise pose generation, or intricate compositional coherence.
Concurrently, Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities in cross-modal understanding and instruction following. We propose
LumiGen, a novel LVLM-enhanced iterative framework designed to elevate T2I
model performance, particularly in areas requiring fine-grained control,
through a closed-loop, LVLM-driven feedback mechanism. LumiGen comprises an
Intelligent Prompt Parsing & Augmentation (IPPA) module for proactive prompt
enhancement and an Iterative Visual Feedback & Refinement (IVFR) module, which
acts as a "visual critic" to iteratively correct and optimize generated images.
Evaluated on the challenging LongBench-T2I Benchmark, LumiGen achieves a
superior average score of 3.08, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, our framework demonstrates significant improvements in critical
dimensions such as text rendering and pose expression, validating the
effectiveness of LVLM integration for more controllable and higher-quality
image generation.

Method: 开发MissMecha工具包，支持数值和分类特征，提供可视化诊断、MCAR测试工具和类型感知的插补评估指标。

Result: MissMecha为研究人员和从业者提供了一个统一的平台，支持数据质量研究、基准测试和教育。

Conclusion: MissMecha填补了现有工具的不足，为处理混合类型缺失数据提供了全面支持。

analysis. However, existing tools are fragmented, mechanism-limited, and
typically focus only on numerical variables, overlooking the heterogeneous
nature of real-world tabular data. We present MissMecha, an open-source Python
toolkit for simulating, visualizing, and evaluating missing data under MCAR,
MAR, and MNAR assumptions. MissMecha supports both numerical and categorical
features, enabling mechanism-aware studies across mixed-type tabular datasets.
It includes visual diagnostics, MCAR testing utilities, and type-aware
imputation evaluation metrics. Designed to support data quality research,
benchmarking, and education,MissMecha offers a unified platform for researchers
and practitioners working with incomplete data.

### [7] [Edge-Assisted Collaborative Fine-Tuning for Multi-User Personalized Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04745)
*Nan Li,Wanting Yang,Marie Siew,Zehui Xiong,Binbin Chen,Shiwen Mao,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于集群感知的分层联邦聚合框架，用于高效、个性化的边缘AIGC服务，解决了隐私、效率和通信成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在边缘设备上计算资源需求高，云端解决方案在隐私、个性化和通信成本方面存在不足。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）进行本地微调，基于任务相似性聚类客户端，并通过分层联邦聚合实现个性化与知识共享。

Result: 框架在边缘约束下加速收敛，支持可扩展的多用户个性化AIGC服务。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护、效率提升和个性化内容生成方面表现出色，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful tools for high-quality
content generation, yet their intensive computational requirements for
inference pose challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. Cloud-based
solutions aid in computation but often fall short in addressing privacy risks,
personalization efficiency, and communication costs in multi-user edge-AIGC
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we first analyze existing edge-AIGC applications
in personalized content synthesis, revealing their limitations in efficiency
and scalability. We then propose a novel cluster-aware hierarchical federated
aggregation framework. Based on parameter-efficient local fine-tuning via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the framework first clusters clients based on the
similarity of their uploaded task requirements, followed by an intra-cluster
aggregation for enhanced personalization at the server-side. Subsequently, an
inter-cluster knowledge interaction paradigm is implemented to enable
hybrid-style content generation across diverse clusters.Building upon federated
learning (FL) collaboration, our framework simultaneously trains personalized
models for individual users at the devices and a shared global model enhanced
with multiple LoRA adapters on the server,enabling efficient edge inference;
meanwhile, all prompts for clustering and inference are encoded prior to
transmission, thereby further mitigating the risk of plaintext leakage. Our
evaluations demonstrate that the framework achieves accelerated convergence
while maintaining practical viability for scalable multi-user personalized AIGC
services under edge constraints.

### [8] [A Foundational Multi-Modal Model for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04746)
*Pengtao Dang,Tingbo Guo,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大型多模态模型（LMMM）的小样本学习（FSL）方法，通过多模态数据集M3FD和新框架M3F，显著提升了FSL模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学、环境科学等领域，样本稀缺且数据收集成本高，传统小样本学习方法泛化能力有限。

Method: 构建了多模态数据集M3FD（包含10K+样本），并开发了M3F框架，通过模块化流程支持多种科学数据类型。

Result: M3F框架显著提升了小样本学习模型的性能，优于传统元学习方法。

Conclusion: M3FD和M3F为数据稀缺的科学领域提供了统一、可扩展的解决方案，降低了应用LMMM的门槛。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a machine learning paradigm that aims to
generalize models from a small number of labeled examples, typically fewer than
10 per class. FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,
materials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data
collection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically
constrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by
demonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of
independent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,
can substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming
models based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To
support this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,
over 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,
tabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such
as classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot
learning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for
data-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of
scientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on
M3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL
deployment. The source code is located at https://github.com/ptdang1001/M3F. To
democratize access to complex FSL data and promote reproducibility for public
usage, M3FD is paired with a flexible and user-friendly tool that enables
efficient querying, task-specific sampling, and preprocessing. Together, our
dataset and framework offer a unified, scalable solution that significantly
lowers the barrier to applying LMMMs in data-scarce scientific domains.

### [9] [AttriLens-Mol: Attribute Guided Reinforcement Learning for Molecular Property Prediction with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04748)
*Xuan Lin,Long Chen,Yile Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AttriLens-Mol是一种基于属性引导的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在分子属性预测任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在分子属性预测中依赖人工设计的提示和思维链模板，推理过程冗长且缺乏相关性。

Method: AttriLens-Mol通过三种奖励机制（格式奖励、计数奖励和合理性奖励）引导模型生成结构化输出，避免无关属性，并验证属性相关性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在7B规模的模型上显著提升了性能，优于监督微调模型和先进模型，且提取的属性用于决策树模型时表现更优。

Conclusion: AttriLens-Mol能有效提取相关分子属性，提升预测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting molecular
property prediction tasks but often rely on human-crafted prompts and
chain-of-thought templates. While recent advanced large reasoning models like
DeepSeek-R1 employ reinforcement learning for an extended ``thinking'' process,
their reasoning can be verbose and lack relevance. We introduce AttriLens-Mol,
an attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property
prediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)
a format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count
reward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward
using advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated
attributes. This approach implicitly elicits the model's inherent knowledge of
relevant molecular attributes during reasoning, enables making predictions for
the molecular property more effectively. Experiments on both in-distribution
and out-of-distribution datasets show that, training both 7B-size
R1-Distilled-Qwen2.5 and R1-Distilled-LLaMA3.1 models on 4,000 samples with our
proposed AttriLens-Mol method significantly boosts the performance, getting
comparable or better results than supervised fine-tuning models
(Mol-Instructions, ChemDFM, etc.) and advanced models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-V3, DeepSeek-R1, etc.). Further, our extracted attributes for the
target property, when used as features for an interpretable decision tree
model, yield superior performance compared to attributes generated by prompting
LLMs. This shows that AttriLens-Mol effectively elicits more relevant and
predictive molecular attributes, leading to enhanced interpretability and
performance for property prediction. We release the code in
https://github.com/szu-tera/AttriLens-Mol.

### [10] [PA-RNet: Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04750)
*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PA-RNet提出了一种针对多模态时间序列预测中文本干扰的鲁棒框架，通过扰动感知模块和跨模态注意力机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态时间序列数据中的文本干扰（如噪声或不一致内容）会显著降低模型性能，现有方法常忽略这一问题。

Method: PA-RNet采用扰动感知投影模块和跨模态注意力机制，分离噪声并保留语义信息，同时理论证明其稳定性和误差降低能力。

Result: 实验表明PA-RNet在多种领域和时间设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PA-RNet为多模态时间序列预测中的文本干扰问题提供了有效解决方案，具有理论和实践优势。

Abstract: In real-world applications, multimodal time series data often suffer from
interference, especially in the textual modality. Existing methods for
multimodal time series forecasting often neglect the inherent perturbations
within textual data, where irrelevant, noisy, or ambiguous content can
significantly degrade model performance, particularly when the noise exhibits
varying intensity or stems from structural inconsistencies. To address this
challenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for
Multimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.
PA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal
attention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings
while maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing
the model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz
continuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the
proposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering
strong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions. Furthermore, we
introduce a textual perturbation pipeline that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing multimodal time series forecasting tasks, allowing for systematic
evaluation of the model's robustness in the presence of varying levels of
textual noise. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and temporal
settings demonstrate that PA-RNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines.

### [11] [InfoQ: Mixed-Precision Quantization via Global Information Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04753)
*Mehmet Emre Akbulut,Hazem Hesham Yousef Shalby,Fabrizio Pittorino,Manuel Roveri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoQ是一种无需训练的混合精度量化框架，通过单次前向传播评估层敏感度，优化比特分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算昂贵的搜索或局部启发式代理，无法捕捉量化误差的全局影响。

Method: 通过量化每层并测量后续层互信息变化，将比特分配建模为整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在MobileNetV2和ResNet18上实现高压缩率（14X和10.66X），准确率提升1%。

Conclusion: InfoQ在搜索效率和准确性上优于现有方法，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) is crucial for deploying deep neural
networks on resource-constrained devices, but finding the optimal bit-width for
each layer represents a complex combinatorial optimization problem. Current
state-of-the-art methods rely on computationally expensive search algorithms or
local sensitivity heuristic proxies like the Hessian, which fail to capture the
cascading global effects of quantization error. In this work, we argue that the
quantization sensitivity of a layer should not be measured by its local
properties, but by its impact on the information flow throughout the entire
network. We introduce InfoQ, a novel framework for MPQ that is training-free in
the bit-width search phase. InfoQ assesses layer sensitivity by quantizing each
layer at different bit-widths and measuring, through a single forward pass, the
resulting change in mutual information in the subsequent layers. This
quantifies how much each layer quantization impacts the network information
flow. The resulting scores are used to formulate bit-width allocation as an
integer linear programming problem, which is solved efficiently to minimize
total sensitivity under a given budget (e.g., model size or BitOps). Our
retraining-free search phase provides a superior search-time/accuracy trade-off
(using two orders of magnitude less data compared to state-of-the-art methods
such as LIMPQ), while yielding up to a 1% accuracy improvement for MobileNetV2
and ResNet18 on ImageNet at high compression rates (14X and 10.66X).

*Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究评估了开源大语言模型（LLMs）在动态胰岛素剂量调整中的表现，发现其零样本推理性能可与训练过的小型神经网络强化学习代理（SRAs）媲美，但也存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习（RL）的动态治疗方案（DTRs）在临床决策中潜力巨大，但实际部署受限于工程复杂性。LLMs的隐式知识嵌入提供了一种互补方法。

Method: 在模拟的1型糖尿病环境中，比较了LLMs和SRAs的性能，重点关注零样本提示设计和临床推理能力。

Result: 精心设计的提示使较小LLMs表现与SRAs相当甚至更优，但LLMs在复杂推理中存在剂量过激等问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床工作流中需谨慎整合，建议结合提示工程、验证和混合方法以确保安全有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) hold
promise for automating complex clinical decision-making, yet their practical
deployment remains hindered by the intensive engineering required to inject
clinical knowledge and ensure patient safety. Recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior
knowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic
prompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we
rigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in
silico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference
performance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly
trained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot
prompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or
superior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,
particularly in stable patient cohorts. However, LLMs exhibit notable
limitations, such as overly aggressive insulin dosing when prompted with
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, highlighting critical failure modes including
arithmetic hallucination, temporal misinterpretation, and inconsistent clinical
logic. Incorporating explicit reasoning about latent clinical states (e.g.,
meals) yielded minimal performance gains, underscoring the current model's
limitations in capturing complex, hidden physiological dynamics solely through
textual inference. Our findings advocate for cautious yet optimistic
integration of LLMs into clinical workflows, emphasising the necessity of
targeted prompt engineering, careful validation, and potentially hybrid
approaches that combine linguistic reasoning with structured physiological
modelling to achieve safe, robust, and clinically effective decision-support
systems.

*Lin Jiang,Dahai Yu,Rongchao Xu,Tian Tang,Guang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的公平感知电力恢复策略EPOPR，通过预测优化框架平衡恢复效率和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电力恢复决策依赖请求量，导致弱势社区因请求少而恢复慢，存在不公平问题。

Method: 设计EPOPR框架，包含不确定性感知的修复时长预测和时空注意力强化学习。

Result: EPOPR平均减少停电时长3.60%，降低社区间不公平性14.19%。

Conclusion: EPOPR有效提升电力恢复的公平性和效率，适用于极端天气事件。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes,
highlights the urgent need for efficient and equitable power system
restoration. Many electricity providers make restoration decisions primarily
based on the volume of power restoration requests from each region. However,
our data-driven analysis reveals significant disparities in request submission
volume, as disadvantaged communities tend to submit fewer restoration requests.
This disparity makes the current restoration solution inequitable, leaving
these communities vulnerable to extended power outages. To address this, we aim
to propose an equity-aware power restoration strategy that balances both
restoration efficiency and equity across communities. However, achieving this
goal is challenging for two reasons: the difficulty of predicting repair
durations under dataset heteroscedasticity, and the tendency of reinforcement
learning agents to favor low-uncertainty actions, which potentially undermine
equity. To overcome these challenges, we design a predict-then-optimize
framework called EPOPR with two key components: (1) Equity-Conformalized
Quantile Regression for uncertainty-aware repair duration prediction, and (2)
Spatial-Temporal Attentional RL that adapts to varying uncertainty levels
across regions for equitable decision-making. Experimental results show that
our EPOPR effectively reduces the average power outage duration by 3.60% and
decreases inequity between different communities by 14.19% compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Haoyu Zhang,Shihao Zhang,Ian Colbert,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次为OPTQ（GPTQ）和Qronos两种PTQ算法提供了定量误差界限的理论保证，分析了OPTQ的迭代过程如何引入量化误差，并提出了非渐近2-范数误差界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管OPTQ因其计算效率和强经验性能被广泛采用，但缺乏严格的理论保证。本文旨在填补这一空白，并提供理论支持。

Method: 分析了OPTQ的迭代过程，推导了非渐近2-范数误差界限，并扩展到Qronos算法。

Result: 提出了OPTQ和Qronos的误差界限，为实践中的设计选择（如特征排序和正则化参数选择）提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 本文为OPTQ和Qronos提供了理论支持，解释了其经验优势，并为实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has become a crucial tool for reducing the
memory and compute costs of modern deep neural networks, including large
language models (LLMs). Among PTQ algorithms, the OPTQ framework-also known as
GPTQ-has emerged as a leading method due to its computational efficiency and
strong empirical performance. Despite its widespread adoption, however, OPTQ
lacks rigorous quantitative theoretical guarantees. This paper presents the
first quantitative error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic variants
of OPTQ, as well as for Qronos, a recent related state-of-the-art PTQ
algorithm. We analyze how OPTQ's iterative procedure induces quantization error
and derive non-asymptotic 2-norm error bounds that depend explicitly on the
calibration data and a regularization parameter that OPTQ uses. Our analysis
provides theoretical justification for several practical design choices,
including the widely used heuristic of ordering features by decreasing norm, as
well as guidance for selecting the regularization parameter. For the stochastic
variant, we establish stronger infinity-norm error bounds, which enable control
over the required quantization alphabet and are particularly useful for
downstream layers and nonlinearities. Finally, we extend our analysis to
Qronos, providing new theoretical bounds, for both its deterministic and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合联邦学习和持续学习的推荐系统框架F3CRec，解决了隐私保护和动态数据流下的推荐质量一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐方法难以处理非静态数据流，而持续学习方法又依赖集中式数据访问，无法满足隐私保护需求。

Method: 提出F3CRec框架，包含客户端自适应重放记忆和服务器端项目时间均值两个关键组件。

Result: 实验表明F3CRec在联邦环境下能长期保持推荐质量，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F3CRec成功整合了联邦学习和持续学习，为隐私保护的动态推荐系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the
adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling
collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated
Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle
with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation
quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec)
methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data
access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that
integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data
while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework
designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict
constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay
Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on
user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which
integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in
maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.

*Zachary Robertson,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需真实标签评估AI系统的方法，利用游戏抵抗性与输出质量的关系，证明f-互信息是唯一自然条件下游戏抵抗的机制，并在多个领域验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统评估常依赖真实标签，但真实标签难以获取，且现有方法易受对抗性操纵。论文旨在开发无需真实标签的评估机制。

Method: 通过数据处理的不可逆性，证明f-互信息是唯一游戏抵抗的机制，并比较了不同信息度量（如总变差距离）的可行性。

Result: 在10个领域中，信息论机制能完美区分忠实与策略性代理（d>0.5），且对抗性操纵鲁棒性比现有方法高10-100倍。

Conclusion: f-互信息机制在无需真实标签的评估中表现优异，尤其在压缩比为10:1时效果最佳，为AI系统评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: We develop mechanisms for evaluating AI systems without ground truth by
exploiting a connection between gaming resistance and output quality. The data
processing inequality ensures post-hoc attempts to game a metric degrades both
information content and task performance. We prove that f-mutual information
measures are the unique gaming resistant mechanisms under natural conditions,
with the overseer acting as an agent. While Shannon mutual information faces
exponential sample complexity, bounded measures like total variation distance
remain tractable. Empirically, across ten domains from translation to peer
review, all information-theoretic mechanisms achieve perfect discrimination (d
> 0.5) between faithful and strategic agents. In contrast, LLM judges exhibit
systematic evaluation inversion, preferring fabricated content over accurate
summaries. Our mechanisms show 10-100x better robustness to adversarial
manipulation than current practices. We also find performance follows an
inverted-U curve with compression ratio, peaking at 10:1 where agent responses
exhibit optimal information diversity (3 effective dimensions), giving a
bias-variance perspective on when our approach is expected to be most
effective.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCRide是一个基于多智能体强化学习的人本叫车系统，通过平衡乘客公平性和司机偏好，提升系统效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有叫车系统多关注运营商收益，忽视乘客和司机体验，HCRide旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Harmonization-oriented Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic)算法，包含多智能体竞争机制、动态Actor网络和Bi-Critic网络。

Result: 实验显示，HCRide在深圳和纽约的真实数据中，系统效率提升2.02%，公平性提升5.39%，司机偏好提升10.21%。

Conclusion: HCRide成功平衡了系统效率、乘客公平性和司机偏好，为人本叫车系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Order dispatch systems play a vital role in ride-hailing services, which
directly influence operator revenue, driver profit, and passenger experience.
Most existing work focuses on improving system efficiency in terms of operator
revenue, which may cause a bad experience for both passengers and drivers.
Hence, in this work, we aim to design a human-centered ride-hailing system by
considering both passenger fairness and driver preference without compromising
the overall system efficiency. However, it is nontrivial to achieve this target
due to the potential conflicts between passenger fairness and driver preference
since optimizing one may sacrifice the other. To address this challenge, we
design HCRide, a Human-Centered Ride-hailing system based on a novel
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm called Harmonization-oriented
Actor-Bi-Critic (Habic), which includes three major components (i.e., a
multi-agent competition mechanism, a dynamic Actor network, and a Bi-Critic
network) to optimize system efficiency and passenger fairness with driver
preference consideration. We extensively evaluate our HCRide using two
real-world ride-hailing datasets from Shenzhen and New York City. Experimental
results show our HCRide effectively improves system efficiency by 2.02%,
fairness by 5.39%, and driver preference by 10.21% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经时序点过程模型通常是自回归的，导致长范围预测效率低且误差累积。

Method: 采用连续和离散流匹配方法，联合建模事件间时间和事件类型，实现非自回归的连续时间流学习。

Result: 在六个真实世界基准测试中，模型在准确性和生成效率上显著优于自回归和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的流匹配框架为长范围标记事件序列建模提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling long horizon marked event sequences is a fundamental challenge in
many real-world applications, including healthcare, finance, and user behavior
modeling. Existing neural temporal point process models are typically
autoregressive, predicting the next event one step at a time, which limits
their efficiency and leads to error accumulation in long-range forecasting. In
this work, we propose a unified flow matching framework for marked temporal
point processes that enables non-autoregressive, joint modeling of inter-event
times and event types, via continuous and discrete flow matching. By learning
continuous-time flows for both components, our method generates coherent long
horizon event trajectories without sequential decoding. We evaluate our model
on six real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over
autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and generation
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对车载CAN网络的多阶段入侵检测框架，结合无监督异常检测和监督图学习，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAN协议缺乏内置安全性，易受网络攻击，因此需要一种高效的入侵检测方法。

Method: 采用变分图自编码器（VGAE）进行结构异常检测，并结合知识蒸馏图注意力网络（KD-GAT）进行分类，处理类不平衡问题。

Result: 在六个公共CAN数据集上测试，平均F1分数提升16.2%，参数减少96%。

Conclusion: 该框架在检测性能和效率上优于现有方法，尤其适用于高度不平衡的数据集。

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is a standard for in-vehicle
communication but remains susceptible to cyber-attacks due to its lack of
built-in security. This paper presents a multi-stage intrusion detection
framework leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised graph
learning tailored for automotive CAN traffic. Our architecture combines a
Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) for structural anomaly detection with a
Knowledge-Distilled Graph Attention Network (KD-GAT) for robust attack
classification. CAN bus activity is encoded as graph sequences to model
temporal and relational dependencies. The pipeline applies VGAE-based selective
undersampling to address class imbalance, followed by GAT classification with
optional score-level fusion. The compact student GAT achieves 96% parameter
reduction compared to the teacher model while maintaining strong predictive
performance. Experiments on six public CAN intrusion datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test--demonstrate competitive accuracy and
efficiency, with average improvements of 16.2% in F1-score over existing
methods, particularly excelling on highly imbalanced datasets with up to 55%
F1-score improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agnostics是一种语言无关的后训练管道，通过观察代码的外部行为来验证多语言代码，无需为每种语言单独设计测试基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源编程语言在LLMs中表现不佳的问题，避免为每种语言单独设计数据集和测试工具。

Method: 使用LLM将单元测试数据集转换为I/O格式，提供配置指导验证器编译和运行目标语言，并应用RLVR进行强化学习。

Result: 在五种低资源语言上显著提升模型性能，达到与更大模型相当的水平，并在多语言基准测试中创下新记录。

Conclusion: Agnostics简化了多语言代码的后训练过程，通过开源数据集和工具使其易于扩展和应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) already excel at writing code in high-resource
languages such as Python and JavaScript, yet stumble on low-resource languages
that remain essential to science and engineering. Besides the obvious shortage
of pre-training data, post-training itself is a bottleneck: every new language
seems to require new datasets, test harnesses, and reinforcement-learning (RL)
infrastructure.
  We introduce Agnostics, a language-agnostic post-training pipeline that
eliminates this per-language engineering. The key idea is to judge code solely
by its externally observable behavior, so a single verifier can test solutions
written in any language. Concretely, we (i) use an LLM to rewrite existing
unit-test datasets into an I/O format, (ii) supply a short configuration that
tells the verifier how to compile and run a target language, and (iii) apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) in a robust code
execution environment.
  Applied to five low-resource languages--Lua, Julia, R, OCaml, and
Fortran--Agnostics (1) improves Qwen-3 4B to performance that rivals other
16B-70B open-weight models; (2) scales cleanly to larger and diverse model
families (Qwen-3 8B, DeepSeek Coder 6.7B Instruct, Phi 4 Mini); and (3) for
${\le} 16$B parameter models, sets new state-of-the-art pass@1 results on
MultiPL-E and a new multi-language version LiveCodeBench that we introduce.
  We will release the language-agnostic training datasets (Ag-MBPP-X,
Ag-Codeforces-X, Ag-LiveCodeBench-X), training code, and ready-to-use
configurations, making RL post-training in any programming language as simple
as editing a short YAML file.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FNO在周期性假设和信号分析方面的局限性，引入希尔伯特变换以更好地处理因果、相位敏感和非平稳系统。

Method: 通过希尔伯特变换将输入信号映射为解析表示，显式提取瞬时振幅和相位信息，并应用谱卷积进行学习。

Result: HNO能够更有效地建模因果、相位敏感和非平稳系统的算子。

Conclusion: HNO通过结合希尔伯特变换和谱卷积，提供了一种更强大的神经算子架构，适用于更广泛的PDE问题。

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful, data-driven paradigm for
learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs).
State-of-the-art architectures, such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), have
achieved remarkable success by performing convolutions in the frequency domain,
making them highly effective for a wide range of problems. However, this method
has some limitations, including the periodicity assumption of the Fourier
transform. In addition, there are other methods of analysing a signal, beyond
phase and amplitude perspective, and provide us with other useful information
to learn an effective network. We introduce the \textbf{Hilbert Neural Operator
(HNO)}, a new neural operator architecture to address some advantages by
incorporating a strong inductive bias from signal processing. HNO operates by
first mapping the input signal to its analytic representation via the Hilbert
transform, thereby making instantaneous amplitude and phase information
explicit features for the learning process. The core learnable operation -- a
spectral convolution -- is then applied to this Hilbert-transformed
representation. We hypothesize that this architecture enables HNO to model
operators more effectively for causal, phase-sensitive, and non-stationary
systems. We formalize the HNO architecture and provide the theoretical
motivation for its design, rooted in analytic signal theory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以直接在概率测度上实现动态，以扩展对神经网络动力学的理解。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型和Wasserstein梯度流理论，推导出概率测度的训练动态，并引入GM层。

Result: GM层在简单分类任务中表现与传统全连接网络相当，但行为差异显著。

Conclusion: GM层为神经网络架构提供了新的可能性，展示了与传统层不同的动态行为。

Abstract: The mean-field theory for two-layer neural networks considers infinitely wide
networks that are linearly parameterized by a probability measure over the
parameter space. This nonparametric perspective has significantly advanced both
the theoretical and conceptual understanding of neural networks, with
substantial efforts made to validate its applicability to networks of moderate
width. In this work, we explore the opposite direction, investigating whether
dynamics can be directly implemented over probability measures. Specifically,
we employ Gaussian mixture models as a flexible and expressive parametric
family of distributions together with the theory of Wasserstein gradient flows
to derive training dynamics for such measures. Our approach introduces a new
type of layer -- the Gaussian mixture (GM) layer -- that can be integrated into
neural network architectures. As a proof of concept, we validate our proposal
through experiments on simple classification tasks, where a GM layer achieves
test performance comparable to that of a two-layer fully connected network.
Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these dynamics and demonstrate
numerically that GM layers exhibit markedly different behavior compared to
classical fully connected layers, even when the latter are large enough to be
considered in the mean-field regime.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Bidding-Aware Retrieval（BAR）的模型框架，通过将广告竞价信号整合到检索评分函数中，解决了在线广告系统中检索阶段与排名阶段不一致的问题，从而提升了平台收入和广告效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动竞价策略的普及，检索阶段无法访问实时竞价信息，导致与排名阶段的不一致，影响了平台收入和广告效果。

Method: BAR框架通过Bidding-Aware Modeling（竞价感知建模）引入竞价信号，采用单调性约束学习和多任务蒸馏确保经济一致性，并通过异步近线推理实现实时更新。此外，Task-Attentive Refinement模块选择性增强特征交互以区分用户兴趣和商业价值信号。

Result: 在阿里巴巴展示广告平台上的离线实验和全规模部署验证了BAR的有效性：平台收入提升4.32%，正向运营广告的展示量增加22.2%。

Conclusion: BAR通过解决检索与排名阶段的不一致问题，显著提升了广告系统的性能和经济效益。

Abstract: Online advertising systems typically use a cascaded architecture to manage
massive requests and candidate volumes, where the ranking stages allocate
traffic based on eCPM (predicted CTR $\times$ Bid). With the increasing
popularity of auto-bidding strategies, the inconsistency between the
computationally sensitive retrieval stage and the ranking stages becomes more
pronounced, as the former cannot access precise, real-time bids for the vast ad
corpus. This discrepancy leads to sub-optimal platform revenue and advertiser
outcomes. To tackle this problem, we propose Bidding-Aware Retrieval (BAR), a
model-based retrieval framework that addresses multi-stage inconsistency by
incorporating ad bid value into the retrieval scoring function. The core
innovation is Bidding-Aware Modeling, incorporating bid signals through
monotonicity-constrained learning and multi-task distillation to ensure
economically coherent representations, while Asynchronous Near-Line Inference
enables real-time updates to the embedding for market responsiveness.
Furthermore, the Task-Attentive Refinement module selectively enhances feature
interactions to disentangle user interest and commercial value signals.
Extensive offline experiments and full-scale deployment across Alibaba's
display advertising platform validated BAR's efficacy: 4.32% platform revenue
increase with 22.2% impression lift for positively-operated advertisements.

Motivation: 空气污染是全球性问题，传统物理模型在模拟表面臭氧趋势时存在局限性，且缺乏可解释性，无法支持决策制定。

Method: 采用不确定性感知的U-Net架构，结合贝叶斯和分位数回归方法，预测MOMO-Chem模型的表面臭氧偏差。

Result: 在北美和欧洲的2019年6月数据中验证了方法的有效性，评估了不同地面站点的适用性及土地利用信息的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效预测臭氧偏差，为政策制定和公共健康措施提供支持。

Abstract: Air pollution is a global hazard, and as of 2023, 94\% of the world's
population is exposed to unsafe pollution levels. Surface Ozone (O3), an
important pollutant, and the drivers of its trends are difficult to model, and
traditional physics-based models fall short in their practical use for scales
relevant to human-health impacts. Deep Learning-based emulators have shown
promise in capturing complex climate patterns, but overall lack the
interpretability necessary to support critical decision making for policy
changes and public health measures. We implement an uncertainty-aware U-Net
architecture to predict the Multi-mOdel Multi-cOnstituent Chemical data
assimilation (MOMO-Chem) model's surface ozone residuals (bias) using Bayesian
and quantile regression methods. We demonstrate the capability of our
techniques in regional estimation of bias in North America and Europe for June
2019. We highlight the uncertainty quantification (UQ) scores between our two
UQ methodologies and discern which ground stations are optimal and sub-optimal
candidates for MOMO-Chem bias correction, and evaluate the impact of land-use
information in surface ozone residual modeling.

Abstract: Air pollution is the world's largest environmental risk factor for human
disease and premature death, resulting in more than 6 million permature deaths
in 2019. Currently, there is still a challenge to model one of the most
important air pollutants, surface ozone, particularly at scales relevant for
human health impacts, with the drivers of global ozone trends at these scales
largely unknown, limiting the practical use of physics-based models. We employ
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network based architecture that estimate surface
ozone MOMO-Chem model residuals, referred to as model bias. We demonstrate the
potential of this technique in North America and Europe, highlighting its
ability better to capture physical model residuals compared to a traditional
machine learning method. We assess the impact of incorporating land use
information from high-resolution satellite imagery to improve model estimates.
Importantly, we discuss how our results can improve our scientific
understanding of the factors impacting ozone bias at urban scales that can be
used to improve environmental policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的水位预测对生态系统管理至关重要，但现有深度学习模型在水文学中的应用不足，且难以泛化到未见数据集。

Method: 提出RAF框架，利用历史观测数据检索类似水文事件，增强模型输入。比较了基于相似性和互信息的RAF方法。

Result: 在Everglades的真实数据上验证，RAF显著提高了水位预测的准确性。

Conclusion: RAF展示了在环境水文学中的潜力，为生态系统管理领域专家提供了自适应AI方法的参考。

Abstract: Accurate water level forecasting is crucial for managing ecosystems such as
the Everglades, a subtropical wetland vital for flood mitigation, drought
management, water resource planning, and biodiversity conservation. While
recent advances in deep learning, particularly time series foundation models,
have demonstrated success in general-domain forecasting, their application in
hydrology remains underexplored. Furthermore, they often struggle to generalize
across diverse unseen datasets and domains, due to the lack of effective
mechanisms for adaptation. To address this gap, we introduce
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a
framework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological
episodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an
external archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant
patterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and
predictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or
fine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and
mutual information-based RAF methods. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on
real-world data from the Everglades, demonstrating that the RAF framework
yields substantial improvements in water level forecasting accuracy. This study
highlights the potential of RAF approaches in environmental hydrology and paves
the way for broader adoption of adaptive AI methods by domain experts in
ecosystem management. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of machine learning models for neonatal seizure detection
is critical for clinical adoption. Current practices often rely on inconsistent
and biased metrics, hindering model comparability and interpretability.
Expert-level claims about AI performance are frequently made without rigorous
validation, raising concerns about their reliability. This study aims to
systematically evaluate common performance metrics and propose best practices
tailored to the specific challenges of neonatal seizure detection. Using real
and synthetic seizure annotations, we assessed standard performance metrics,
consensus strategies, and human-expert level equivalence tests under varying
class imbalance, inter-rater agreement, and number of raters. Matthews and
Pearson's correlation coefficients outperformed the area under the curve in
reflecting performance under class imbalance. Consensus types are sensitive to
the number of raters and agreement level among them. Among human-expert level
equivalence tests, the multi-rater Turing test using Fleiss k best captured
expert-level AI performance. We recommend reporting: (1) at least one balanced
metric, (2) Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV, (3) Multi-rater Turing test
results using Fleiss k, and (4) All the above on held-out validation set. This
proposed framework provides an important prerequisite to clinical validation by
enabling a thorough and honest appraisal of AI methods for neonatal seizure
detection.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of transfer learning has revolutionized machine
learning by enabling efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to new domains.
However, the reliability of these adaptations remains poorly understood,
particularly when using adaptive data selection strategies that dynamically
prioritize training examples. We present a comprehensive theoretical and
empirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a
mathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between
adaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the
formalization of selection sensitivity ($\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures
how adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We
prove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two
independent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than
a threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while
decreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the
MultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform
sampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical
relationship holds precisely in practice. Our results reveal that highly
adaptive strategies like gradient-based and curriculum learning achieve
superior task performance but suffer from high replicability failure rates,
while less adaptive approaches maintain failure rates below 7%. Crucially, we
show that source domain pretraining provides a powerful mitigation mechanism,
reducing failure rates by up to 30% while preserving performance gains. These
findings establish principled guidelines for practitioners to navigate the
performance-replicability trade-off and highlight the need for
replicability-aware design in modern transfer learning systems.

Conclusion: Transformer模型在仇恨言论检测中表现优异，ELECTRA尤为突出，但需进一步解决分类中的复杂语言问题。

Abstract: Hate speech is a widespread and harmful form of online discourse,
encompassing slurs and defamatory posts that can have serious social,
psychological, and sometimes physical impacts on targeted individuals and
communities. As social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook,
Instagram, Reddit, and others continue to facilitate widespread communication,
they also become breeding grounds for hate speech, which has increasingly been
linked to real-world hate crimes. Addressing this issue requires the
development of robust automated methods to detect hate speech in diverse social
media environments. Deep learning approaches, such as vanilla recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), have achieved good results, but are often limited by issues
such as long-term dependencies and inefficient parallelization. This study
represents the comprehensive exploration of transformer-based models for hate
speech detection using the MetaHate dataset--a meta-collection of 36 datasets
with 1.2 million social media samples. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art
transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2, and ELECTRA, with
fine-tuned ELECTRA achieving the highest performance (F1 score: 0.8980). We
also analyze classification errors, revealing challenges with sarcasm, coded
language, and label noise.

*Chenkai Wu,Yuanyuan Qi,Xiaohao Yang,Jueqing Lu,Gang Liu,Wray Buntine,Lan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALScope是一个新的深度主动学习平台，整合了多种数据集和算法，用于公平评估不同任务条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实应用中分布偏移和数据不平衡的挑战增多，缺乏统一平台阻碍了公平评估，因此开发了ALScope。

Method: 平台整合了10个CV和NLP数据集及21种DAL算法，支持灵活配置实验因素，如OOD样本比例和类别不平衡比例。

Result: 实验表明，DAL算法性能因领域和任务设置而异，非标准场景下仍有改进空间，部分算法性能好但耗时较长。

Conclusion: ALScope为DAL研究提供了全面评估工具，揭示了算法在不同场景下的表现和优化方向。

Abstract: Deep Active Learning (DAL) reduces annotation costs by selecting the most
informative unlabeled samples during training. As real-world applications
become more complex, challenges stemming from distribution shifts (e.g.,
open-set recognition) and data imbalance have gained increasing attention,
prompting the development of numerous DAL algorithms. However, the lack of a
unified platform has hindered fair and systematic evaluation under diverse
conditions. Therefore, we present a new DAL platform ALScope for classification
tasks, integrating 10 datasets from computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP), and 21 representative DAL algorithms, including both
classical baselines and recent approaches designed to handle challenges such as
distribution shifts and data imbalance. This platform supports flexible
configuration of key experimental factors, ranging from algorithm and dataset
choices to task-specific factors like out-of-distribution (OOD) sample ratio,
and class imbalance ratio, enabling comprehensive and realistic evaluation. We
conduct extensive experiments on this platform under various settings. Our
findings show that: (1) DAL algorithms' performance varies significantly across
domains and task settings; (2) in non-standard scenarios such as imbalanced and
open-set settings, DAL algorithms show room for improvement and require further
investigation; and (3) some algorithms achieve good performance, but require
significantly longer selection time.

*Nameer Hirschkind,Joseph Liu,Mahesh Kumar Nandwana,Xiao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为REINA的新方法，用于优化同时语音翻译（SimulST）系统的延迟与翻译质量之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SimulST系统需要在实时翻译时平衡翻译质量和延迟，现有方法难以优化这一权衡。

Method: 提出REINA损失函数，基于信息理论原则训练自适应策略，利用非流式翻译模型优化延迟与质量。

Result: 在法语、西班牙语和德语的翻译任务中，REINA实现了同类模型中的最佳性能，并将延迟/质量权衡效率提高了21%。

Conclusion: REINA显著提升了SimulST系统的性能，为实时翻译提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while
simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the
significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We
introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you
gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized
Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive
policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from
information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported
Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing
REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and
into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we
achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable
size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively
showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared
to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

*Rui Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SEA的新框架，通过分解集成误差为个体性能和多样性两部分，实现对集成性能的精细调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集成学习方法（如Bagging和Boosting）在平衡个体学习器准确性和多样性方面缺乏精确控制，NCL方法虽有改进但存在理论界限松散和调整范围有限的问题。

Method: SEA框架将集成误差分解为个体性能项和多样性项，并在损失函数中引入可调参数，实现对两部分贡献的精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，SEA在多个公共数据集上优于基线方法，具有更灵活的调整能力和更优的性能。

Conclusion: SEA通过更精细的调控机制和更紧的理论界限，显著提升了集成学习的性能。

Abstract: Ensemble learning boosts performance by aggregating predictions from multiple
base learners. A core challenge is balancing individual learner accuracy with
diversity. Traditional methods like Bagging and Boosting promote diversity
through randomness but lack precise control over the accuracy-diversity
trade-off. Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) introduces a penalty to manage
this trade-off but suffers from loose theoretical bounds and limited adjustment
range. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called
Self-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct
components: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each
base learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners. This
decomposition allows us to introduce an adjustable parameter into the loss
function, offering precise control over the contribution of each component,
thus enabling finer regulation of ensemble performance. Compared to NCL and its
variants, SEA provides a broader range of effective adjustments and more
consistent changes in diversity. Furthermore, we establish tighter theoretical
bounds for adjustable ensemble methods and validate them through empirical
experiments. Experimental results on several public regression and
classification datasets demonstrate that SEA consistently outperforms baseline
methods across all tasks. Ablation studies confirm that SEA offers more
flexible adjustment capabilities and superior performance in fine-tuning
strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种压缩去中心化算法，用于解决非凸随机优化问题，结合动量技术和消息压缩技术，实现了快速收敛和低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在去中心化算法中同时利用动量加速和压缩通信的潜力，同时控制共识误差、压缩误差和动量梯度偏差，是一个理论上的挑战。

Method: 设计了两种算法：一种针对梯度有界场景的压缩去中心化自适应方法；另一种针对数据异构场景的压缩去中心化重球方法，结合梯度跟踪技术。

Result: 两种方法均实现了最优收敛速率，并能在特定误差容忍范围内实现线性加速和拓扑无关的参数设置。

Conclusion: 实验证明，这两种方法在训练深度神经网络和Transformer时表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we design two compressed decentralized algorithms for solving
nonconvex stochastic optimization under two different scenarios. Both
algorithms adopt a momentum technique to achieve fast convergence and a
message-compression technique to save communication costs. Though momentum
acceleration and compressed communication have been used in literature, it is
highly nontrivial to theoretically prove the effectiveness of their composition
in a decentralized algorithm that can maintain the benefits of both sides,
because of the need to simultaneously control the consensus error, the
compression error, and the bias from the momentum gradient.
  For the scenario where gradients are bounded, our proposal is a compressed
decentralized adaptive method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized adaptive stochastic gradient method with compressed
communication. For the scenario of data heterogeneity without bounded
gradients, our proposal is a compressed decentralized heavy-ball method, which
applies a gradient tracking technique to address the challenge of data
heterogeneity. Notably, both methods achieve an optimal convergence rate, and
they can achieve linear speed up and adopt topology-independent algorithmic
parameters within a certain regime of the user-specified error tolerance.
Superior empirical performance is observed over state-of-the-art methods on
training deep neural networks (DNNs) and Transformers.

TL;DR: MENDR是一种基于滤波器组的EEG基础模型，通过Riemannian流形变换架构提升EEG信号的可解释性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，临床应用中需要更清晰的预训练动态和表征保留。

Method: MENDR利用离散小波包变换将EEG信号分解为多分辨率系数，学习对称正定矩阵嵌入。

Result: MENDR在多个临床EEG任务中接近最先进性能，且参数更少，支持信号重构和几何可视化。

Conclusion: MENDR为高效、可解释且适用于临床的EEG分析提供了新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) signals have recently
demonstrated success in learning generalized representations of EEGs,
outperforming specialized models in various downstream tasks. However, many of
these models lack transparency in their pretraining dynamics and offer limited
insight into how well EEG information is preserved within their embeddings. For
successful clinical integration, EEG foundation models must ensure transparency
in pretraining, downstream fine-tuning, and the interpretability of learned
representations. Current approaches primarily operate in the temporal domain,
overlooking advancements in digital signal processing that enable the
extraction of deterministic and traceable features, such as wavelet-based
representations. We propose MENDR (Manifold Explainable Neural Data
Representations), a filter bank-based EEG foundation model built on a novel
Riemannian Manifold Transformer architecture to resolve these issues. MENDR
learns symmetric positive definite matrix embeddings of EEG signals and is
pretrained on a large corpus comprising over 4,000 hours of EEG data,
decomposed via discrete wavelet packet transforms into multi-resolution
coefficients. MENDR significantly enhances interpretability by visualizing
symmetric positive definite embeddings as geometric ellipsoids and supports
accurate reconstruction of EEG signals from learned embeddings. Evaluations
across multiple clinical EEG tasks demonstrate that MENDR achieves near
state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer parameters, underscoring
its potential for efficient, interpretable, and clinically applicable EEG
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统的可靠建模具有挑战性，需要一种能够结合数据驱动方法和实时传感器数据校正的解决方案。

Result: 在基准问题和实时车辆轨迹估计任务中验证了RCUKF的有效性。

Conclusion: RCUKF为复杂系统提供了一种高效且可靠的建模方法。

Abstract: Accurate modeling is crucial in many engineering and scientific applications,
yet obtaining a reliable process model for complex systems is often
challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, reservoir
computing with unscented Kalman filtering (RCUKF), which integrates data-driven
modeling via reservoir computing (RC) with Bayesian estimation through the
unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The RC component learns the nonlinear system
dynamics directly from data, serving as a surrogate process model in the UKF
prediction step to generate state estimates in high-dimensional or chaotic
regimes where nominal mathematical models may fail. Meanwhile, the UKF
measurement update integrates real-time sensor data to correct potential drift
in the data-driven model. We demonstrate RCUKF effectiveness on well-known
benchmark problems and a real-time vehicle trajectory estimation task in a
high-fidelity simulation environment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多关系多模态因果干预模型（MMCI），通过因果理论中的后门调整解决多模态情感分析中的虚假相关性，提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态情感分析中易受虚假相关性影响，导致模型依赖统计捷径而非真实因果关系，影响泛化能力。

Method: 将多模态输入建模为多关系图，捕捉模态内和模态间依赖；使用注意力机制分离因果特征和捷径特征；通过后门调整动态结合特征以稳定预测。

Result: 在多个标准数据集和OOD测试集上验证了模型能有效抑制偏差并提升性能。

Conclusion: MMCI模型通过因果干预显著改善了多模态情感分析的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to understand human emotions by
integrating information from multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and
visual data. However, existing methods often suffer from spurious correlations
both within and across modalities, leading models to rely on statistical
shortcuts rather than true causal relationships, thereby undermining
generalization. To mitigate this issue, we propose a Multi-relational
Multimodal Causal Intervention (MMCI) model, which leverages the backdoor
adjustment from causal theory to address the confounding effects of such
shortcuts. Specifically, we first model the multimodal inputs as a
multi-relational graph to explicitly capture intra- and inter-modal
dependencies. Then, we apply an attention mechanism to separately estimate and
disentangle the causal features and shortcut features corresponding to these
intra- and inter-modal relations. Finally, by applying the backdoor adjustment,
we stratify the shortcut features and dynamically combine them with the causal
features to encourage MMCI to produce stable predictions under distribution
shifts. Extensive experiments on several standard MSA datasets and
out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets demonstrate that our method effectively
suppresses biases and improves performance.

TL;DR: R-Zero是一种完全自主的框架，通过两个独立模型的交互生成训练数据，无需依赖人工标注任务，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM训练方法依赖人工标注任务和标签，限制了AI系统超越人类智能的能力发展。

Method: R-Zero框架初始化两个独立模型（Challenger和Solver），通过交互生成任务并优化，形成自我改进的课程。

Result: R-Zero显著提升了推理能力，如在数学推理和通用领域推理基准上分别提升了6.49和7.54分。

Conclusion: R-Zero为LLM的自主进化提供了可行路径，突破了依赖人工标注的瓶颈。

Abstract: Self-evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable path toward
super-intelligence by autonomously generating, refining, and learning from
their own experiences. However, existing methods for training such models still
rely heavily on vast human-curated tasks and labels, typically via fine-tuning
or reinforcement learning, which poses a fundamental bottleneck to advancing AI
systems toward capabilities beyond human intelligence. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce R-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates
its own training data from scratch. Starting from a single base LLM, R-Zero
initializes two independent models with distinct roles, a Challenger and a
Solver. These models are optimized separately and co-evolve through
interaction: the Challenger is rewarded for proposing tasks near the edge of
the Solver capability, and the Solver is rewarded for solving increasingly
challenging tasks posed by the Challenger. This process yields a targeted,
self-improving curriculum without any pre-existing tasks and labels.
Empirically, R-Zero substantially improves reasoning capability across
different backbone LLMs, e.g., boosting the Qwen3-4B-Base by +6.49 on
math-reasoning benchmarks and +7.54 on general-domain reasoning benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，SPaRFT在多个推理基准测试中，使用最多100倍少的样本，达到或超过现有方法的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的训练课程，SPaRFT能以最小资源解锁LLMs的强大推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities when
fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL). However, such methods require
extensive data and compute, making them impractical for smaller models. Current
approaches to curriculum learning or data selection are largely
heuristic-driven or demand extensive computational resources, limiting their
scalability and generalizability. We propose \textbf{SPaRFT}, a self-paced
learning framework that enables efficient learning based on the capability of
the model being trained through optimizing which data to use and when. First,
we apply \emph{cluster-based data reduction} to partition training data by
semantics and difficulty, extracting a compact yet diverse subset that reduces
redundancy. Then, a \emph{multi-armed bandit} treats data clusters as arms,
optimized to allocate training samples based on model current performance.
Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that SPaRFT achieves
comparable or better accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using up to
\(100\times\) fewer samples. Ablation studies and analyses further highlight
the importance of both data clustering and adaptive selection. Our results
demonstrate that carefully curated, performance-driven training curricula can
unlock strong reasoning abilities in LLMs with minimal resources.

Conclusion: 眼动数据可用于AR中的SA建模，有助于设计兼顾安全与SA的AR系统。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems, while enhancing task performance through
real-time guidance, pose risks of inducing cognitive tunneling-a hyperfocus on
virtual content that compromises situational awareness (SA) in safety-critical
scenarios. This paper investigates SA in AR-guided cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), where responders must balance effective compressions with
vigilance to unpredictable hazards (e.g., patient vomiting). We developed an AR
app on a Magic Leap 2 that overlays real-time CPR feedback (compression depth
and rate) and conducted a user study with simulated unexpected incidents (e.g.,
bleeding) to evaluate SA, in which SA metrics were collected via observation
and questionnaires administered during freeze-probe events. Eye tracking
analysis revealed that higher SA levels were associated with greater saccadic
amplitude and velocity, and with reduced proportion and frequency of fixations
on virtual content. To predict SA, we propose FixGraphPool, a graph neural
network that structures gaze events (fixations, saccades) into spatiotemporal
graphs, effectively capturing dynamic attentional patterns. Our model achieved
83.0% accuracy (F1=81.0%), outperforming feature-based machine learning and
state-of-the-art time-series models by leveraging domain knowledge and
spatial-temporal information encoded in ET data. These findings demonstrate the
potential of eye tracking for SA modeling in AR and highlight its utility in
designing AR systems that ensure user safety and situational awareness.

Method: 通过逐步缩小数据集的顺序微调诱导结构化遗忘过程，并利用元学习建模权重预测，构建KNOW预测器（KNOWN）来生成知识增强的权重。

Result: 实验表明，KNOW预测在多种数据集和架构上优于朴素微调和简单权重预测，显著提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为重新解释遗忘动态提供了新视角，推动了深度学习知识传递的极限。

Abstract: Pre-trained weights have become a cornerstone of modern deep learning,
enabling efficient knowledge transfer and improving downstream task
performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios. However, a fundamental
question remains: how can we obtain better pre-trained weights that encapsulate
more knowledge beyond the given dataset? In this work, we introduce
\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that
leverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize
knowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on
progressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which
can be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger
dataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this
controlled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction
effectively. Specifically, our \textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster
(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and
predicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction
consistently outperforms Na\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,
leading to superior downstream performance. Our work provides a new perspective
on reinterpreting forgetting dynamics to push the limits of knowledge transfer
in deep learning.

Result: 在多种节点和图分类、回归任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TANGO通过联合学习能量函数和切向流，为图神经网络提供了有效的动态框架。

Abstract: We introduce TANGO -- a dynamical systems inspired framework for graph
representation learning that governs node feature evolution through a learned
energy landscape and its associated descent dynamics. At the core of our
approach is a learnable Lyapunov function over node embeddings, whose gradient
defines an energy-reducing direction that guarantees convergence and stability.
To enhance flexibility while preserving the benefits of energy-based dynamics,
we incorporate a novel tangential component, learned via message passing, that
evolves features while maintaining the energy value. This decomposition into
orthogonal flows of energy gradient descent and tangential evolution yields a
flexible form of graph dynamics, and enables effective signal propagation even
in flat or ill-conditioned energy regions, that often appear in graph learning.
Our method mitigates oversquashing and is compatible with different graph
neural network backbones. Empirically, TANGO achieves strong performance across
a diverse set of node and graph classification and regression benchmarks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly learned energy functions and
tangential flows for graph neural networks.

Conclusion: Integrated Influence提供了一种更灵活和可靠的数据归因方法，增强了机器学习模型的透明度和解释能力。

Abstract: As an effective approach to quantify how training samples influence test
sample, data attribution is crucial for understanding data and model and
further enhance the transparency of machine learning models. We find that
prevailing data attribution methods based on leave-one-out (LOO) strategy
suffer from the local-based explanation, as these LOO-based methods only
perturb a single training sample, and overlook the collective influence in the
training set. On the other hand, the lack of baseline in many data attribution
methods reduces the flexibility of the explanation, e.g., failing to provide
counterfactual explanations. In this paper, we propose Integrated Influence, a
novel data attribution method that incorporates a baseline approach. Our method
defines a baseline dataset, follows a data degeneration process to transition
the current dataset to the baseline, and accumulates the influence of each
sample throughout this process. We provide a solid theoretical framework for
our method, and further demonstrate that popular methods, such as influence
functions, can be viewed as special cases of our approach. Experimental results
show that Integrated Influence generates more reliable data attributions
compared to existing methods in both data attribution task and mislablled
example identification task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动问题在计算社会系统和经济分析中尤为突出，因为初始标注数据稀缺且昂贵。

Method: 使用PCA进行自监督预训练生成初始伪标签，随后通过主动学习循环优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个领域的数据集上优于标准主动学习策略，准确性更高且所需标注更少。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了冷启动问题，提升了偏好学习在数据受限环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Active preference learning is a powerful paradigm for efficiently modeling
preferences, yet it suffers from the cold-start problem: a significant drop in
performance when no initial labeled data is available. This challenge is
particularly acute in computational social systems and economic analysis, where
labeled data is often scarce, expensive, and subject to expert noise. To
address this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference
learning. Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised
pre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive
initial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a
cold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the
model is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a
simulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career
success rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our
cold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin
from a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled
pairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the
cold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of
preference learning in data-constrained environments. We release our code at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的弱监督学习框架，通过整合多种弱监督信号（相似性-置信度和置信度-差异）来提升模型性能，特别是在标记数据有限的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在标记数据有限且标注不准确的实际应用中，现有弱监督学习方法通常仅利用单一类型的弱监督信号，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出了SconfConfDiff分类方法，整合两种弱标签形式，并设计了两种无偏风险估计器（一种基于现有估计器的凸组合，另一种通过建模弱标签间的交互）。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多种设置下优于现有基线，理论分析表明其具有最优收敛率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多视角弱监督信号的有效整合，显著提升了弱监督学习的性能。

Abstract: In practical machine learning applications, it is often challenging to assign
accurate labels to data, and increasing the number of labeled instances is
often limited. In such cases, Weakly Supervised Learning (WSL), which enables
training with incomplete or imprecise supervision, provides a practical and
effective solution. However, most existing WSL methods focus on leveraging a
single type of weak supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel WSL
framework that leverages complementary weak supervision signals from multiple
relational perspectives, which can be especially valuable when labeled data is
limited. Specifically, we introduce SconfConfDiff Classification, a method that
integrates two distinct forms of weaklabels: similarity-confidence and
confidence-difference, which are assigned to unlabeled data pairs. To implement
this method, we derive two types of unbiased risk estimators for
classification: one based on a convex combination of existing estimators, and
another newly designed by modeling the interaction between two weak labels. We
prove that both estimators achieve optimal convergence rates with respect to
estimation error bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach
to mitigate overfitting caused by negative empirical risk, and provide
theoretical analysis on the robustness of the proposed method against
inaccurate class prior probability and label noise. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing
baselines across a variety of settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在函数调用任务中表现不佳，监督微调依赖表面模式匹配，而标准强化学习方法难以处理复杂的结构化动作空间。

Method: 采用两阶段数据准备流程，结合迭代LLM评估和抽象语法树验证，提出了一种基于熵的探索策略的强化学习框架。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了函数调用任务的性能，并表明结构化语言生成能力为强化学习提供了优势起点，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Function calling capabilities are crucial for deploying Large Language Models
in real-world applications, yet current training approaches fail to develop
robust reasoning strategies. Supervised fine-tuning produces models that rely
on superficial pattern matching, while standard reinforcement learning methods
struggle with the complex action space of structured function calls. We present
a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance group relative
policy optimization through strategic entropy based exploration specifically
tailored for function calling tasks. Our approach addresses three critical
challenges in function calling: insufficient exploration during policy
learning, lack of structured reasoning in chain-of-thought generation, and
inadequate verification of parameter extraction. Our two-stage data preparation
pipeline ensures high-quality training samples through iterative LLM evaluation
and abstract syntax tree validation. Extensive experiments on the Berkeley
Function Calling Leaderboard demonstrate that this framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with 86.02\% overall
accuracy, outperforming standard GRPO by up to 6\% on complex multi-function
scenarios. Notably, our method shows particularly strong improvements on
code-pretrained models, suggesting that structured language generation
capabilities provide an advantageous starting point for reinforcement learning
in function calling tasks. We will release all the code, models and dataset to
benefit the community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HFedATM的分层联邦域泛化方法，通过卷积滤波器对齐和正则化均值聚合，解决了分层联邦学习中的域偏移问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分层联邦学习（HFL）存在域偏移问题，导致模型在未见目标域上性能下降。现有联邦域泛化（FedDG）方法未充分探索与HFL的结合。

Method: 提出HFedATM方法，包括滤波器最优传输对齐和收缩感知正则化均值聚合，以解决域偏移并提升模型泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明HFedATM显著优于现有FedDG基线，同时保持计算和通信效率。理论分析显示其泛化误差界更紧，收敛更快。

Conclusion: HFedATM为分层联邦学习中的域偏移问题提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized approach where multiple clients
collaboratively train a shared global model without sharing their raw data.
Despite its effectiveness, conventional FL faces scalability challenges due to
excessive computational and communication demands placed on a single central
server as the number of participating devices grows. Hierarchical Federated
Learning (HFL) addresses these issues by distributing model aggregation tasks
across intermediate nodes (stations), thereby enhancing system scalability and
robustness against single points of failure. However, HFL still suffers from a
critical yet often overlooked limitation: domain shift, where data
distributions vary significantly across different clients and stations,
reducing model performance on unseen target domains. While Federated Domain
Generalization (FedDG) methods have emerged to improve robustness to domain
shifts, their integration into HFL frameworks remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we formally introduce Hierarchical Federated Domain Generalization
(HFedDG), a novel scenario designed to investigate domain shift within
hierarchical architectures. Specifically, we propose HFedATM, a hierarchical
aggregation method that first aligns the convolutional filters of models from
different stations through Filter-wise Optimal Transport Alignment and
subsequently merges aligned models using a Shrinkage-aware Regularized Mean
Aggregation. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that HFedATM
significantly boosts the performance of existing FedDG baselines across
multiple datasets and maintains computational and communication efficiency.
Moreover, theoretical analyses indicate that HFedATM achieves tighter
generalization error bounds compared to standard hierarchical averaging,
resulting in faster convergence and stable training behavior.

Method: 分析深度全连接神经网络在Sobolev空间中的逼近能力，使用常见激活函数，误差以$W^{m,p}$-范数衡量。

Result: 神经网络逼近PDE弱解的精度超越传统数值方法（如有限元和谱方法），表现出超收敛现象。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络在科学计算中的应用提供了理论支持，展示了其优越的逼近能力。

Abstract: This paper establishes a comprehensive approximation result for deep
fully-connected neural networks with commonly-used and general activation
functions in Sobolev spaces $W^{n,\infty}$, with errors measured in the
$W^{m,p}$-norm for $m < n$ and $1\le p \le \infty$. The derived rates surpass
those of classical numerical approximation techniques, such as finite element
and spectral methods, exhibiting a phenomenon we refer to as
\emph{super-convergence}. Our analysis shows that deep networks with general
activations can approximate weak solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) with superior accuracy compared to traditional numerical methods at the
approximation level. Furthermore, this work closes a significant gap in the
error-estimation theory for neural-network-based approaches to PDEs, offering a
unified theoretical foundation for their use in scientific computing.

TL;DR: PSEO框架通过优化后验堆叠集成，解决了AutoML中CASH问题，结合多样性与性能的权衡，显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML系统在后验集成阶段采用固定策略，无法适应任务特性，限制了性能提升。

Method: PSEO通过二元二次规划选择基础模型，引入多层堆叠机制，并搜索最优后验集成策略。

Result: 在80个公开数据集上，PSEO平均测试排名为2.96，优于16种现有方法。

Conclusion: PSEO通过动态优化后验集成策略，显著提升了AutoML系统的性能。

Abstract: The Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH)
problem is fundamental in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). Inspired by the
success of ensemble learning, recent AutoML systems construct post-hoc
ensembles for final predictions rather than relying on the best single model.
However, while most CASH methods conduct extensive searches for the optimal
single model, they typically employ fixed strategies during the ensemble phase
that fail to adapt to specific task characteristics. To tackle this issue, we
propose PSEO, a framework for post-hoc stacking ensemble optimization. First,
we conduct base model selection through binary quadratic programming, with a
trade-off between diversity and performance. Furthermore, we introduce two
mechanisms to fully realize the potential of multi-layer stacking. Finally,
PSEO builds a hyperparameter space and searches for the optimal post-hoc
ensemble strategy within it. Empirical results on 80 public datasets show that
\sys achieves the best average test rank (2.96) among 16 methods, including
post-hoc designs in recent AutoML systems and state-of-the-art ensemble
learning methods.

Motivation: 由于基于RL的ABMs和RABMs模型性能评估的复杂性和随机性，以及缺乏标准化的RL算法比较指标，本研究旨在开发领域驱动的RL评估指标。

Method: 研究结合了领域驱动的奖励与现有先进指标，开发了“Domain-driven-RL-metrics”，并在一个理性ABM疾病模型案例中进行了策略优化。

Conclusion: 领域驱动的RL评估指标为复杂系统的ABMs和RABMs优化提供了更全面的性能评估方法。

Abstract: For the development and optimization of agent-based models (ABMs) and
rational agent-based models (RABMs), optimization algorithms such as
reinforcement learning are extensively used. However, assessing the performance
of RL-based ABMs and RABMS models is challenging due to the complexity and
stochasticity of the modeled systems, and the lack of well-standardized metrics
for comparing RL algorithms. In this study, we are developing domain-driven
metrics for RL, while building on state-of-the-art metrics. We demonstrate our
``Domain-driven-RL-metrics'' using policy optimization on a rational ABM
disease modeling case study to model masking behavior, vaccination, and
lockdown in a pandemic. Our results show the use of domain-driven rewards in
conjunction with traditional and state-of-the-art metrics for a few different
simulation scenarios such as the differential availability of masks.

Motivation: 现有个性化联邦学习方法假设客户端静态参与，而现实中新客户端可能动态加入，这带来了性能保持和知识迁移的挑战。

Method: 提出pFedDSH框架，基于中央超网络生成个性化模型，使用批次特定掩码保护知识，并引入数据重放策略促进反向迁移。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上的实验表明，pFedDSH优于现有方法，实现了对现有客户端的稳定性能和新客户端的快速适应。

Conclusion: pFedDSH在动态客户端加入的场景下表现出色，平衡了性能稳定性和资源利用效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, offering a significant privacy
benefit. However, most existing Personalized Federated Learning (pFL) methods
assume a static client participation, which does not reflect real-world
scenarios where new clients may continuously join the federated system (i.e.,
dynamic client onboarding). In this paper, we explore a practical scenario in
which a new batch of clients is introduced incrementally while the learning
task remains unchanged. This dynamic environment poses various challenges,
including preserving performance for existing clients without retraining and
enabling efficient knowledge transfer between client batches. To address these
issues, we propose Personalized Federated Data-Free Sub-Hypernetwork (pFedDSH),
a novel framework based on a central hypernetwork that generates personalized
models for each client via embedding vectors. To maintain knowledge stability
for existing clients, pFedDSH incorporates batch-specific masks, which activate
subsets of neurons to preserve knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free
replay strategy motivated by DeepInversion to facilitate backward transfer,
enhancing existing clients' performance without compromising privacy. Extensive
experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate
that pFedDSH outperforms the state-of-the-art pFL and Federated Continual
Learning baselines in our investigation scenario. Our approach achieves robust
performance stability for existing clients, as well as adaptation for new
clients and efficient utilization of neural resources.

TL;DR: S$^2$M-Former是一种新型的尖峰对称混合框架，用于解决听觉注意力检测（AAD）中的能量效率问题，通过生物启发的架构和轻量级设计，显著降低了能耗并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EEG-based AAD缺乏能够充分利用互补EEG特征且满足能量效率限制的协同框架。

Method: 提出S$^2$M-Former，采用尖峰驱动的对称架构和轻量级1D令牌序列，减少参数和能耗。

Result: 在三个AAD基准测试中表现优异，能耗降低5.8倍，参数减少14.7倍，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: S$^2$M-Former是一种高效、低功耗的AAD解决方案，具有潜在的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Auditory attention detection (AAD) aims to decode listeners' focus in complex
auditory environments from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, which is
crucial for developing neuro-steered hearing devices. Despite recent
advancements, EEG-based AAD remains hindered by the absence of synergistic
frameworks that can fully leverage complementary EEG features under
energy-efficiency constraints. We propose S$^2$M-Former, a novel spiking
symmetric mixing framework to address this limitation through two key
innovations: i) Presenting a spike-driven symmetric architecture composed of
parallel spatial and frequency branches with mirrored modular design,
leveraging biologically plausible token-channel mixers to enhance complementary
learning across branches; ii) Introducing lightweight 1D token sequences to
replace conventional 3D operations, reducing parameters by 14.7$\times$. The
brain-inspired spiking architecture further reduces power consumption,
achieving a 5.8$\times$ energy reduction compared to recent ANN methods, while
also surpassing existing SNN baselines in terms of parameter efficiency and
performance. Comprehensive experiments on three AAD benchmarks (KUL, DTU and
AV-GC-AAD) across three settings (within-trial, cross-trial and cross-subject)
demonstrate that S$^2$M-Former achieves comparable state-of-the-art (SOTA)
decoding accuracy, making it a promising low-power, high-performance solution
for AAD tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时通常忽略对齐质量与计算成本的平衡，HIA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: HIA结合轻量级提示优化器、启发式奖励模型和两阶段过滤，减少推理调用。

Result: 在HelpSteer和ComPRed数据集上，HIA在相同推理预算下优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: HIA在低推理预算下仍有效，为个性化LLM部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning LLMs with user preferences is crucial for real-world use but often
requires costly fine-tuning or expensive inference, forcing trade-offs between
alignment quality and computational cost. Existing inference-time methods
typically ignore this balance, focusing solely on the optimized policy's
performance. We propose HIA (Heuristic-Guided Inference-time Alignment), a
tuning-free, black-box-compatible approach that uses a lightweight prompt
optimizer, heuristic reward models, and two-stage filtering to reduce inference
calls while preserving alignment quality. On real-world prompt datasets,
HelpSteer and ComPRed, HIA outperforms best-of-N sampling, beam search, and
greedy search baselines in multi-objective, goal-conditioned tasks under the
same inference budget. We also find that HIA is effective under low-inference
budgets with as little as one or two response queries, offering a practical
solution for scalable, personalized LLM deployment.

Abstract: Consider a collection of competing machine learning algorithms. Given their
performance on a benchmark of datasets, we would like to identify the best
performing algorithm. Specifically, which algorithm is most likely to rank
highest on a future, unseen dataset. A natural approach is to select the
algorithm that demonstrates the best performance on the benchmark. However, in
many cases the performance differences are marginal and additional candidates
may also be considered. This problem is formulated as subset selection for
multinomial distributions. Formally, given a sample from a countable alphabet,
our goal is to identify a minimal subset of symbols that includes the most
frequent symbol in the population with high confidence. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework for the subset selection problem. We provide both
asymptotic and finite-sample schemes that significantly improve upon currently
known methods. In addition, we provide matching lower bounds, demonstrating the
favorable performance of our proposed schemes.

Abstract: We developed a ResNet-based human activity recognition (HAR) model with
minimal overhead to detect gait versus non-gait activities and everyday

transitions). The model was trained and evaluated using smartphone sensor data
from adult healthy controls (HC) and people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) with
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 0.0-6.5. Datasets
included the GaitLab study (ISRCTN15993728), an internal Roche dataset, and

proposed model not only demonstrated higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
model (96.2% vs 91.9%; internal Roche dataset) but also maintained high
performance across 9 smartphone wear locations (handbag, shopping bag,
crossbody bag, backpack, hoodie pocket, coat/jacket pocket, hand, neck, belt),
outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 2.8% - 9.0%. In conclusion, the
proposed HAR model accurately detects everyday activities and shows high
robustness to various smartphone wear locations, demonstrating its practical
applicability.

Method: PITI-DeepONet采用双输出架构，通过物理驱动或混合目标训练，学习时间导数算子并结合经典时间步进方案推进解。

Result: 在多个基准问题中，PITI-DeepONet显著降低了误差（如热方程误差减少84%），优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PITI-DeepONet为复杂时间依赖PDEs的长期可靠积分提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurately modeling and inferring solutions to time-dependent partial
differential equations (PDEs) over extended horizons remains a core challenge
in scientific machine learning. Traditional full rollout (FR) methods, which
predict entire trajectories in one pass, often fail to capture the causal
dependencies and generalize poorly outside the training time horizon.
Autoregressive (AR) approaches, evolving the system step by step, suffer from
error accumulation, limiting long-term accuracy. These shortcomings limit the
long-term accuracy and reliability of both strategies. To address these issues,
we introduce the Physics-Informed Time-Integrated Deep Operator Network
(PITI-DeepONet), a dual-output architecture trained via fully physics-informed
or hybrid physics- and data-driven objectives to ensure stable, accurate
long-term evolution well beyond the training horizon. Instead of forecasting
future states, the network learns the time-derivative operator from the current
state, integrating it using classical time-stepping schemes to advance the
solution in time. Additionally, the framework can leverage residual monitoring
during inference to estimate prediction quality and detect when the system
transitions outside the training domain. Applied to benchmark problems,
PITI-DeepONet shows improved accuracy over extended inference time horizons
when compared to traditional methods. Mean relative $\mathcal{L}_2$ errors
reduced by 84% (vs. FR) and 79% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional heat equation;
by 87% (vs. FR) and 98% (vs. AR) for the one-dimensional Burgers equation; and
by 42% (vs. FR) and 89% (vs. AR) for the two-dimensional Allen-Cahn equation.
By moving beyond classic FR and AR schemes, PITI-DeepONet paves the way for
more reliable, long-term integration of complex, time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge for deploying Large Language

Financial applications have unique requirements, often relying on

real-world financial documents. Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,
automated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new
hallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a
comprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in
state-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust

building more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.

Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉钻井数据中的复杂时空关系，导致预测效果不佳。

Method: 采用混合深度学习架构，整合LSTM、Transformer、TS-Mixer和注意力机制，建模时间依赖性和特征交互。

Result: 模型在真实数据集上表现优异，R-squared达0.9988，MAPE为1.447%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时ROP预测提供了可靠解决方案，具有显著的工程应用价值。

Abstract: The Rate of Penetration (ROP) is crucial for optimizing drilling operations;
however, accurately predicting it is hindered by the complex, dynamic, and
high-dimensional nature of drilling data. Traditional empirical, physics-based,
and basic machine learning models often fail to capture intricate temporal and
contextual relationships, resulting in suboptimal predictions and limited
real-time utility. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning
architecture integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformer
encoders, Time-Series Mixer (TS-Mixer) blocks, and attention mechanisms to
synergistically model temporal dependencies, static feature interactions,
global context, and dynamic feature importance. Evaluated on a real-world
drilling dataset, our model outperformed benchmarks (standalone LSTM, TS-Mixer,
and simpler hybrids) with an R-squared score of 0.9988 and a Mean Absolute
Percentage Error of 1.447%, as measured by standard regression metrics
(R-squared, MAE, RMSE, MAPE). Model interpretability was ensured using SHAP and
LIME, while actual vs. predicted curves and bias checks confirmed accuracy and
fairness across scenarios. This advanced hybrid approach enables reliable
real-time ROP prediction, paving the way for intelligent, cost-effective
drilling optimization systems with significant operational impact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋叶绿素浓度是生态系统健康和碳循环强度的重要指标，准确预测对赤潮预警和生态响应至关重要。

Method: 采用LSTM-RF混合模型，结合多源海洋数据（温度、盐度、溶解氧等），通过标准化处理和滑动窗口方法提升预测精度。

Result: LSTM-RF模型在测试集上的R^2为0.5386，MSE为0.005806，MAE为0.057147，显著优于单独使用LSTM或RF。

Conclusion: LSTM-RF模型为海洋生态变量的高频预测提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Marine chlorophyll concentration is an important indicator of ecosystem
health and carbon cycle strength, and its accurate prediction is crucial for
red tide warning and ecological response. In this paper, we propose a LSTM-RF
hybrid model that combines the advantages of LSTM and RF, which solves the
deficiencies of a single model in time-series modelling and nonlinear feature
portrayal. Trained with multi-source ocean data(temperature, salinity,
dissolved oxygen, etc.), the experimental results show that the LSTM-RF model
has an R^2 of 0.5386, an MSE of 0.005806, and an MAE of 0.057147 on the test
set, which is significantly better than using LSTM (R^2 = 0.0208) and RF (R^2
=0.4934) alone , respectively. The standardised treatment and sliding window
approach improved the prediction accuracy of the model and provided an
innovative solution for high-frequency prediction of marine ecological
variables.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的倾向得分加权方法DFW，通过去混淆因子构建稳定的样本权重，优于现有方法如IPW和CBPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决倾向得分加权方法因数据或模型错误导致的权重不稳定问题，提升选择偏差处理和治疗效果估计能力。

Method: 提出Deconfounding Factor Weighting (DFW)，利用去混淆因子构建稳定权重，优先选择较少混淆样本。

Result: 实验表明DFW在协变量平衡和治疗效果估计上优于IPW和CBPS。

Conclusion: DFW是一种有效的倾向得分加权方法，适用于二元和多治疗场景，显著提升估计稳定性。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from observational data is challenging due to
selection bias, which leads to imbalanced covariate distributions across
treatment groups. Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to
address this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled
trial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the
observed data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator. For example,
inverse propensity weighting (IPW) assigns weights based on the inverse of the
propensity score, which can lead to instable weights when propensity scores
have high variance-either due to data or model misspecification-ultimately
degrading the ability of handling selection bias and treatment effect
estimation. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deconfounding Factor
Weighting (DFW), a novel propensity score-based approach that leverages the
deconfounding factor-to construct stable and effective sample weights. DFW
prioritizes less confounded samples while mitigating the influence of highly
confounded ones, producing a pseudopopulation that better approximates a RCT.
Our approach ensures bounded weights, lower variance, and improved covariate
balance.While DFW is formulated for binary treatments, it naturally extends to
multi-treatment settings, as the deconfounding factor is computed based on the
estimated probability of the treatment actually received by each sample.
Through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark and synthetic datasets,
we demonstrate that DFW outperforms existing methods, including IPW and CBPS,
in both covariate balancing and treatment effect estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型在泛化性、适应性和计算效率方面表现不佳，FlowState旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FlowState采用状态空间模型编码器和函数基解码器，支持连续时间建模和动态时间尺度调整。

Result: FlowState在GIFT-ZS和Chronos-ZS基准测试中表现最优，且模型更小、数据需求更低。

Conclusion: FlowState通过创新设计和高效预训练策略，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed natural language processing, but
their success has not yet translated to time series forecasting. Existing time
series foundation models (TSFMs), often based on transformer variants, struggle
with generalization across varying context and target lengths, lack
adaptability to different sampling rates, and are computationally inefficient.
We introduce FlowState, a novel TSFM architecture that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: a state space model (SSM) based encoder
and a functional basis decoder. This design enables continuous-time modeling
and dynamic time-scale adjustment, allowing FlowState to inherently generalize
across all possible temporal resolutions, and dynamically adjust the
forecasting horizons. In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which
require training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns
at each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input
scale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved
efficiency. We further propose an efficient pretraining strategy that improves
robustness and accelerates training. Despite being the smallest model,
FlowState outperforms all other models and is state-of-the-art for the GIFT-ZS
and the Chronos-ZS benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of
its components, and we demonstrate its unique ability to adapt online to
varying input sampling rates.

Motivation: 减少人类教学努力是交互式模仿学习广泛应用的关键瓶颈。现有方法未充分利用新手计划中的信息。

Method: 提出ASkDAgger框架，包含SAG、FIER和PIER三个组件，分别调整阈值、重放演示和优先重放。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中验证了ASkDAgger的有效性，减少了注释需求并提高了适应性。

Conclusion: ASkDAgger通过优化查询和反馈机制，显著提升了交互式模仿学习的效率和适应性。

Abstract: Human teaching effort is a significant bottleneck for the broader
applicability of interactive imitation learning. To reduce the number of
required queries, existing methods employ active learning to query the human
teacher only in uncertain, risky, or novel situations. However, during these
queries, the novice's planned actions are not utilized despite containing
valuable information, such as the novice's capabilities, as well as
corresponding uncertainty levels. To this end, we allow the novice to say: "I
plan to do this, but I am uncertain." We introduce the Active Skill-level Data
Aggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the
novice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating
threshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)
Foresight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and
relabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized
Interactive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on
uncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age. Together, these components
balance query frequency with failure incidence, reduce the number of required
demonstration annotations, improve generalization, and speed up adaptation to
changing domains. We validate the effectiveness of ASkDAgger through
language-conditioned manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world
environments. Code, data, and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习的集中式架构存在单点故障、个性化不足和对数据分布变化的脆弱性，需要更灵活和鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用P2P拓扑结构，通过本地验证集计算一致性分数，选择个性化更新集合并引入正则化项。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，LIGHTYEAR在客户端性能和对抗性、异构条件下优于集中式基准和现有P2P方法。

Conclusion: LIGHTYEAR通过去中心化和个性化更新选择，显著提升了联邦学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy by keeping data local.
Traditional FL approaches rely on a centralized, star-shaped topology, where a
central server aggregates model updates from clients. However, this
architecture introduces several limitations, including a single point of
failure, limited personalization, and poor robustness to distribution shifts or
vulnerability to malfunctioning clients. Moreover, update selection in
centralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be
unreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and
offer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,
peer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework. It leverages the flexibility of the P2P
topology to enable each client to identify and aggregate a personalized set of
trustworthy and beneficial updates.This framework is the Local Inference Guided
Aggregation for Heterogeneous Training Environments to Yield Enhancement
Through Agreement and Regularization (LIGHTYEAR). Central to our method is an
agreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the
semantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to
the clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored
subset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that
further stabilizes the training. Our empirical evaluation across two datasets
shows that the proposed approach consistently outperforms both centralized
baselines and existing P2P methods in terms of client-level performance,
particularly under adversarial and heterogeneous conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PEFT方法（如LoRA）与基础模型架构紧密耦合，限制了其在异构预训练LLM中的适用性。

Method: Cross-LoRA包含两个关键组件：LoRA-Align（通过SVD和线性变换对齐子空间）和LoRA-Shift（将源LoRA权重更新投影到目标模型参数空间）。

Result: 实验显示，Cross-LoRA在多个基准测试中相对基础模型提升了5.26%，性能接近直接训练的LoRA适配器。

Conclusion: Cross-LoRA提供了一种轻量级、高效的方法，适用于异构LLM之间的参数高效微调。

Abstract: Traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA are
tightly coupled with the base model architecture, which constrains their
applicability across heterogeneous pretrained large language models (LLMs). To
address this limitation, we introduce Cross-LoRA, a data-free framework for
transferring LoRA modules between diverse base models without requiring
additional training data. Cross-LoRA consists of two key components: (a)
LoRA-Align, which performs subspace alignment between source and target base
models through rank-truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) and
Frobenius-optimal linear transformation, ensuring compatibility under dimension
mismatch; and (b) LoRA-Shift, which applies the aligned subspaces to project
source LoRA weight updates into the target model parameter space. Both
components are data-free, training-free, and enable lightweight adaptation on a
commodity GPU in 20 minutes. Experiments on ARCs, OBOA and HellaSwag show that
Cross-LoRA achieves relative gains of up to 5.26% over base models. Across
other commonsense reasoning benchmarks, Cross-LoRA maintains performance
comparable to that of directly trained LoRA adapters.

TL;DR: OCAT（Optimal Corpus Aware Training）通过微调CAT预训练模型，仅调整少量与语料库相关的参数，提升模型准确性，同时避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAT方法在训练前需预定义高质量数据组，容易出错且效率低下。OCAT旨在解决这一问题，提供更轻量且高效的训练方式。

Method: OCAT冻结大部分模型参数，仅微调少量与语料库相关的参数，提升模型性能。

Result: 在WMT23英中和英德翻译任务中，OCAT分别带来3.6和1.8 chrF的提升，优于传统训练方法。

Conclusion: OCAT是一种轻量、高效且对超参数不敏感的微调技术，性能与现有先进方法相当或更优。

Abstract: Corpus Aware Training (CAT) leverages valuable corpus metadata during
training by injecting corpus information into each training example, and has
been found effective in the literature, commonly known as the "tagging"
approach. Models trained with CAT inherently learn the quality, domain and
nuance between corpora directly from data, and can easily switch to different
inference behavior. To achieve the best evaluation, CAT models pre-define a
group of high quality data before training starts which can be error-prone and
inefficient. In this work, we propose Optimal Corpus Aware Training (OCAT),
which fine-tunes a CAT pre-trained model by freezing most of the model
parameters and only tuning small set of corpus-related parameters. We show that
OCAT is lightweight, resilient to overfitting, and effective in boosting model
accuracy. We use WMT23 English to Chinese and English to German translation
tasks as our test ground and show +3.6 and +1.8 chrF improvement, respectively,
over vanilla training. Furthermore, our approach is on-par or slightly better
than other state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques while being less sensitive
to hyperparameter settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合基专家（MoBE）方法，用于压缩大型语言模型中的MoE架构，显著减少参数数量且仅带来微小的精度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MoE架构在性能和计算效率上表现优异，但其部署时的巨大内存需求成为挑战。现有压缩方法在精度上损失较大，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过将每个专家的权重矩阵分解为A和B，其中B进一步表示为共享基矩阵的线性组合，从而减少参数数量。

Result: 实验表明，MoBE能在减少24%-30%参数的同时，仅带来1%-2%的精度下降（相对下降约2%）。

Conclusion: MoBE方法在压缩MoE模型时表现出色，显著优于现有方法，为实际部署提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has become a predominant paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs). Despite offering strong performance
and computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Kimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory
requirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to
address this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy
drops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper
introduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model
compression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate
matrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where
matrix A is unique to each expert. The relatively larger matrix B is further
re-parameterized as a linear combination of basis matrices {Bi} shared across
all experts within a given MoE layer. The factorization is learned by
minimizing the reconstruction error relative to the original weight matrices.
Experiments demonstrate that MoBE achieves notably lower accuracy drops
compared to prior works. For instance, MoBE can reduce the parameter counts of
Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507, DeepSeek-V3-0324 (671B) and Kimi-K2-Instruct (1T) by
24%-30% with only 1%-2% accuracy drop (about 2% drops when measured
relatively).

TL;DR: Echo是一个RL系统，通过分离推理和训练阶段，解决了现代RL后训练中GPU集群的串行切换问题，同时保持统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代RL后训练中，推理和训练工作负载在同一GPU集群上串行切换，违反了分布式训练系统的SPMD假设。

Method: Echo引入两种轻量级同步协议：顺序拉取模式和异步推送-拉取模式，分别用于最小化偏差和最大化硬件利用率。

Result: 在分布式集群上训练三种RL工作负载，Echo在收敛速度和最终奖励上与完全共置的基线相当，同时将轨迹生成卸载到边缘硬件。

Conclusion: Echo证明了大规模RL可以通过分散、异构资源实现数据中心级性能。

Abstract: Modern RL-based post-training for large language models (LLMs) co-locate
trajectory sampling and policy optimisation on the same GPU cluster, forcing
the system to switch between inference and training workloads. This serial
context switching violates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) assumption
underlying today's distributed training systems. We present Echo, the RL system
that cleanly decouples these two phases across heterogeneous "inference" and
"training" swarms while preserving statistical efficiency. Echo introduces two
lightweight synchronization protocols: a sequential pull mode that refreshes
sampler weights on every API call for minimal bias, and an asynchronous
push-pull mode that streams version-tagged rollouts through a replay buffer to
maximise hardware utilisation. Training three representative RL workloads with
Qwen3-4B, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen3-32B on a geographically distributed cluster,
Echo matches a fully co-located Verl baseline in convergence speed and final
reward while off-loading trajectory generation to commodity edge hardware.
These promising results demonstrate that large-scale RL for LLMs could achieve
datacentre-grade performance using decentralised, heterogeneous resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS仅基于期望回报做决策，无法应对高风险或极端情况的尾部风险，可能导致严重后果。

Method: 1. CVaR-MCTS：引入条件风险价值（CVaR）控制尾部风险；2. W-MCTS：通过Wasserstein模糊集解决尾部风险估计偏差。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在尾部风险控制和性能上优于现有基线，同时提供理论安全保证。

Conclusion: CVaR-MCTS和W-MCTS有效解决了MCTS的尾部风险问题，适用于高风险场景。

Abstract: Making decisions with respect to just the expected returns in Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) cannot account for the potential range of high-risk, adverse
outcomes associated with a decision. To this end, safety-aware MCTS often
consider some constrained variants -- by introducing some form of mean risk
measures or hard cost thresholds. These approaches fail to provide rigorous
tail-safety guarantees with respect to extreme or high-risk outcomes (denoted
as tail-risk), potentially resulting in serious consequence in high-stake
scenarios. This paper addresses the problem by developing two novel solutions.
We first propose CVaR-MCTS, which embeds a coherent tail risk measure,
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), into MCTS. Our CVaR-MCTS with parameter
$\alpha$ achieves explicit tail-risk control over the expected loss in the
"worst $(1-\alpha)\%$ scenarios." Second, we further address the estimation
bias of tail-risk due to limited samples. We propose Wasserstein-MCTS (or
W-MCTS) by introducing a first-order Wasserstein ambiguity set
$\mathcal{P}_{\varepsilon_{s}}(s,a)$ with radius $\varepsilon_{s}$ to
characterize the uncertainty in tail-risk estimates. We prove PAC tail-safety
guarantees for both CVaR-MCTS and W-MCTS and establish their regret.
Evaluations on diverse simulated environments demonstrate that our proposed
methods outperform existing baselines, effectively achieving robust tail-risk
guarantees with improved rewards and stability.

Result: 实验表明，EnergyPatchTST预测误差降低7-12%，并提供可靠的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: EnergyPatchTST为能源领域时间序列预测提供了重要参考，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable energy time series prediction is of great significance
for power generation planning and allocation. At present, deep learning time
series prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale
time dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the
existing methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension
of the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.
The main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature
extraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)
probability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo
elimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as
temperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples
to enhance the performance of limited energy data sets. A series of experiments
on common energy data sets show that EnergyPatchTST is superior to other
commonly used methods, the prediction error is reduced by 7-12%, and reliable
uncertainty estimation is provided, which provides an important reference for
time series prediction in the energy field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调无法捕捉隐式反馈信号（如停留时间、情感极性），因此需要一种更有效的方法来优化基于大语言模型（LLM）的CRS。

Method: 使用RLHF方法，通过奖励模型$R_{\phi}$学习弱标记的参与信息，并采用近端策略优化（PPO）优化LLM $M_{\theta}$。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集（如REDIAL、OpenDialKG）上的评估表明，RLHF微调模型在推荐准确性、连贯性和用户满意度方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 隐式信号对齐能有效实现CRS的可扩展和用户自适应设计。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRS) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) need to constantly be aligned to the user preferences to provide
satisfying and context-relevant item recommendations. The traditional
supervised fine-tuning cannot capture the implicit feedback signal, e.g., dwell
time, sentiment polarity, or engagement patterns. In this paper, we share a
fine-tuning solution using human feedback reinforcement learning (RLHF) to
maximize implied user feedback (IUF) in a multi-turn recommendation context. We
specify a reward model $R_{\phi}$ learnt on weakly-labelled engagement
information and maximize user-centric utility by optimizing the foundational
LLM M_{\theta} through a proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach. The
architecture models conversational state transitions $s_t \to a_t \to s_{t
+1}$, where the action $a_t$ is associated with LLM-generated item suggestions
only on condition of conversation history in the past. The evaluation across
synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g.REDIAL, OpenDialKG) demonstrates that
our RLHF-fine-tuned models can perform better in terms of top-$k$
recommendation accuracy, coherence, and user satisfaction compared to

of the input data and the problems they solve remains obscure. In this work, we
introduce a suite of five data-agnostic probes-pruning, binarization, noise
injection, sign flipping, and bipartite network randomization-to quantify how
task difficulty influences the topology and robustness of representations in
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). MLPs are represented as signed, weighted
bipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard
classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that
binarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas
easy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges
in binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.
Moreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a
stochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude
weights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight
magnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high
accuracy. These phenomena define a model- and modality-agnostic measure of task
complexity: the performance gap between full-precision and binarized or
shuffled neural network performance. Our findings highlight the crucial role of
signed bipartite topology in learned representations and suggest practical
strategies for model compression and interpretability that align with task
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型的快速增长带来了计算瓶颈，批量大小和学习率的调度对训练效率和泛化能力至关重要。

Method: 基于随机一阶预言机（SFO）复杂度理论分析，推导了批量大小和学习率的最优增长计划。

Result: 通过实验验证了提出的调度方法能有效降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 研究为大规模批量训练提供了理论指导和实用建议。

Abstract: The unprecedented growth of deep learning models has enabled remarkable
advances but introduced substantial computational bottlenecks. A key factor
contributing to training efficiency is batch-size and learning-rate scheduling
in stochastic gradient methods. However, naive scheduling of these
hyperparameters can degrade optimization efficiency and compromise
generalization. Motivated by recent theoretical insights, we investigated how
the batch size and learning rate should be increased during training to balance
efficiency and convergence. We analyzed this problem on the basis of stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the expected number of gradient
evaluations needed to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the
empirical loss. We theoretically derived optimal growth schedules for the batch
size and learning rate that reduce SFO complexity and validated them through
extensive experiments. Our results offer both theoretical insights and
practical guidelines for scalable and efficient large-batch training in deep
learning.

Result: 实验表明，基于该策略的自适应联合调度器比现有调度器具有更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 临界批大小和自适应调度策略能有效提升SGD的收敛效率。

Abstract: The convergence behavior of mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is
highly sensitive to the batch size and learning rate settings. Recent
theoretical studies have identified the existence of a critical batch size that
minimizes stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, defined as the
expected number of gradient evaluations required to reach a stationary point of
the empirical loss function in a deep neural network. An adaptive scheduling
strategy is introduced to accelerate SGD that leverages theoretical findings on
the critical batch size. The batch size and learning rate are adjusted on the
basis of the observed decay in the full gradient norm during training.
Experiments using an adaptive joint scheduler based on this strategy
demonstrated improved convergence speed compared with that of existing
schedulers.

Abstract: Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary
insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However,
effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction
modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We
introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed
to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction
tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents
("specialist agents") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images
and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries,
together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM ("aggregator agent")
to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM
("predictor agent") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three
prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations
and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks.

Motivation: 随着PCs的表达能力增强，过拟合问题在数据有限时变得显著，论文从对数似然景观角度分析了这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种Hessian迹的正则化方法，通过最小化Hessian迹来引导PCs收敛到更平坦的极小值。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效提升PCs的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Hessian迹正则化是一种简单且高效的方法，适用于PCs的训练。

Abstract: Probabilistic Circuits (PCs) are a class of generative models that allow
exact and tractable inference for a wide range of queries. While recent
developments have enabled the learning of deep and expressive PCs, this
increased capacity can often lead to overfitting, especially when data is
limited. We analyze PC overfitting from a log-likelihood-landscape perspective
and show that it is often caused by convergence to sharp optima that generalize
poorly. Inspired by sharpness aware minimization in neural networks, we propose
a Hessian-based regularizer for training PCs. As a key contribution, we show
that the trace of the Hessian of the log-likelihood-a sharpness proxy that is
typically intractable in deep neural networks-can be computed efficiently for
PCs. Minimizing this Hessian trace induces a gradient-norm-based regularizer
that yields simple closed-form parameter updates for EM, and integrates
seamlessly with gradient based learning methods. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently guides PCs toward
flatter minima, improves generalization performance.

Result: USP在最终准确率上比现有方法提升高达5.94%。

Conclusion: USP框架有效解决了半监督持续学习中的关键挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) seeks to leverage both labeled and
unlabeled data in a sequential learning setup, aiming to reduce annotation
costs while managing continual data arrival. SSCL introduces complex
challenges, including ensuring effective unlabeled learning (UL), while
balancing memory stability (MS) and learning plasticity (LP). Previous SSCL
efforts have typically focused on isolated aspects of the three, while this
work presents USP, a divide-and-conquer framework designed to synergistically
enhance these three aspects: (1) Feature Space Reservation (FSR) strategy for
LP, which constructs reserved feature locations for future classes by shaping
old classes into an equiangular tight frame; (2) Divide-and-Conquer
Pseudo-labeling (DCP) approach for UL, which assigns reliable pseudo-labels
across both high- and low-confidence unlabeled data; and (3)
Class-mean-anchored Unlabeled Distillation (CUD) for MS, which reuses DCP's
outputs to anchor unlabeled data to stable class means for distillation to
prevent forgetting. Comprehensive evaluations show USP outperforms prior SSCL
methods, with gains up to 5.94% in the last accuracy, validating its
effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUyued/USP4SSCL.

Conclusion: 该综述填补了无监督VLM适应领域的空白，为未来研究提供了框架和方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization
capabilities across a wide range of tasks. However, their performance often
remains suboptimal when directly applied to specific downstream scenarios
without task-specific adaptation. To enhance their utility while preserving
data efficiency, recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised
adaptation methods that do not rely on labeled data. Despite the growing
interest in this area, there remains a lack of a unified, task-oriented survey
dedicated to unsupervised VLM adaptation. To bridge this gap, we present a
comprehensive and structured overview of the field. We propose a taxonomy based
on the availability and nature of unlabeled visual data, categorizing existing
approaches into four key paradigms: Data-Free Transfer (no data), Unsupervised
Domain Transfer (abundant data), Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (batch data),
and Online Test-Time Adaptation (streaming data). Within this framework, we
analyze core methodologies and adaptation strategies associated with each
paradigm, aiming to establish a systematic understanding of the field.
Additionally, we review representative benchmarks across diverse applications
and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future research. An

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for
medical question answering and programming, but their potential for generating
interpretable computable phenotypes (CPs) is under-explored. In this work, we
investigate whether LLMs can generate accurate and concise CPs for six clinical
phenotypes of varying complexity, which could be leveraged to enable scalable
clinical decision support to improve care for patients with hypertension. In
addition to evaluating zero-short performance, we propose and test a
synthesize, execute, debug, instruct strategy that uses LLMs to generate and
iteratively refine CPs using data-driven feedback. Our results show that LLMs,
coupled with iterative learning, can generate interpretable and reasonably
accurate programs that approach the performance of state-of-the-art ML methods
while requiring significantly fewer training examples.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在奖励分布已知时表现与潜在老虎机相当，在奖励尺度不同时表现更优。

Conclusion: 放松潜在老虎机的假设，仅需偏好排序模型，能够提升算法在实际问题中的适用性和性能。

Abstract: Bandit algorithms are guaranteed to solve diverse sequential decision-making
problems, provided that a sufficient exploration budget is available. However,
learning from scratch is often too costly for personalization tasks where a
single individual faces only a small number of decision points. Latent bandits
offer substantially reduced exploration times for such problems, given that the
joint distribution of a latent state and the rewards of actions is known and
accurate. In practice, finding such a model is non-trivial, and there may not
exist a small number of latent states that explain the responses of all
individuals. For example, patients with similar latent conditions may have the
same preference in treatments but rate their symptoms on different scales. With
this in mind, we propose relaxing the assumptions of latent bandits to require
only a model of the \emph{preference ordering} of actions in each latent state.
This allows problem instances with the same latent state to vary in their
reward distributions, as long as their preference orderings are equal. We give
a posterior-sampling algorithm for this problem and demonstrate that its
empirical performance is competitive with latent bandits that have full
knowledge of the reward distribution when this is well-specified, and
outperforms them when reward scales differ between instances with the same
latent state.

Conclusion: 数据为中心的调整对提升多模态大语言模型的强化学习效率至关重要。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective post-training
paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
model (MLLM). However, current RL pipelines often suffer from training
inefficiencies caused by two underexplored issues: Advantage Collapsing, where
most advantages in a batch concentrate near zero, and Rollout Silencing, where
the proportion of rollouts contributing non-zero gradients diminishes over
time. These issues lead to suboptimal gradient updates and hinder long-term
learning efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Shuffle-R1, a simple
yet principled framework that improves RL fine-tuning efficiency by dynamically
restructuring trajectory sampling and batch composition. It introduces (1)
Pairwise Trajectory Sampling, which selects high-contrast trajectories with
large advantages to improve gradient signal quality, and (2) Advantage-based
Trajectory Shuffle, which increases exposure of valuable rollouts through
informed batch reshuffling. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks
show that our framework consistently outperforms strong RL baselines with
minimal overhead. These results highlight the importance of data-centric
adaptations for more efficient RL training in MLLM.

Conclusion: TrajEvo为快速、可解释且泛化性强的轨迹预测启发式设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in modeling human behavior,
especially in safety-critical domains such as social robotics and autonomous
vehicle navigation. Traditional heuristics based on handcrafted rules often
lack accuracy and generalizability. Although deep learning approaches offer
improved performance, they typically suffer from high computational cost,
limited explainability, and, importantly, poor generalization to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this paper, we introduce TrajEvo, a
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design
trajectory prediction heuristics. TrajEvo employs an evolutionary algorithm to
generate and refine prediction heuristics from past trajectory data. We propose
two key innovations: Cross-Generation Elite Sampling to encourage population
diversity, and a Statistics Feedback Loop that enables the LLM to analyze and
improve alternative predictions. Our evaluations demonstrate that TrajEvo
outperforms existing heuristic methods across multiple real-world datasets, and
notably surpasses both heuristic and deep learning methods in generalizing to
an unseen OOD real-world dataset. TrajEvo marks a promising step toward the
automated design of fast, explainable, and generalizable trajectory prediction
heuristics. We release our source code to facilitate future research at

Result: 实验表明，NT-ML能有效抵御6种后门攻击，性能优于5种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: NT-ML是一种高效的后门攻击防御方法，适用于少量干净样本的场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, where a designed trigger is injected into the dataset,
causing erroneous predictions when activated. In this paper, we propose a novel
defense mechanism, Non-target label Training and Mutual Learning (NT-ML), which
can successfully restore the poisoned model under advanced backdoor attacks. NT
aims to reduce the harm of poisoned data by retraining the model with the
outputs of the standard training. At this stage, a teacher model with high
accuracy on clean data and a student model with higher confidence in correct
prediction on poisoned data are obtained. Then, the teacher and student can
learn the strengths from each other through ML to obtain a purified student
model. Extensive experiments show that NT-ML can effectively defend against 6
backdoor attacks with a small number of clean samples, and outperforms 5
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

Abstract: The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning, with its
ideal value depending on the problem and potentially changing during training.
In this paper, we investigate the practical utility of adaptive learning rate
mechanisms that adjust step sizes dynamically in response to the loss
landscape. We revisit a cumulative path-based adaptation scheme proposed in
2017, which adjusts the learning rate based on the discrepancy between the
observed path length, computed as a time-discounted sum of normalized gradient
steps, and the expected length of a random walk. While the original approach
offers a compelling intuition, we show that its adaptation mechanism for Adam
is conceptually inconsistent due to the optimizer's internal preconditioning.
We propose a corrected variant that better reflects Adam's update dynamics. To
assess the practical value of online learning rate adaptation, we benchmark SGD
and Adam, with and without cumulative adaptation, and compare them to a recent
alternative method. Our results aim to clarify when and why such adaptive
strategies offer practical benefits.

Abstract: Molecular generation conditioned on textual descriptions is a fundamental
task in computational chemistry and drug discovery. Existing methods often
struggle to simultaneously ensure high-quality, diverse generation and fast
inference. In this work, we propose a novel causality-aware framework that
addresses these challenges through two key innovations. First, we introduce a
Causality-Aware Transformer (CAT) that jointly encodes molecular graph tokens
and text instructions while enforcing causal dependencies during generation.
Second, we develop a Variational Mean Flow (VMF) framework that generalizes
existing flow-based methods by modeling the latent space as a mixture of
Gaussians, enhancing expressiveness beyond unimodal priors. VMF enables
efficient one-step inference while maintaining strong generation quality and
diversity. Extensive experiments on four standard molecular benchmarks
demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
higher novelty (up to 74.5\%), diversity (up to 70.3\%), and 100\% validity
across all datasets. Moreover, VMF requires only one number of function
evaluation (NFE) during conditional generation and up to five NFEs for
unconditional generation, offering substantial computational efficiency over
diffusion-based methods.

Abstract: Forecasting stock and cryptocurrency prices is challenging due to high
volatility and non-stationarity, influenced by factors like economic changes

can effectively model short-term stock market movements, capturing nonlinear
patterns in dynamic data. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the
first to explore ESNs for cryptocurrency forecasting, especially during extreme

Conclusion: 通过负二项分布建模神经元放电，NegBio-VAE提供了更准确的神经表示，为相关研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Biological neurons communicate through spike trains, discrete, irregular
bursts of activity that exhibit variability far beyond the modeling capacity of
conventional variational autoencoders (VAEs). Recent work, such as the
Poisson-VAE, makes a biologically inspired move by modeling spike counts using
the Poisson distribution. However, they impose a rigid constraint: equal mean
and variance, which fails to reflect the true stochastic nature of neural
activity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and introduce NegBio-VAE,
a principled extension of the VAE framework that models spike counts using the
negative binomial distribution. This shift grants explicit control over
dispersion, unlocking a broader and more accurate family of neural
representations. We further develop two ELBO optimization schemes and two
differentiable reparameterization strategies tailored to the negative binomial
setting. By introducing one additional dispersion parameter, NegBio-VAE
generalizes the Poisson latent model to a negative binomial formulation.
Empirical results demonstrate this minor yet impactful change leads to
significant gains in reconstruction fidelity, highlighting the importance of
explicitly modeling overdispersion in spike-like activations.

(FMOL) attempts to import multi-objective optimisation (MOO) into FL. However,
it merely delivers task-wise Pareto-stationary points, leaving client fairness
to chance. In this paper, we introduce Conically-Regularised FMOL (CR-FMOL),
the first federated MOO framework that enforces client-wise Pareto optimality
through a novel preference-cone constraint. After local federated
multi-gradient descent averaging (FMGDA) / federated stochastic multi-gradient
descent averaging (FSMGDA) steps, each client transmits its aggregated
task-loss vector as an implicit preference; the server then solves a
cone-constrained Pareto-MTL sub-problem centred at the uniform vector,
producing a descent direction that is Pareto-stationary for every client within
its cone. Experiments on non-IID benchmarks show that CR-FMOL enhances client
fairness, and although the early-stage performance is slightly inferior to
FedAvg, it is expected to achieve comparable accuracy given sufficient training
rounds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果分析的优化方法GCPO，改进了GRPO方法，通过引入结构因果模型和因果投影提升预测质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GRPO忽略了候选响应之间的语义交互，如互补性和矛盾性，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出结构因果模型（SCM）揭示隐藏依赖关系，并设计GCPO方法，结合因果奖励调整和KL正则化。

Result: 实验表明GCPO在多个推理基准上优于GRPO等现有方法。

Conclusion: GCPO通过因果分析显著提升了模型性能，为专业领域任务提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have broadened their
applicability across diverse tasks, yet specialized domains still require
targeted post training. Among existing methods, Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) stands out for its efficiency, leveraging groupwise
relative rewards while avoiding costly value function learning. However, GRPO
treats candidate responses as independent, overlooking semantic interactions
such as complementarity and contradiction. To address this challenge, we first
introduce a Structural Causal Model (SCM) that reveals hidden dependencies
among candidate responses induced by conditioning on a final integrated output
forming a collider structure. Then, our causal analysis leads to two insights:
(1) projecting responses onto a causally informed subspace improves prediction
quality, and (2) this projection yields a better baseline than query only
conditioning. Building on these insights, we propose Group Causal Policy
Optimization (GCPO), which integrates causal structure into optimization
through two key components: a causally informed reward adjustment and a novel
KL regularization term that aligns the policy with a causally projected
reference distribution. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that
GCPO consistently surpasses existing methods, including GRPO across multiple
reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: MLES结合多模态大语言模型与进化搜索，生成可解释的高性能控制策略，性能媲美PPO，同时提供透明逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习在控制任务中性能高但缺乏可解释性的问题，以增强信任和实际部署。

Method: MLES利用多模态大语言模型生成策略，结合进化机制优化，并通过视觉反馈分析失败模式。

Result: 在两项控制任务中，MLES性能与PPO相当，同时提供透明逻辑和可追溯设计。

Conclusion: MLES是一种可扩展、可解释的策略发现方法，有望成为下一代控制策略设计的领先方法。

Abstract: Interpretability and high performance are essential goals in designing
control policies, particularly for safety-critical tasks. Deep reinforcement
learning has greatly enhanced performance, yet its inherent lack of
interpretability often undermines trust and hinders real-world deployment. This
work addresses these dual challenges by introducing a novel approach for
programmatic policy discovery, called Multimodal Large Language Model-assisted
Evolutionary Search (MLES). MLES utilizes multimodal large language models as
policy generators, combining them with evolutionary mechanisms for automatic
policy optimization. It integrates visual feedback-driven behavior analysis
within the policy generation process to identify failure patterns and
facilitate targeted improvements, enhancing the efficiency of policy discovery
and producing adaptable, human-aligned policies. Experimental results show that
MLES achieves policy discovery capabilities and efficiency comparable to
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) across two control tasks, while offering
transparent control logic and traceable design processes. This paradigm
overcomes the limitations of predefined domain-specific languages, facilitates
knowledge transfer and reuse, and is scalable across various control tasks.
MLES shows promise as a leading approach for the next generation of
interpretable control policy discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时间-事件预测对决策至关重要，但竞争风险常被误视为截尾，导致生存估计偏差和公平性问题。

Method: 开发了一个框架来量化将竞争风险误分类为截尾的误差，并分析其对预测性能和算法公平性的影响。

Result: 实证分析表明，忽视竞争风险会不成比例地影响高风险个体，加剧不公平性。

Conclusion: 生存模型需考虑竞争风险以提高准确性、减少评估偏差，并改善决策公平性。

Abstract: Accurate time-to-event prediction is integral to decision-making, informing
medical guidelines, hiring decisions, and resource allocation. Survival
analysis, the quantitative framework used to model time-to-event data, accounts
for patients who do not experience the event of interest during the study
period, known as censored patients. However, many patients experience events
that prevent the observation of the outcome of interest. These competing risks
are often treated as censoring, a practice frequently overlooked due to a
limited understanding of its consequences. Our work theoretically demonstrates
why treating competing risks as censoring introduces substantial bias in
survival estimates, leading to systematic overestimation of risk and,
critically, amplifying disparities. First, we formalize the problem of
misclassifying competing risks as censoring and quantify the resulting error in
survival estimates. Specifically, we develop a framework to estimate this error
and demonstrate the associated implications for predictive performance and
algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, we examine how differing risk profiles
across demographic groups lead to group-specific errors, potentially
exacerbating existing disparities. Our findings, supported by an empirical
analysis of cardiovascular management, demonstrate that ignoring competing
risks disproportionately impacts the individuals most at risk of these events,
potentially accentuating inequity. By quantifying the error and highlighting
the fairness implications of the common practice of considering competing risks
as censoring, our work provides a critical insight into the development of
survival models: practitioners must account for competing risks to improve
accuracy, reduce disparities in risk assessment, and better inform downstream
decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床存在（clinical presence）影响观察结果，但现有预测模型通常忽略这一点，导致性能和可迁移性受限。

Method: 提出多任务循环神经网络，联合建模观察时间、缺失过程和生存结局。

Result: 在MIMIC-III数据集上的死亡率预测任务中，该方法比现有模型表现更好且更具可迁移性。

Conclusion: 利用临床存在信息可提升预测模型性能和可迁移性。

Abstract: Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients
and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred
to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic
health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice
to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the
transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a
multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation
time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel
to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of
clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings
(e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify
why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in
clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in
the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and
transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not
incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of
leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more
transportable clinical prediction models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种无参数的多视图聚类算法（AMVFCM-U和AAMVFCM-U），通过熵正则化和信噪比加权实现自适应跨视图共识，显著提升了计算效率和降维能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类面临高维特征和无关信息管理的挑战，传统方法依赖人工调参且缺乏跨视图整合机制。

Method: 采用熵正则化替代模糊化参数，结合信噪比加权和双级熵项，AAMVFCM-U还通过自适应阈值实现分层降维。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于15种先进方法，AAMVFCM-U计算效率提升97%，降维至原尺寸的0.45%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架无需人工调参，自动识别关键视图组合，优化模式发现。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering faces critical challenges in automatically discovering
patterns across heterogeneous data while managing high-dimensional features and
eliminating irrelevant information. Traditional approaches suffer from manual
parameter tuning and lack principled cross-view integration mechanisms. This
work introduces two complementary algorithms: AMVFCM-U and AAMVFCM-U, providing
a unified parameter-free framework. Our approach replaces fuzzification
parameters with entropy regularization terms that enforce adaptive cross-view
consensus. The core innovation employs signal-to-noise ratio based
regularization ($\delta_j^h = \frac{\bar{x}_j^h}{(\sigma_j^h)^2}$) for
principled feature weighting with convergence guarantees, coupled with
dual-level entropy terms that automatically balance view and feature
contributions. AAMVFCM-U extends this with hierarchical dimensionality
reduction operating at feature and view levels through adaptive thresholding
($\theta^{h^{(t)}} = \frac{d_h^{(t)}}{n}$). Evaluation across five diverse
benchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods. AAMVFCM-U
achieves up to 97% computational efficiency gains, reduces dimensionality to
0.45% of original size, and automatically identifies critical view combinations
for optimal pattern discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: X-VFL是一种新型垂直联邦学习框架，解决了数据样本不对齐和缺失特征的问题，并支持本地独立推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统垂直联邦学习需要数据样本完全对齐且不支持本地独立推断，X-VFL旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 设计了Cross Completion（XCom）和Decision Subspace Alignment（DS-Align）模块，分别用于特征补全和决策子空间对齐。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和MIMIC-III数据集上分别实现了15%和43%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: X-VFL在特征缺失和本地推断场景中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables collaborative learning by
integrating disjoint feature subsets from multiple clients/parties. However,
VFL typically faces two key challenges: i) the requirement for perfectly
aligned data samples across all clients (missing features are not allowed); ii)
the requirement for joint collaborative inference/prediction involving all
clients (it does not support locally independent inference on a single client).
To address these challenges, we propose X-VFL, a new VFL framework designed to
deal with the non-aligned data samples with (partially) missing features and to
support locally independent inference of new data samples for each client. In
particular, we design two novel modules in X-VFL: Cross Completion (XCom) and
Decision Subspace Alignment (DS-Align). XCom can complete/reconstruct missing
features for non-aligned data samples by leveraging information from other
clients. DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features
across all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally
independent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems
for different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$
convergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type
algorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly
outperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on
the image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III
dataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of
X-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and
locally independent inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练（QAT）研究仅关注最小化全精度模型的量化误差，而未能突破其性能上限。本文旨在打破这一限制。

Method: 利用复数域的表征优势，将权重映射到四次单位根 {±1, ±i}，形成对称且信息最优的 2 位表示，实现无乘法推理。

Result: Fairy±i 在 PPL 和下游任务中超越了现有 2 位量化方法的性能上限，同时保持存储和计算效率。

Conclusion: 该研究为极低位约束下构建高精度实用 LLMs 开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) integrates quantization into the training
loop, enabling LLMs to learn robust low-bit representations, and is widely
recognized as one of the most promising research directions. All current QAT
research focuses on minimizing quantization error on full-precision models,
where the full-precision accuracy acts as an upper bound (accuracy ceiling). No
existing method has even attempted to surpass this ceiling. To break this
ceiling, we propose a new paradigm: raising the ceiling (full-precision model),
and then still quantizing it efficiently into 2 bits. We propose Fairy$\pm i$,
the first 2-bit quantization framework for complex-valued LLMs. Specifically,
our method leverages the representational advantages of the complex domain to
boost full-precision accuracy. We map weights to the fourth roots of unity
$\{\pm1, \pm i\}$, forming a perfectly symmetric and information-theoretically
optimal 2-bit representation. Importantly, each quantized weight has either a
zero real or imaginary part, enabling multiplication-free inference using only
additions and element swaps. Experimental results show that Fairy$\pm i$
outperforms the ceiling of existing 2-bit quantization approaches in terms of
both PPL and downstream tasks, while maintaining strict storage and compute
efficiency. This work opens a new direction for building highly accurate and
practical LLMs under extremely low-bit constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的知识图谱嵌入方法在缺乏负样本时通常需要人工生成负样本，但大多数库仅支持基本策略，缺乏高级解决方案。

Method: 通过扩展PyKEEN框架，集成了一套静态和动态负采样策略，保持与现有工作流的兼容性。

Result: 实证研究表明，扩展后的框架显著提升了不同嵌入方法在链接预测任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该扩展不仅增强了PyKEEN的功能，还为嵌入方法的开发和定制提供了更灵活的工具。

Abstract: Embedding methods have become popular due to their scalability on link
prediction and/or triple classification tasks on Knowledge Graphs. Embedding
models are trained relying on both positive and negative samples of triples.
However, in the absence of negative assertions, these must be usually
artificially generated using various negative sampling strategies, ranging from
random corruption to more sophisticated techniques which have an impact on the
overall performance. Most of the popular libraries for knowledge graph
embedding, support only basic such strategies and lack advanced solutions. To
address this gap, we deliver an extension for the popular KGE framework PyKEEN
that integrates a suite of several advanced negative samplers (including both
static and dynamic corruption strategies), within a consistent modular
architecture, to generate meaningful negative samples, while remaining
compatible with existing PyKEEN -based workflows and pipelines. The developed
extension not only enhancesPyKEEN itself but also allows for easier and
comprehensive development of embedding methods and/or for their customization.
As a proof of concept, we present a comprehensive empirical study of the
developed extensions and their impact on the performance (link prediction
tasks) of different embedding methods, which also provides useful insights for
the design of more effective strategies

Result: 证明单毒样本可实现零后门误差，且对正常任务影响有限。

Conclusion: 单毒样本攻击可行，为后门攻击防御提供了新视角。

Abstract: Backdoor injection attacks are a threat to machine learning models that are
trained on large data collected from untrusted sources; these attacks enable
attackers to inject malicious behavior into the model that can be triggered by
specially crafted inputs. Prior work has established bounds on the success of
backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open
question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor
attack. Typical attacks either use few samples, but need much information about
the data points or need to poison many data points.
  In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one
poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero
backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task
performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression
and linear classification. For adversaries that utilize a direction that is
unused by the benign data distribution for the poison sample, we show that the
resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was
excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning
to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is
still limited. We also validate our theoretical results experimentally with
realistic benchmark data sets.

Abstract: We present a simple yet theoretically motivated improvement to Supervised

model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing
gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function
with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change
significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks
and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally,
our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an
effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and
practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决子集和问题中是否存在更高效的时空复杂度算法，特别是针对多项式空间和接近线性时间的需求。

Method: 基于Jin等人的框架，采用多点评估方法优化算法瓶颈步骤，提出确定性和随机性算法。

Result: 确定性算法在$\tilde{O}(nt)$时间和$\tilde{O}(n \log^2 t)$空间运行；随机性算法在$\tilde{O}(n+t)$时间和$\tilde{O}(n^2 + n \log^2 t)$空间运行。

Conclusion: 成功回答了Jin等人提出的问题，证明了存在高效的时空复杂度算法。

Abstract: Given a multiset $A = \{a_1, \dots, a_n\}$ of positive integers and a target
integer $t$, the Subset Sum problem asks if there is a subset of $A$ that sums
to $t$. Bellman's [1957] classical dynamic programming algorithm runs in
$O(nt)$ time and $O(t)$ space. Since then, there have been multiple
improvements in both time and space complexity.
  Notably, Bringmann [SODA 2017] uses a two-step color-coding technique to
obtain a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and
$\tilde{O}(t)$ space. On the other hand, there are polynomial space algorithms
-- for example, Jin, Vyas and Williams [SODA 2021] build upon the algorithm
given by Bringmann, using a clever algebraic trick first seen in Kane's
Logspace algorithm, to obtain an $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(\log(nt))$
space algorithm. A natural question, asked by Jin et al. is if there is an
$\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time algorithm running in poly$(n, \log t)$ space. Another
natural question is whether it is possible to construct a deterministic
polynomial space algorithm with time complexity comparable to that of
Bellman's.
  In this paper, we answer both questions affirmatively. We build on the
framework given by Jin et al., using a multipoint evaluation-based approach to
speed up a bottleneck step in their algorithm. We construct a deterministic
algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(nt)$ time and $\tilde{O}(n \log^2 t)$ space
and a randomized algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n+t)$ time and
$\tilde{O}(n^2 + n \log^2 t)$ space.

Motivation: 瞬态编辑序列（如独立编辑流或假设编辑测试）需要高效的模式匹配支持，但现有方法难以满足需求。

Method: 设计了一种数据结构，预处理文本后支持瞬态子串插入、删除或替换，并能在编辑后快速报告模式匹配结果。

Result: 预处理时间为线性，模式匹配时间为对数或线性，具体取决于操作类型。

Conclusion: 该方法为瞬态编辑序列提供了高效的文本索引和模式匹配解决方案。

Abstract: A sequence $e_0,e_1,\ldots$ of edit operations in a string $T$ is called
ephemeral if operation $e_i$ constructing string $T^i$, for all $i=2k$ with
$k\in\mathbb{N}$, is reverted by operation $e_{i+1}$ that reconstructs $T$.
Such a sequence arises when processing a stream of independent edits or testing
hypothetical edits.
  We introduce text indexing with ephemeral substring edits, a new version of
text indexing. Our goal is to design a data structure over a given text that
supports subsequent pattern matching queries with ephemeral substring
insertions, deletions, or substitutions in the text; we require insertions and
substitutions to be of constant length. In particular, we preprocess a text
$T=T[0\mathinner{.\,.} n)$ over an integer alphabet $\Sigma=[0,\sigma)$ with
$\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. Then, we can preprocess
any arbitrary pattern $P=P[0\mathinner{.\,.} m)$ given online in
$\mathcal{O}(m\log\log m)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(m)$ space and allow any
ephemeral sequence of edit operations in $T$. Before reverting the $i$th
operation, we report all Occ occurrences of $P$ in $T^i$ in
$\mathcal{O}(\log\log n + \text{Occ})$ time.
  We also introduce pattern matching with ephemeral edits. In particular, we
preprocess two strings $T$ and $P$, each of length at most $n$, over an integer
alphabet $\Sigma=[0,\sigma)$ with $\sigma=n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ in
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. Then, we allow any ephemeral sequence of edit operations
in $T$. Before reverting the $i$th operation, we report all Occ occurrences of
$P$ in $T^i$ in the optimal $\mathcal{O}(\text{Occ})$ time. Along our way to
this result, we also give an optimal solution for pattern matching with
ephemeral block deletions.

Method: 改进的算法避免了使用O(m)大小的顶点栈或存储每条边的信息，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Result: 算法在保持线性时间复杂度的同时，显著减少了内存使用，特别适用于密集图或多重图。

Conclusion: 该算法易于实现且内存高效，但其正确性证明较为复杂，适用于需要节省空间的应用场景。

Abstract: We describe a simple variant of Hierholzer's algorithm that finds an Eulerian
cycle in a (multi)graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges using $\mathrm{O}(n \lg
m)$ bits of working memory. This substantially improves the working space
compared to standard implementations of Hierholzer's algorithm, which use
$\mathrm{O}(m \lg n)$ bits of space. Our algorithm runs in linear time, like
the classical versions, but avoids an $\mathrm{O}(m)$-size stack of vertices or
storing information for each edge. To our knowledge, this is the first
linear-time algorithm to achieve this space bound, and the method is very easy
to implement. The correctness argument, by contrast, is surprisingly subtle; we
give a detailed formal proof. The space savings are particularly relevant for
dense graphs or multigraphs with large edge multiplicities.

Abstract: In this paper, we present fixed-parameter tractability algorithms for both
the undirected and directed versions of the Spanning Tree Isomorphism Problem,
parameterized by the size $k$ of a redundant set. A redundant set is a
collection of edges whose removal transforms the graph into a spanning tree.
For the undirected version, our algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(n^2
\log n \cdot 2^{k \log k})$. For the directed version, we propose a more
efficient algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n^2 \cdot 2^{4k-3})$, where
$n$ is the number of vertices.

Abstract: Graph clustering is an important algorithmic technique for analysing massive
graphs, and has been widely applied in many research fields of data science.
While the objective of most graph clustering algorithms is to find a vertex set
of low conductance, a sequence of recent studies highlights the importance of
the inter-connection between vertex sets when analysing real-world datasets.
Following this line of research, in this work we study bipartite-like clusters
and present efficient and online sparsification algorithms that find such
clusters in both undirected graphs and directed ones. We conduct experimental
studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that our algorithms
significantly speedup the running time of existing clustering algorithms while
preserving their effectiveness.

TL;DR: 研究了Isometric Path Partition问题的参数化复杂度，证明其在树宽参数下是W[1]-hard的，并设计了动态规划算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多基于度量的图问题无法用固定大小的MSO公式表达，需要单独研究以确定树宽参数化的适用边界。

Method: 通过动态规划算法解决Isometric Path Partition问题，时间复杂度为n^O(tw)和diam^O(tw^2)·n^O(1)。

Result: 证明问题在树宽参数下是W[1]-hard的，并排除了更高效算法的可能性。

Conclusion: Isometric Path Partition问题在树宽参数下具有较高的计算复杂度，动态规划算法是当前最优解。

Abstract: We investigate the parameterized complexity of the Isometric Path Partition
problem when parameterized by the treewidth ($\mathrm{tw}$) of the input graph,
arguably one of the most widely studied parameters. Courcelle's theorem shows
that graph problems that are expressible as MSO formulas of constant size admit
FPT algorithms parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. This
encompasses many natural graph problems. However, many metric-based graph
problems, where the solution is defined using some metric-based property of the
graph (often the distance) are not expressible as MSO formulas of constant
size. These types of problems, Isometric Path Partition being one of them,
require individual attention and often draw the boundary for the success story
of parameterization by treewidth.
  In this paper, we prove that Isometric Path Partition is $W[1]$-hard when
parameterized by treewidth (in fact, even pathwidth), answering the question by
Dumas et al. [SIDMA, 2024], Fernau et al. [CIAC, 2023], and confirming the
aforementioned tendency. We complement this hardness result by designing a
tailored dynamic programming algorithm running in $n^{O(\mathrm{tw})}$ time.
This dynamic programming approach also results in an algorithm running in time
$\textrm{diam}^{O(\mathrm{tw}^2)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $\textrm{diam}$ is the
diameter of the graph. Note that the dependency on treewidth is unusually high,
as most problems admit algorithms running in time $2^{O(\mathrm{tw})}\cdot
n^{O(1)}$ or $2^{O(\mathrm{tw} \log (\mathrm{tw}))}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. However, we
rule out the possibility of a significantly faster algorithm by proving that
Isometric Path Partition does not admit an algorithm running in time
$\textrm{diam}^{o(\mathrm{tw}^2/(\log^3(\mathrm{tw})))} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, unless
the Randomized-ETH fails.

Motivation: CARP是运筹学中的重要问题，但自1993年以来其近似比未得到改进。基于CVRP的最新进展，作者试图提升CARP的近似比。

Method: 基于CVRP的近似算法进展，提出了一种新的近似算法。

Result: 提出了一个$(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-近似算法，首次超越了Jansen的界限。

Conclusion: 本文在CARP问题的近似算法上取得了突破，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP), introduced by Golden and Wong in
1981, is an important arc routing problem in Operations Research, which
generalizes the famous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). When every
customer has a unit demand, the best known approximation ratio for CARP, given
by Jansen in 1993, remains $\frac{5}{2}-\frac{1.5}{k}$, where $k$ denotes the
vehicle capacity. Based on recent progress in approximating CVRP, we improve
this result by proposing a
$(\frac{5}{2}-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation algorithm, which to
the best of our knowledge constitutes the first improvement over Jansen's
bound.

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究过于关注攻击成功率（ASR），忽略了生成的响应是否真正满足攻击者的恶意意图，导致输出质量低。

Method: JPS结合目标导向的视觉图像扰动和优化的文本引导提示，通过多智能体系统协同优化，实现高效攻击。

Result: 实验表明JPS在ASR和恶意意图实现率（MIFR）上均达到最新水平。

Conclusion: JPS通过视觉和文本协同优化，显著提升了攻击效果，并提出了MIFR作为评估指标。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks against multimodal large language Models (MLLMs) are a
significant research focus. Current research predominantly focuses on
maximizing attack success rate (ASR), often overlooking whether the generated
responses actually fulfill the attacker's malicious intent. This oversight
frequently leads to low-quality outputs that bypass safety filters but lack
substantial harmful content. To address this gap, we propose JPS,
\underline{J}ailbreak MLLMs with collaborative visual \underline{P}erturbation
and textual \underline{S}teering, which achieves jailbreaks via corporation of
visual image and textually steering prompt. Specifically, JPS utilizes
target-guided adversarial image perturbations for effective safety bypass,
complemented by "steering prompt" optimized via a multi-agent system to
specifically guide LLM responses fulfilling the attackers' intent. These visual
and textual components undergo iterative co-optimization for enhanced
performance. To evaluate the quality of attack outcomes, we propose the
Malicious Intent Fulfillment Rate (MIFR) metric, assessed using a
Reasoning-LLM-based evaluator. Our experiments show JPS sets a new
state-of-the-art in both ASR and MIFR across various MLLMs and benchmarks, with
analyses confirming its efficacy. Codes are available at

Motivation: 解决LLM代码生成在创意编码中缺乏多样性及无法直接关联音频输出的问题。

Method: 研究代码与音频嵌入空间的拓扑关系，构建预测模型以学习代码与音频嵌入的对齐映射。

Result: 发现代码与音频嵌入空间非线性关系，成功构建预测模型以对齐映射。

Conclusion: 通过构建代码-音频嵌入对齐映射，提升了创意编码中代码生成的多样性与音频输出关联性。

Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative
coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural
motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users
may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize
their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present
unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's
audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and
produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and
audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a
simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive
model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the
aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts
output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.

Motivation: 当前法律案例检索方法过于依赖事实相似性，缺乏对法律问题的关注和解释，导致检索结果与法律专业人士需求不符。

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）和结构化摘要，结合Augmented Question-guided Retrieval（AQgR）框架，生成针对性法律问题以优化检索。

Result: 在FIRE 2019数据集子集上，平均精度（MAP）达到0.36，平均召回率（MAR）为0.67，显著优于现有基准（MAP 0.1573）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过从基于事实的检索转向基于法律问题的检索，提供了更符合法律专业人士需求的上下文相关结果，并通过AQgR框架进一步提升了检索的精确性。

Abstract: Identifying relevant legal precedents remains challenging, as most retrieval
methods emphasize factual similarity over legal issues, and current systems
often lack explanations clarifying case relevance. This paper proposes the use
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this gap by facilitating the
retrieval of relevant cases, generating explanations to elucidate relevance,
and identifying core legal issues all autonomously, without requiring legal
expertise. Our approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with
structured summaries optimized for Indian case law. Leveraging the Augmented
Question-guided Retrieval (AQgR) framework, the system generates targeted legal
questions based on factual scenarios to identify relevant case law more
effectively. The structured summaries were assessed manually by legal experts,
given the absence of a suitable structured summary dataset. Case law retrieval
was evaluated using the FIRE dataset, and explanations were reviewed by legal
experts, as explanation generation alongside case retrieval is an emerging
innovation. Experimental evaluation on a subset of the FIRE 2019 dataset
yielded promising outcomes, achieving a Mean Average Precision (MAP) score of
0.36 and a Mean Average Recall (MAR) of 0.67 across test queries, significantly
surpassing the current MAP benchmark of 0.1573. This work introduces a suite of
novel contributions to advance case law retrieval. By transitioning from
fact-based to legal-issue-based retrieval, the proposed approach delivers more
contextually relevant results that align closely with legal professionals'
needs. Integrating legal questions within the retrieval process through the
AQgR framework ensures more precise and meaningful retrieval by refining the
context of queries.

Motivation: 大规模推荐系统需要处理高基数和非平稳数据，现有方法在扩展序列长度时面临内存和计算效率的挑战。

Method: 引入支持不规则张量的上下文并行技术，结合分布式数据并行，优化HSTU注意力模型的序列处理能力。

Result: 实现了5.3倍的序列长度扩展和1.55倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为推荐系统的序列建模提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are pivotal to process an immense volume
of daily user interactions, requiring the effective modeling of high
cardinality and heterogeneous features to ensure accurate predictions. In prior
work, we introduced Hierarchical Sequential Transducers (HSTU), an
attention-based architecture for modeling high cardinality, non-stationary
streaming recommendation data, providing good scaling law in the generative
recommender framework (GR). Recent studies and experiments demonstrate that
attending to longer user history sequences yields significant metric
improvements. However, scaling sequence length is activation-heavy,
necessitating parallelism solutions to effectively shard activation memory. In
transformer-based LLMs, context parallelism (CP) is a commonly used technique
that distributes computation along the sequence-length dimension across
multiple GPUs, effectively reducing memory usage from attention activations. In
contrast, production ranking models typically utilize jagged input tensors to
represent user interaction features, introducing unique CP implementation
challenges. In this work, we introduce context parallelism with jagged tensor
support for HSTU attention, establishing foundational capabilities for scaling
up sequence dimensions. Our approach enables a 5.3x increase in supported user
interaction sequence length, while achieving a 1.55x scaling factor when
combined with Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP).

Conclusion: LIS是一种高效且实用的评估指标，能够显著提升多模态推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a critical technique in modern
recommender systems, leveraging content representations from advanced
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To ensure these representations are
well-adapted, alignment with the recommender system is essential. However,
evaluating the alignment of MLLMs for recommendation presents significant
challenges due to three key issues: (1) static benchmarks are inaccurate
because of the dynamism in real-world applications, (2) evaluations with online
system, while accurate, are prohibitively expensive at scale, and (3)
conventional metrics fail to provide actionable insights when learned
representations underperform. To address these challenges, we propose the
Leakage Impact Score (LIS), a novel metric for multimodal recommendation.
Rather than directly assessing MLLMs, LIS efficiently measures the upper bound
of preference data. We also share practical insights on deploying MLLMs with
LIS in real-world scenarios. Online A/B tests on both Content Feed and Display
Ads of Xiaohongshu's Explore Feed production demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method, showing significant improvements in user spent time and
advertiser value.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems are increasingly popular for their
potential to improve performance by integrating diverse data types. However,
the actual benefits of this integration remain unclear, raising questions about
when and how it truly enhances recommendations. In this paper, we propose a
structured evaluation framework to systematically assess multimodal
recommendations across four dimensions: Comparative Efficiency, Recommendation
Tasks, Recommendation Stages, and Multimodal Data Integration. We benchmark a
set of reproducible multimodal models against strong traditional baselines and
evaluate their performance on different platforms. Our findings show that
multimodal data is particularly beneficial in sparse interaction scenarios and
during the recall stage of recommendation pipelines. We also observe that the
importance of each modality is task-specific, where text features are more
useful in e-commerce and visual features are more effective in short-video
recommendations. Additionally, we explore different integration strategies and
model sizes, finding that Ensemble-Based Learning outperforms Fusion-Based
Learning, and that larger models do not necessarily deliver better results. To
deepen our understanding, we include case studies and review findings from
other recommendation domains. Our work provides practical insights for building
efficient and effective multimodal recommendation systems, emphasizing the need
for thoughtful modality selection, integration strategies, and model design.

Result: 在四个跨域序列推荐数据集上验证了HorizonRec的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HorizonRec通过扩散模型实现了细粒度的多域偏好融合，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Personalized sequential recommendation aims to predict appropriate items for
users based on their behavioral sequences. To alleviate data sparsity and
interest drift issues, conventional approaches typically incorporate auxiliary
behaviors from other domains via cross-domain transition. However, existing
cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) methods often follow an
align-then-fusion paradigm that performs representation-level alignment across
multiple domains and combines them mechanically for recommendation, overlooking
the fine-grained fusion of domain-specific preferences. Inspired by recent
advances in diffusion models (DMs) for distribution matching, we propose an
align-for-fusion framework for CDSR to harmonize triple preferences via
dual-oriented DMs, termed HorizonRec. Specifically, we investigate the
uncertainty injection of DMs and identify stochastic noise as a key source of
instability in existing DM-based recommenders. To address this, we introduce a
mixed-conditioned distribution retrieval strategy that leverages distributions
retrieved from users' authentic behavioral logic as semantic bridges across
domains, enabling consistent multi-domain preference modeling. Furthermore, we
propose a dual-oriented preference diffusion method to suppress potential noise
and emphasize target-relevant interests during multi-domain user representation
fusion. Extensive experiments on four CDSR datasets from two distinct platforms
demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of HorizonRec in fine-grained
triple-domain preference fusion.

Abstract: We propose a novel End-to-end Multi-objective Ensemble Ranking framework
(EMER) for the multi-objective ensemble ranking module, which is the most
critical component of the short video recommendation system. EMER enhances
personalization by replacing manually-designed heuristic formulas with an
end-to-end modeling paradigm. EMER introduces a meticulously designed loss
function to address the fundamental challenge of defining effective supervision
for ensemble ranking, where no single ground-truth signal can fully capture
user satisfaction. Moreover, EMER introduces novel sample organization method
and transformer-based network architecture to capture the comparative
relationships among candidates, which are critical for effective ranking.
Additionally, we have proposed an offline-online consistent evaluation system
to enhance the efficiency of offline model optimization, which is an
established yet persistent challenge within the multi-objective ranking domain
in industry. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a real industrial
dataset, and the results well demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
framework. In addition, our framework has been deployed in the primary
scenarios of Kuaishou, a short video recommendation platform with hundreds of
millions of daily active users, achieving a 1.39% increase in overall App Stay
Time and a 0.196% increase in 7-day user Lifetime(LT7), which are substantial
improvements.

Abstract: With the rapid and continuous increase in academic publications, identifying
high-quality research has become an increasingly pressing challenge. While
recent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper
evaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated
domain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present
PaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that
addresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper
retrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support
contextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent
reasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and
methodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related
work, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation. To guide the reasoning
process, we introduce a progressive ranking optimization strategy that
encourages the LLM to iteratively refine its predictions with an emphasis on
relative comparison. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that PaperEval
consistently outperforms existing methods in both academic impact and paper
quality evaluation. In addition, we deploy PaperEval in a real-world paper
recommendation system for filtering high-quality papers, which has gained
strong engagement on social media -- amassing over 8,000 subscribers and
attracting over 10,000 views for many filtered high-quality papers --
demonstrating the practical effectiveness of PaperEval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI工具数量的增加，将所有工具信息整合到有限模型上下文中变得不切实际，现有检索方法主要基于语义相似性，但忽视了工具间的依赖关系，可能导致任务执行失败。

Method: 首先构建TDI300K数据集训练依赖关系判别器，然后将候选工具表示为依赖图，利用图卷积整合依赖关系，最后使用更新后的工具表示进行在线检索。

Result: 实验结果表明，TGR在多个常用数据集上提升了现有方法的性能，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: TGR验证了工具依赖关系的重要性及其有效性，为工具检索提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped
tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the
limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient
tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on
semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve
relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently,
overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of
prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in
this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the
dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval.
First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for
identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool
dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into
their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed
for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets
show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant
methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于子ID级个性化流行度评分（sPPS）的方法，改进了音乐推荐中的重复收听模式建模，平衡了准确性和新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐推荐中重复收听行为普遍，但现有方法（如PPS）倾向于推荐已知内容，缺乏新颖性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 在RecJPQ框架中引入子ID级个性化流行度评分（sPPS），通过子嵌入捕捉更细粒度的重复模式，平衡准确性和新颖性。

Result: sPPS在保持推荐准确性的同时，显著提高了个性化新颖性，优于传统的PPS方法。

Conclusion: 子ID级建模能有效捕捉重复模式，提升推荐系统的新颖性，代码和实验已公开。

Abstract: In the realm of music recommendation, sequential recommenders have shown
promise in capturing the dynamic nature of music consumption. A key
characteristic of this domain is repetitive listening, where users frequently
replay familiar tracks. To capture these repetition patterns, recent research
has introduced Personalised Popularity Scores (PPS), which quantify
user-specific preferences based on historical frequency. While PPS enhances
relevance in recommendation, it often reinforces already-known content,
limiting the system's ability to surface novel or serendipitous items - key
elements for fostering long-term user engagement and satisfaction. To address
this limitation, we build upon RecJPQ, a Transformer-based framework initially
developed to improve scalability in large-item catalogues through sub-item
decomposition. We repurpose RecJPQ's sub-item architecture to model
personalised popularity at a finer granularity. This allows us to capture
shared repetition patterns across sub-embeddings - latent structures not
accessible through item-level popularity alone. We propose a novel integration
of sub-ID-level personalised popularity within the RecJPQ framework, enabling
explicit control over the trade-off between accuracy and personalised novelty.
Our sub-ID-level PPS method (sPPS) consistently outperforms item-level PPS by
achieving significantly higher personalised novelty without compromising
recommendation accuracy. Code and experiments are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统的解释常基于用户评论，混淆了用户意见与系统逻辑，导致解释虽流畅但未能真实反映推荐原因。

Method: 提出FIRE框架，结合SHAP特征归因和结构化提示生成语言，生成忠实、多样且用户对齐的解释。

Result: FIRE在推荐准确性和解释质量（如对齐性、结构性和忠实性）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 需超越评论即解释的范式，发展更可问责和可解释的方法。

Abstract: Natural language explanations in recommender systems are often framed as a
review generation task, leveraging user reviews as ground-truth supervision.
While convenient, this approach conflates a user's opinion with the system's
reasoning, leading to explanations that may be fluent but fail to reflect the
true logic behind recommendations. In this work, we revisit the core objective
of explainable recommendation: to transparently communicate why an item is
recommended by linking user needs to relevant item features. Through a
comprehensive analysis of existing methods across multiple benchmark datasets,
we identify common limitations-explanations that are weakly aligned with model
predictions, vague or inaccurate in identifying user intents, and overly
repetitive or generic. To overcome these challenges, we propose FIRE, a
lightweight and interpretable framework that combines SHAP-based feature
attribution with structured, prompt-driven language generation. FIRE produces
faithful, diverse, and user-aligned explanations, grounded in the actual
decision-making process of the model. Our results demonstrate that FIRE not
only achieves competitive recommendation accuracy but also significantly
improves explanation quality along critical dimensions such as alignment,
structure, and faithfulness. This work highlights the need to move beyond the
review-as-explanation paradigm and toward explanation methods that are both
accountable and interpretable.

Result: 通过不同本体和使用场景的案例研究，验证了系统在数据探索和领域图谱分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统通过直观的差异展示和自然语言支持，提升了知识图谱的探索性和可用性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) contain vast amounts of linked resources that encode
knowledge in various domains, which can be queried and searched for using
specialized languages like SPARQL, a query language developed to query KGs.
Existing visual query builders enable non-expert users to construct SPARQL
queries and utilize the knowledge contained in these graphs. Query building is,
however, an iterative and, often, visual process where the question of the user
can change and differ throughout the process, especially for explorative
search. Our visual querying interface communicates these change between
iterative steps in the query building process using graph differences to
contrast the changes and the evolution in the graph query. We also enable users
to formulate their evolving information needs using a natural language
interface directly integrated into the difference query view. We, furthermore,
communicate the change in results in the result view by contrasting the
differences in both result distribution and individual instances of the
prototype graph and demonstrate the system's applicability through case studies
on different ontologies and usage scenarios, illustrating how our system
fosters, both, data exploration and analysis of domain-specific graphs.

Result: 在基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M$^3$BSR有效解决了多模态多行为推荐中的关键挑战，提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: The sequential recommendation system utilizes historical user interactions to
predict preferences. Effectively integrating diverse user behavior patterns
with rich multimodal information of items to enhance the accuracy of sequential
recommendations is an emerging and challenging research direction. This paper
focuses on the problem of multi-modal multi-behavior sequential recommendation,
aiming to address the following challenges: (1) the lack of effective
characterization of modal preferences across different behaviors, as user
attention to different item modalities varies depending on the behavior; (2)
the difficulty of effectively mitigating implicit noise in user behavior, such
as unintended actions like accidental clicks; (3) the inability to handle
modality noise in multi-modal representations, which further impacts the
accurate modeling of user preferences. To tackle these issues, we propose a
novel Multi-Modal Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation model (M$^3$BSR).
This model first removes noise in multi-modal representations using a
Conditional Diffusion Modality Denoising Layer. Subsequently, it utilizes deep
behavioral information to guide the denoising of shallow behavioral data,
thereby alleviating the impact of noise in implicit feedback through
Conditional Diffusion Behavior Denoising. Finally, by introducing a
Multi-Expert Interest Extraction Layer, M$^3$BSR explicitly models the common
and specific interests across behaviors and modalities to enhance
recommendation performance. Experimental results indicate that M$^3$BSR
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线评估在推荐系统基准测试中至关重要，但存在曝光偏差和采样偏差问题，现有方法多基于固定日志数据集，缺乏对模型比较可靠性的全面评估。

Method: 通过完全观测数据集作为真实基准，系统模拟多种曝光偏差，评估常见采样策略在分辨率、保真度、鲁棒性和预测能力四个维度的表现。

Result: 研究发现采样策略会扭曲评估结果，并揭示了不同策略在特定条件下的表现优劣。

Conclusion: 研究为选择可靠且稳健的离线评估策略提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Offline evaluation plays a central role in benchmarking recommender systems
when online testing is impractical or risky. However, it is susceptible to two
key sources of bias: exposure bias, where users only interact with items they
are shown, and sampling bias, introduced when evaluation is performed on a
subset of logged items rather than the full catalog. While prior work has
proposed methods to mitigate sampling bias, these are typically assessed on
fixed logged datasets rather than for their ability to support reliable model
comparisons under varying exposure conditions or relative to true user
preferences. In this paper, we investigate how different combinations of
logging and sampling choices affect the reliability of offline evaluation.
Using a fully observed dataset as ground truth, we systematically simulate
diverse exposure biases and assess the reliability of common sampling
strategies along four dimensions: sampling resolution (recommender model
separability), fidelity (agreement with full evaluation), robustness (stability
under exposure bias), and predictive power (alignment with ground truth). Our
findings highlight when and how sampling distorts evaluation outcomes and offer
practical guidance for selecting strategies that yield faithful and robust
offline comparisons.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document
reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable,
user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a
unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval
pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based

with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end
RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback
through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with
auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality
ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling
comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations.
All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used
to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy
selectors. Our platform is publicly available at https://rankarena.ngrok.io/,

Abstract: Live streaming platforms have become a dominant form of online content
consumption, offering dynamically evolving content, real-time interactions, and
highly engaging user experiences. These unique characteristics introduce new
challenges that differentiate live streaming recommendation from traditional
recommendation settings and have garnered increasing attention from industry in
recent years. However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the
lack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature
of live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the
first real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live
streaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The
dataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over
a 21-day period. Compared to existing datasets, KuaiLive offers several
advantages: it includes precise live room start and end timestamps, multiple
types of real-time user interactions (click, comment, like, gift), and rich
side information features for both users and streamers. These features enable
more realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of
user and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from
multiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation
methods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research. KuaiLive
can support a wide range of tasks in the live streaming domain, such as top-K
recommendation, click-through rate prediction, watch time prediction, and gift
price prediction. Moreover, its fine-grained behavioral data also enables
research on multi-behavior modeling, multi-task learning, and fairness-aware
recommendation. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该研究推动了LLM在工业维护中的应用，为跨机械组件和工业领域的预测性维护提供了可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Industrial machinery maintenance requires timely intervention to prevent
catastrophic failures and optimize operational efficiency. This paper presents
an integrated Large Language Model (LLM)-based intelligent system for
prescriptive maintenance that extends beyond traditional anomaly detection to
provide actionable maintenance recommendations. Building upon our prior LAMP
framework for numerical data analysis, we develop a comprehensive solution that
combines bearing vibration frequency analysis with multi agentic generation for
intelligent maintenance planning. Our approach serializes bearing vibration
data (BPFO, BPFI, BSF, FTF frequencies) into natural language for LLM
processing, enabling few-shot anomaly detection with high accuracy. The system
classifies fault types (inner race, outer race, ball/roller, cage faults) and
assesses severity levels. A multi-agentic component processes maintenance
manuals using vector embeddings and semantic search, while also conducting web
searches to retrieve comprehensive procedural knowledge and access up-to-date
maintenance practices for more accurate and in-depth recommendations. The
Gemini model then generates structured maintenance recommendations includes
immediate actions, inspection checklists, corrective measures, parts
requirements, and timeline specifications. Experimental validation in bearing
vibration datasets demonstrates effective anomaly detection and contextually
relevant maintenance guidance. The system successfully bridges the gap between
condition monitoring and actionable maintenance planning, providing industrial
practitioners with intelligent decision support. This work advances the
application of LLMs in industrial maintenance, offering a scalable framework
for prescriptive maintenance across machinery components and industrial
sectors.

Motivation: 棋盘游戏作为战略推理和智能的典型领域，长期以来是评估AI系统的基准。论文旨在通过对抗性游戏全面评估LLMs的性能。

Method: 引入Qi Town平台，支持5种游戏和20个LLM驱动的玩家，使用Elo评分系统和性能循环图（PLG）定量评估LLMs技术能力，并通过积极情绪评分（PSS）评估心理适应性。

Result: 实验表明，尽管技术差异，大多数LLMs对输赢保持乐观，比人类更能适应高压对抗环境；PLG揭示了LLMs技能表现的不稳定性。

Conclusion: 对抗性游戏是评估LLMs的有效方法，但LLMs在游戏中的技能不稳定性需进一步研究。

Abstract: Adversarial board games, as a paradigmatic domain of strategic reasoning and
intelligence, have long served as both a popular competitive activity and a
benchmark for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Building on this
foundation, we propose an adversarial benchmarking framework to assess the
comprehensive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through board games
competition, compensating the limitation of data dependency of the mainstream
Question-and-Answer (Q&A) based benchmark method. We introduce Qi Town, a
specialized evaluation platform that supports 5 widely played games and
involves 20 LLM-driven players. The platform employs both the Elo rating system
and a novel Performance Loop Graph (PLG) to quantitatively evaluate the
technical capabilities of LLMs, while also capturing Positive Sentiment Score
(PSS) throughout gameplay to assess mental fitness. The evaluation is
structured as a round-robin tournament, enabling systematic comparison across
players. Experimental results indicate that, despite technical differences,
most LLMs remain optimistic about winning and losing, demonstrating greater
adaptability to high-stress adversarial environments than humans. On the other
hand, the complex relationship between cyclic wins and losses in PLGs exposes
the instability of LLMs' skill play during games, warranting further
explanation and exploration.

Motivation: 当前基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）解决方案存在隐私和可扩展性问题，需要持续互联网连接，本研究旨在探索更高效、隐私友好的替代方案。

Method: 比较了三种方法：（1）基于云LLM的全自动在线方法；（2）基于传统机器学习分类器的半自动离线方法；（3）基于客户端微调SLM的全自主离线方法。

Result: 第三种方法（SLM）在准确性上表现最佳，精确匹配准确率为0.93，Levenshtein相似度为0.99，ROUGE-1和ROUGE-L分数为0.98，同时减轻了服务器负担。

Conclusion: 客户端计算的SLM方法不仅高效且隐私友好，为AWebGIS提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous web-based geographical information systems (AWebGIS) aim to
perform geospatial operations from natural language input, providing intuitive,
intelligent, and hands-free interaction. However, most current solutions rely
on cloud-based large language models (LLMs), which require continuous internet
access and raise users' privacy and scalability issues due to centralized
server processing. This study compares three approaches to enabling AWebGIS:
(1) a fully-automated online method using cloud-based LLMs (e.g., Cohere); (2)
a semi-automated offline method using classical machine learning classifiers
such as support vector machine and random forest; and (3) a fully autonomous
offline (client-side) method based on a fine-tuned small language model (SLM),
specifically T5-small model, executed in the client's web browser. The third
approach, which leverages SLMs, achieved the highest accuracy among all
methods, with an exact matching accuracy of 0.93, Levenshtein similarity of
0.99, and recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores of 0.98. Crucially, this client-side computation strategy reduces the
load on backend servers by offloading processing to the user's device,
eliminating the need for server-based inference. These results highlight the
feasibility of browser-executable models for AWebGIS solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with policy-gradient
algorithms dominating the post-training stage because of their efficiency and
effectiveness. However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model
reasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,
non-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with
practical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and
contextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by
brain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect
inputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We
fine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)
using RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their
performance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL
fine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance
declines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical
limitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a
scenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave
these reasoning deficits largely unresolved. This work highlights that the
reasoning abilities of large models are often overstated and underscores the
importance of evaluating models under non-ideal scenarios. The code and data
will be released at XXXX.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Result: 实验显示LoopPlay在预测准确结合模式上比现有方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: 该框架有望提升药物发现中分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a crucial aspect of drug discovery, as it predicts the
binding interactions between small-molecule ligands and protein pockets.
However, current multi-task learning models for docking often show inferior
performance in ligand docking compared to protein pocket docking. This
disparity arises largely due to the distinct structural complexities of ligands
and proteins. To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic
framework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game
called the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand
player and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve
this game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which
alternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,
the players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's
structural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple
iterations. In the inner loop, each player dynamically refines its predictions
by incorporating its own predicted ligand or pocket poses back into its model.
We theoretically show the convergence of LoopPlay, ensuring stable
optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that LoopPlay achieves approximately a 10\% improvement in
predicting accurate binding modes compared to previous state-of-the-art
methods. This highlights its potential to enhance the accuracy of molecular
docking in drug discovery.

experts in integrating large, heterogeneous, and noisy urban spatial datasets.
Traditional rule-based integration methods are unable to cover all edge cases,
requiring manual verification and repair. Machine learning approaches require
collecting and labeling of large numbers of task-specific samples. In this
study, we investigate the potential of LLMs for spatial data integration. Our
analysis first considers how LLMs reason about environmental spatial
relationships mediated by human experience, such as between roads and
sidewalks. We show that while LLMs exhibit spatial reasoning capabilities, they
struggle to connect the macro-scale environment with the relevant computational
geometry tasks, often producing logically incoherent responses. But when
provided relevant features, thereby reducing dependence on spatial reasoning,
LLMs are able to generate high-performing results. We then adapt a
review-and-refine method, which proves remarkably effective in correcting
erroneous initial responses while preserving accurate responses. We discuss
practical implications of employing LLMs for spatial data integration in
real-world contexts and outline future research directions, including
post-training, multi-modal integration methods, and support for diverse data
formats. Our findings position LLMs as a promising and flexible alternative to
traditional rule-based heuristics, advancing the capabilities of adaptive
spatial data integration.

TL;DR: 论文提出CogniWeb框架，通过结合快速直觉处理（System 1）和慢速推理（System 2）来提升网络导航任务的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络导航是评估通用人工智能（AGI）的重要领域，但现有方法未能有效整合离线模仿学习和在线探索。

Method: 受人类认知双过程理论启发，提出CogniWeb框架，动态切换快速直觉和慢速推理模式。

Result: 在WebArena测试中，CogniWeb达到43.96%的成功率，同时减少75%的token使用。

Conclusion: CogniWeb通过双过程理论有效提升了网络导航任务的性能与效率。

Abstract: Web navigation represents a critical and challenging domain for evaluating
artificial general intelligence (AGI), demanding complex decision-making within
high-entropy, dynamic environments with combinatorially explosive action
spaces. Current approaches to building autonomous web agents either focus on
offline imitation learning or online exploration, but rarely integrate both
paradigms effectively. Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition,
we derive a principled decomposition into fast System 1 and slow System 2
cognitive processes. This decomposition provides a unifying perspective on
existing web agent methodologies, bridging the gap between offline learning of
intuitive reactive behaviors and online acquisition of deliberative planning
capabilities. We implement this framework in CogniWeb, a modular agent
architecture that adaptively toggles between fast intuitive processing and
deliberate reasoning based on task complexity. Our evaluation on WebArena
demonstrates that CogniWeb achieves competitive performance (43.96% success
rate) while maintaining significantly higher efficiency (75% reduction in token
usage).

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态医学知识编辑基准MedMKEB，用于评估医学大语言模型在知识编辑中的可靠性、通用性等性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学知识不断更新，现有模型需高效更新知识而无需从头训练，但目前缺乏针对多模态医学知识编辑的系统性基准。

Method: 基于高质量医学视觉问答数据集构建MedMKEB，包含反事实修正、语义泛化等任务，并通过专家验证确保准确性。

Result: 实验表明现有知识编辑方法在医学领域存在局限性，需开发专门策略。

Conclusion: MedMKEB将作为标准基准，推动可信赖且高效的医学知识编辑算法发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved medical AI, enabling it to unify the understanding of
visual and textual information. However, as medical knowledge continues to
evolve, it is critical to allow these models to efficiently update outdated or
incorrect information without retraining from scratch. Although textual
knowledge editing has been widely studied, there is still a lack of systematic
benchmarks for multimodal medical knowledge editing involving image and text
modalities. To fill this gap, we present MedMKEB, the first comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the reliability, generality, locality,
portability, and robustness of knowledge editing in medical multimodal large
language models. MedMKEB is built on a high-quality medical visual
question-answering dataset and enriched with carefully constructed editing
tasks, including counterfactual correction, semantic generalization, knowledge
transfer, and adversarial robustness. We incorporate human expert validation to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark. Extensive single editing
and sequential editing experiments on state-of-the-art general and medical
MLLMs demonstrate the limitations of existing knowledge-based editing
approaches in medicine, highlighting the need to develop specialized editing
strategies. MedMKEB will serve as a standard benchmark to promote the
development of trustworthy and efficient medical knowledge editing algorithms.

TL;DR: EasySize是一个基于Qwen3-8B模型的轻量级门尺寸优化框架，适用于不同工艺节点和电路拓扑，显著减少计算资源和人工依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路设计耗时且依赖经验，现有AI方法通用性差且计算资源需求高。

Method: 结合微调Qwen3-8B模型和动态任务特定损失函数，通过全局差分进化和局部粒子群优化进行启发式搜索。

Result: 在多个工艺节点上表现优异，优于AutoCkt，减少86.67%任务的计算资源。

Conclusion: EasySize能加速模拟电路设计，减少对专家和计算资源的依赖。

Abstract: Analog circuit design is a time-consuming, experience-driven task in chip
development. Despite advances in AI, developing universal, fast, and stable
gate sizing methods for analog circuits remains a significant challenge. Recent
approaches combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with heuristic search
techniques to enhance generalizability, but they often depend on large model
sizes and lack portability across different technology nodes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose EasySize, the first lightweight gate sizing framework
based on a finetuned Qwen3-8B model, designed for universal applicability
across process nodes, design specifications, and circuit topologies. EasySize
exploits the varying Ease of Attainability (EOA) of performance metrics to
dynamically construct task-specific loss functions, enabling efficient
heuristic search through global Differential Evolution (DE) and local Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) within a feedback-enhanced flow. Although finetuned
solely on 350nm node data, EasySize achieves strong performance on 5
operational amplifier (Op-Amp) netlists across 180nm, 45nm, and 22nm technology
nodes without additional targeted training, and outperforms AutoCkt, a
widely-used Reinforcement Learning based sizing framework, on 86.67\% of tasks
with more than 96.67\% of simulation resources reduction. We argue that
EasySize can significantly reduce the reliance on human expertise and
computational resources in gate sizing, thereby accelerating and simplifying
the analog circuit design process. EasySize will be open-sourced at a later
date.

Abstract: Generative AI is no longer a peripheral tool in higher education. It is
rapidly evolving into a general-purpose infrastructure that reshapes how
knowledge is generated, mediated, and validated. This paper presents findings
from a controlled experiment evaluating a Socratic AI Tutor, a large language
model designed to scaffold student research question development through
structured dialogue grounded in constructivist theory. Conducted with 65
pre-service teacher students in Germany, the study compares interaction with
the Socratic Tutor to engagement with an uninstructed AI chatbot. Students
using the Socratic Tutor reported significantly greater support for critical,
independent, and reflective thinking, suggesting that dialogic AI can stimulate
metacognitive engagement and challenging recent narratives of de-skilling due
to generative AI usage. These findings serve as a proof of concept for a
broader pedagogical shift: the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of
specialised AI agents. To conceptualise this, we introduce the notion of
orchestrated MAS, modular, pedagogically aligned agent constellations, curated
by educators, that support diverse learning trajectories through differentiated
roles and coordinated interaction. To anchor this shift, we propose an adapted
offer-and-use model, in which students appropriate instructional offers from
these agents. Beyond technical feasibility, we examine system-level
implications for higher education institutions and students, including funding
necessities, changes to faculty roles, curriculars, competencies and assessment
practices. We conclude with a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis
highlighting the scalability of such systems. In sum, this study contributes
both empirical evidence and a conceptual roadmap for hybrid learning ecosystems
that embed human-AI co-agency and pedagogical alignment.

Motivation: 现实世界的事件日志常因数据采集问题导致信息缺失，现有方法依赖过程模型或机器学习，但无法全面修复所有属性。

Method: 开发了一种HGNN模型，能够处理不完整事件，并修复所有缺失属性。

Result: 在两个合成日志和四个真实日志上评估，表现优于基于自动编码器的现有方法。

Conclusion: HGNN方法在修复事件日志的所有属性上表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: The quality of event logs in Process Mining is crucial when applying any form
of analysis to them. In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be
non-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual
recording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and
often may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard
approaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the
availability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by
leveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep
Learning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In
recent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling
input data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph
Neural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,
offer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex
multi-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for
more expressive and semantically rich encodings.
  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural
Network model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will
return the full set of attributes missing from those events. We evaluate our
work against a state-of-the-art approach leveraging autoencoders on two
synthetic logs and four real event logs, on different types of missing values.
Different from state-of-the-art model-free approaches, which mainly focus on
repairing a subset of event attributes, the proposed approach shows very good
performance in reconstructing all different event attributes.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法仅从文本或图像中检索，无法满足复杂查询需求，如多跳推理或最新事实知识。

Method: QA-Dragon引入领域路由器和搜索路由器，动态选择检索策略，支持多模态、多轮和多跳推理。

Result: 在KDD Cup 2025的Meta CRAG-MM挑战中，QA-Dragon显著提升推理性能，单源任务提升5.06%，多源任务提升6.35%，多轮任务提升5.03%。

Conclusion: QA-Dragon通过动态多模态检索策略，有效解决了复杂VQA任务中的知识检索和推理问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to mitigate
hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge into the generation process, and it has become a widely
adopted approach for knowledge-intensive Visual Question Answering (VQA).
However, existing RAG methods typically retrieve from either text or images in
isolation, limiting their ability to address complex queries that require
multi-hop reasoning or up-to-date factual knowledge. To address this
limitation, we propose QA-Dragon, a Query-Aware Dynamic RAG System for
Knowledge-Intensive VQA. Specifically, QA-Dragon introduces a domain router to
identify the query's subject domain for domain-specific reasoning, along with a
search router that dynamically selects optimal retrieval strategies. By
orchestrating both text and image search agents in a hybrid setup, our system
supports multimodal, multi-turn, and multi-hop reasoning, enabling it to tackle
complex VQA tasks effectively. We evaluate our QA-Dragon on the Meta CRAG-MM
Challenge at KDD Cup 2025, where it significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of base models under challenging scenarios. Our framework achieves
substantial improvements in both answer accuracy and knowledge overlap scores,
outperforming baselines by 5.06% on the single-source task, 6.35% on the
multi-source task, and 5.03% on the multi-turn task.

providing transparent reasoning through a planning-orchestration architecture.
Our solution enables communication owners to formulate intuitive queries
combining concepts such as equipment, manufacturers, maintenance engineers, and
facilities, delivering explainable results that maintain trust in the system
while improving communication efficiency across the organization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中符号与神经模块松散耦合的问题，实现更紧密的集成，以提升推理性能和可解释性。

Method: 将决策树和随机森林作为可调用模块嵌入统一推理系统，结合LLM处理归纳推理和交互规划，由中央协调器维护状态一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如ProofWriter（+7.2%）、GSM8k（+5.3%）和ARC（+6.0%）。

Conclusion: 该架构为通用神经符号推理提供了鲁棒、可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid architecture that integrates decision tree-based symbolic
reasoning with the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within a coordinated multi-agent framework. Unlike prior approaches that
loosely couple symbolic and neural modules, our design embeds decision trees
and random forests as callable oracles within a unified reasoning system.
Tree-based modules enable interpretable rule inference and causal logic, while
LLM agents handle abductive reasoning, generalization, and interactive
planning. A central orchestrator maintains belief state consistency and
mediates communication across agents and external tools, enabling reasoning
over both structured and unstructured inputs.
  The system achieves strong performance on reasoning benchmarks. On
\textit{ProofWriter}, it improves entailment consistency by +7.2\% through
logic-grounded tree validation. On GSM8k, it achieves +5.3\% accuracy gains in
multistep mathematical problems via symbolic augmentation. On \textit{ARC}, it
boosts abstraction accuracy by +6.0\% through integration of symbolic oracles.
Applications in clinical decision support and scientific discovery show how the
system encodes domain rules symbolically while leveraging LLMs for contextual
inference and hypothesis generation. This architecture offers a robust,
interpretable, and extensible solution for general-purpose neuro-symbolic
reasoning.

Motivation: AI中'agent'一词的多义性导致研究交流、系统评估和政策制定的困难，需要重新定义以解决这些问题。

Method: 通过历史分析和当代使用模式，提出一个多维框架，定义'agent'的最低要求，并建议标准化术语和框架采纳。

Result: 提出的框架为系统描述提供了精确词汇，同时保留了术语的多面性，有助于研究清晰度和政策制定。

Conclusion: 建议采纳该框架和术语标准化，以改善研究可复现性和政策制定效果。

Abstract: The term 'agent' in artificial intelligence has long carried multiple
interpretations across different subfields. Recent developments in AI
capabilities, particularly in large language model systems, have amplified this
ambiguity, creating significant challenges in research communication, system
evaluation and reproducibility, and policy development. This paper argues that
the term 'agent' requires redefinition. Drawing from historical analysis and
contemporary usage patterns, we propose a framework that defines clear minimum
requirements for a system to be considered an agent while characterizing
systems along a multidimensional spectrum of environmental interaction,
learning and adaptation, autonomy, goal complexity, and temporal coherence.
This approach provides precise vocabulary for system description while
preserving the term's historically multifaceted nature. After examining
potential counterarguments and implementation challenges, we provide specific
recommendations for moving forward as a field, including suggestions for
terminology standardization and framework adoption. The proposed approach
offers practical tools for improving research clarity and reproducibility while
supporting more effective policy development.

Motivation: 理解LLM在开放多智能体环境中（尤其是涉及法律和伦理困境时）的行为仍有限，需要进一步研究。

Method: 使用NomicLaw模拟系统，让LLM协作制定法律，通过提出规则、论证和投票来量化信任与互惠，并定性分析语言策略。

Result: 实验显示LLM能自发形成联盟、背叛信任，并调整语言策略以影响集体决策，揭示了开源LLM的社会推理和说服能力。

Conclusion: 研究为未来AI系统在自主协商、协调和法律起草方面的设计提供了见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have extended their
capabilities from basic text processing to complex reasoning tasks, including
legal interpretation, argumentation, and strategic interaction. However,
empirical understanding of LLM behavior in open-ended, multi-agent settings
especially those involving deliberation over legal and ethical dilemmas remains
limited. We introduce NomicLaw, a structured multi-agent simulation where LLMs
engage in collaborative law-making, responding to complex legal vignettes by
proposing rules, justifying them, and voting on peer proposals. We
quantitatively measure trust and reciprocity via voting patterns and
qualitatively assess how agents use strategic language to justify proposals and
influence outcomes. Experiments involving homogeneous and heterogeneous LLM
groups demonstrate how agents spontaneously form alliances, betray trust, and
adapt their rhetoric to shape collective decisions. Our results highlight the
latent social reasoning and persuasive capabilities of ten open-source LLMs and
provide insights into the design of future AI systems capable of autonomous
negotiation, coordination and drafting legislation in legal settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了描述逻辑（DLs）中的最小模型推理问题，发现即使在简单的DL（如$\mathcal{EL}$）中，概念可满足性在最小模型中也是不可判定的。通过引入无环性条件，部分问题可恢复可判定性，但复杂度较高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最小模型推理在知识表示中很重要，但在描述逻辑中的研究有限，尤其是纯最小模型的情况尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究了不同DLs中的最小模型推理问题，分析了概念可满足性在最小模型中的可判定性，并引入无环性条件以恢复可判定性。

Result: 发现$\mathcal{EL}$中的概念可满足性在最小模型中不可判定；通过无环性条件部分恢复可判定性，但复杂度高达双指数时间。

Conclusion: 最小模型推理在描述逻辑中具有挑战性，即使简单DL也难以处理，但通过限制条件可部分解决。

Abstract: Reasoning with minimal models has always been at the core of many knowledge
representation techniques, but we still have only a limited understanding of
this problem in Description Logics (DLs). Minimization of some selected
predicates, letting the remaining predicates vary or be fixed, as proposed in
circumscription, has been explored and exhibits high complexity. The case of
`pure' minimal models, where the extension of all predicates must be minimal,
has remained largely uncharted. We address this problem in popular DLs and
obtain surprisingly negative results: concept satisfiability in minimal models
is undecidable already for $\mathcal{EL}$. This undecidability also extends to
a very restricted fragment of tuple-generating dependencies. To regain
decidability, we impose acyclicity conditions on the TBox that bring the
worst-case complexity below double exponential time and allow us to establish a
connection with the recently studied pointwise circumscription; we also derive
results in data complexity. We conclude with a brief excursion to the DL-Lite
family, where a positive result was known for DL-Lite$_{\text{core}}$, but our
investigation establishes ExpSpace-hardness already for its extension
DL-Lite$_{\text{horn}}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励机制仅提供整体二元评分，无法适应多部分问题的复杂推理需求。

Method: StructVRM通过训练模型验证器，提供细粒度的子问题级反馈，评估语义和数学等价性。

Result: Seed-StructVRM在12个多模态基准测试中的6个及新STEM-Bench上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 结构化可验证奖励是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Models often struggle with complex, multi-question
reasoning tasks where partial correctness is crucial for effective learning.
Traditional reward mechanisms, which provide a single binary score for an
entire response, are too coarse to guide models through intricate problems with
multiple sub-parts. To address this, we introduce StructVRM, a method that
aligns multimodal reasoning with Structured and Verifiable Reward Models. At
its core is a model-based verifier trained to provide fine-grained,
sub-question-level feedback, assessing semantic and mathematical equivalence
rather than relying on rigid string matching. This allows for nuanced, partial
credit scoring in previously intractable problem formats. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of StructVRM. Our trained model, Seed-StructVRM,
achieves state-of-the-art performance on six out of twelve public multimodal
benchmarks and our newly curated, high-difficulty STEM-Bench. The success of
StructVRM validates that training with structured, verifiable rewards is a
highly effective approach for advancing the capabilities of multimodal models
in complex, real-world reasoning domains.

Motivation: 为智能交通系统提供高效的预测性维护解决方案，以提升铁路运营的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 采用包含样本预处理、增量分类和解释模块的在线处理流程，支持实时故障预测。

Result: 在MetroPT数据集上，F-measure超过98%，准确率达99%，且对类别不平衡和噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在铁路预测性维护中具有实际应用价值，能有效支持主动维护决策。

Abstract: This work contributes to a real-time data-driven predictive maintenance
solution for Intelligent Transportation Systems. The proposed method implements
a processing pipeline comprised of sample pre-processing, incremental
classification with Machine Learning models, and outcome explanation. This
novel online processing pipeline has two main highlights: (i) a dedicated
sample pre-processing module, which builds statistical and frequency-related
features on the fly, and (ii) an explainability module. This work is the first
to perform online fault prediction with natural language and visual
explainability. The experiments were performed with the MetroPT data set from
the metro operator of Porto, Portugal. The results are above 98 % for F-measure
and 99 % for accuracy. In the context of railway predictive maintenance,
achieving these high values is crucial due to the practical and operational
implications of accurate failure prediction. In the specific case of a high
F-measure, this ensures that the system maintains an optimal balance between
detecting the highest possible number of real faults and minimizing false
alarms, which is crucial for maximizing service availability. Furthermore, the
accuracy obtained enables reliability, directly impacting cost reduction and
increased safety. The analysis demonstrates that the pipeline maintains high
performance even in the presence of class imbalance and noise, and its
explanations effectively reflect the decision-making process. These findings
validate the methodological soundness of the approach and confirm its practical
applicability for supporting proactive maintenance decisions in real-world
railway operations. Therefore, by identifying the early signs of failure, this
pipeline enables decision-makers to understand the underlying problems and act
accordingly swiftly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂动态环境中缺乏细节关注和精确动作规划能力，难以满足现实任务需求，需通过模拟环境评估其物理推理能力。

Method: 提出DeepPHY框架，通过多难度物理推理环境和细粒度评估指标，系统评估VLMs的物理理解和推理能力。

Result: 评估发现，即使是先进的VLMs也难以将描述性物理知识转化为精确的预测控制。

Conclusion: DeepPHY为评估VLMs的物理推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual abilities
and impressive visual reasoning, they struggle with attention to detail and
precise action planning in complex, dynamic environments, leading to subpar
performance. Real-world tasks typically require complex interactions, advanced
spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous strategy refinement,
usually necessitating understanding the physics rules of the target scenario.
However, evaluating these capabilities in real-world scenarios is often
prohibitively expensive. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepPHY, a novel
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate VLMs' understanding and
reasoning about fundamental physical principles through a series of challenging
simulated environments. DeepPHY integrates multiple physical reasoning
environments of varying difficulty levels and incorporates fine-grained
evaluation metrics. Our evaluation finds that even state-of-the-art VLMs
struggle to translate descriptive physical knowledge into precise, predictive
control.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are beginning to reshape how chemists plan and
run reactions in organic synthesis. Trained on millions of reported
transformations, these text-based models can propose synthetic routes, forecast
reaction outcomes and even instruct robots that execute experiments without
human supervision. Here we survey the milestones that turned LLMs from
speculative tools into practical lab partners. We show how coupling LLMs with
graph neural networks, quantum calculations and real-time spectroscopy shrinks
discovery cycles and supports greener, data-driven chemistry. We discuss
limitations, including biased datasets, opaque reasoning and the need for
safety gates that prevent unintentional hazards. Finally, we outline community
initiatives open benchmarks, federated learning and explainable interfaces that
aim to democratize access while keeping humans firmly in control. These
advances chart a path towards rapid, reliable and inclusive molecular
innovation powered by artificial intelligence and automation.

Conclusion: 呼吁采用更灵活的对齐策略，以适应不同地域的多样性和复杂性。

Abstract: AI (super) alignment describes the challenge of ensuring (future) AI systems
behave in accordance with societal norms and goals. While a quickly evolving
literature is addressing biases and inequalities, the geographic variability of
alignment remains underexplored. Simply put, what is considered appropriate,
truthful, or legal can differ widely across regions due to cultural norms,
political realities, and legislation. Alignment measures applied to AI/ML
workflows can sometimes produce outcomes that diverge from statistical
realities, such as text-to-image models depicting balanced gender ratios in
company leadership despite existing imbalances. Crucially, some model outputs
are globally acceptable, while others, e.g., questions about Kashmir, depend on
knowing the user's location and their context. This geographic sensitivity is
not new. For instance, Google Maps renders Kashmir's borders differently based
on user location. What is new is the unprecedented scale and automation with
which AI now mediates knowledge, expresses opinions, and represents geographic
reality to millions of users worldwide, often with little transparency about
how context is managed. As we approach Agentic AI, the need for
spatio-temporally aware alignment, rather than one-size-fits-all approaches, is
increasingly urgent. This paper reviews key geographic research problems,
suggests topics for future work, and outlines methods for assessing alignment
sensitivity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究提出Bench-2-CoP框架，量化AI评估基准与欧盟AI法案之间的差距，发现现有基准严重忽视关键功能能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估基准未能覆盖新法规关注的系统性风险，亟需量化这一差距。

Method: 使用LLM-as-judge分析，将194,955个基准问题映射到欧盟AI法案的能力分类。

Result: 基准评估集中于少数行为倾向（如幻觉倾向53.7%），关键功能能力（如失控场景）几乎未被覆盖。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了评估差距，为政策制定者和开发者提供了改进方向，以促进更安全合规的AI。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of General Purpose AI (GPAI) models necessitates robust
evaluation frameworks, especially with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act
and its associated Code of Practice (CoP). Current AI evaluation practices
depend heavily on established benchmarks, but these tools were not designed to
measure the systemic risks that are the focus of the new regulatory landscape.
This research addresses the urgent need to quantify this "benchmark-regulation
gap." We introduce Bench-2-CoP, a novel, systematic framework that uses
validated LLM-as-judge analysis to map the coverage of 194,955 questions from
widely-used benchmarks against the EU AI Act's taxonomy of model capabilities
and propensities. Our findings reveal a profound misalignment: the evaluation
ecosystem is overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of behavioral propensities,
such as "Tendency to hallucinate" (53.7% of the corpus) and "Discriminatory
bias" (28.9%), while critical functional capabilities are dangerously
neglected. Crucially, capabilities central to loss-of-control scenarios,
including evading human oversight, self-replication, and autonomous AI
development, receive zero coverage in the entire benchmark corpus. This
translates to a near-total evaluation gap for systemic risks like "Loss of
Control" (0.4% coverage) and "Cyber Offence" (0.8% coverage). This study
provides the first comprehensive, quantitative analysis of this gap, offering
critical insights for policymakers to refine the CoP and for developers to
build the next generation of evaluation tools, ultimately fostering safer and
more compliant AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用小型高效LLM生成多样化ERC数据集，补充现有基准，提升分类性能和标签平衡分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERC数据稀缺且存在偏见和主观性，LLM虽强但成本高，需低成本解决方案。

Method: 利用小型通用LLM生成六种新数据集，补充三大ERC基准，评估其分类和标签平衡效果。

Result: 生成数据集显著提升ERC分类器的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 小型LLM生成的数据集能有效补充ERC任务，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) focuses on identifying emotion
shifts within interactions, representing a significant step toward advancing
machine intelligence. However, ERC data remains scarce, and existing datasets
face numerous challenges due to their highly biased sources and the inherent
subjectivity of soft labels. Even though Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated their quality in many affective tasks, they are typically
expensive to train, and their application to ERC tasks--particularly in data
generation--remains limited. To address these challenges, we employ a small,
resource-efficient, and general-purpose LLM to synthesize ERC datasets with
diverse properties, supplementing the three most widely used ERC benchmarks. We
generate six novel datasets, with two tailored to enhance each benchmark. We
evaluate the utility of these datasets to (1) supplement existing datasets for
ERC classification, and (2) analyze the effects of label imbalance in ERC. Our
experimental results indicate that ERC classifier models trained on the
generated datasets exhibit strong robustness and consistently achieve
statistically significant performance improvements on existing ERC benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务上表现出色，但后训练增强其能力通常需要大量数据和计算资源，现有方法缺乏可扩展性。

Method: InfiAlign采用多维质量指标自动筛选高质量数据，结合SFT和DPO进行模型对齐。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base模型上，仅用12%的训练数据即达到与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B相当的性能，数学推理任务提升3.89%。

Conclusion: InfiAlign通过高效数据选择和全阶段后训练，为大规模推理模型的对齐提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive reasoning abilities on
a wide range of complex tasks. However, enhancing these capabilities through
post-training remains resource intensive, particularly in terms of data and
computational cost. Although recent efforts have sought to improve sample
efficiency through selective data curation, existing methods often rely on
heuristic or task-specific strategies that hinder scalability. In this work, we
introduce InfiAlign, a scalable and sample-efficient post-training framework
that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs for enhanced reasoning. At the core of
InfiAlign is a robust data selection pipeline that automatically curates
high-quality alignment data from open-source reasoning datasets using
multidimensional quality metrics. This pipeline enables significant performance
gains while drastically reducing data requirements and remains extensible to
new data sources. When applied to the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base model, our SFT model
achieves performance on par with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, while using only
approximately 12% of the training data, and demonstrates strong generalization
across diverse reasoning tasks. Additional improvements are obtained through
the application of DPO, with particularly notable gains in mathematical
reasoning tasks. The model achieves an average improvement of 3.89% on AIME
24/25 benchmarks. Our results highlight the effectiveness of combining
principled data selection with full-stage post-training, offering a practical
solution for aligning large reasoning models in a scalable and data-efficient
manner. The model checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: GRAIL框架通过结合LLM引导的随机探索和路径过滤，解决了现有RAG方法在结构化知识（如知识图谱）处理上的不足，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法主要针对非结构化数据，对结构化知识（如知识图谱）处理能力有限，且当前图谱检索方法难以捕捉整体结构并控制精度。

Method: GRAIL框架整合LLM引导的随机探索与路径过滤，生成细粒度推理轨迹，并通过两阶段训练学习动态决策策略。

Result: 在三个知识图谱问答数据集上，GRAIL平均准确率提升21.01%，F1值提升22.43%。

Conclusion: GRAIL通过交互式检索范式，动态平衡检索广度和精度，显著提升了知识图谱推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) techniques have exhibited remarkable performance across a wide range of
domains. However, existing RAG approaches primarily operate on unstructured
data and demonstrate limited capability in handling structured knowledge such
as knowledge graphs. Meanwhile, current graph retrieval methods fundamentally
struggle to capture holistic graph structures while simultaneously facing
precision control challenges that manifest as either critical information gaps
or excessive redundant connections, collectively undermining reasoning
performance. To address this challenge, we propose GRAIL: Graph-Retrieval
Augmented Interactive Learning, a framework designed to interact with
large-scale graphs for retrieval-augmented reasoning. Specifically, GRAIL
integrates LLM-guided random exploration with path filtering to establish a
data synthesis pipeline, where a fine-grained reasoning trajectory is
automatically generated for each task. Based on the synthesized data, we then
employ a two-stage training process to learn a policy that dynamically decides
the optimal actions at each reasoning step. The overall objective of
precision-conciseness balance in graph retrieval is decoupled into fine-grained
process-supervised rewards to enhance data efficiency and training stability.
In practical deployment, GRAIL adopts an interactive retrieval paradigm,
enabling the model to autonomously explore graph paths while dynamically
balancing retrieval breadth and precision. Extensive experiments have shown
that GRAIL achieves an average accuracy improvement of 21.01% and F1
improvement of 22.43% on three knowledge graph question-answering datasets. Our
source code and datasets is available at https://github.com/Changgeww/GRAIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法（如LLM-as-a-Judge）仅关注最终输出，忽略了逐步推理过程，且现有Agent-as-a-Judge系统局限于特定领域。

Method: 设计了一个模块化框架，将任务分解为子任务，验证每一步，并聚合模块输出以生成最终评估结果。

Result: 在GAIA和BigCodeBench基准测试中，提出的Judge Agent比GPT-4o基线方法分别提高了4.76%和10.52%的评估准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了通用评估方法的潜力，能够更准确地模拟人类评估过程。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of foundation models as agents across diverse domains
necessitates a robust evaluation framework. Current methods, such as
LLM-as-a-Judge, focus only on final outputs, overlooking the step-by-step
reasoning that drives agentic decision-making. Meanwhile, existing
Agent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,
are typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this
gap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task
completion independent of the task domain. The framework emulates human-like
evaluation by decomposing tasks into sub-tasks and validating each step using
available information, such as the agent's output and reasoning. Each module
contributes to a specific aspect of the evaluation process, and their outputs
are aggregated to produce a final verdict on task completion. We validate our
framework by evaluating the Magentic-One Actor Agent on two benchmarks, GAIA
and BigCodeBench. Our Judge Agent predicts task success with closer agreement
to human evaluations, achieving 4.76% and 10.52% higher alignment accuracy,
respectively, compared to the GPT-4o based LLM-as-a-Judge baseline. This
demonstrates the potential of our proposed general-purpose evaluation
framework.

Insights, a novel AI-based detection tool for assessing leadership skills in
LORs submitted by online master's program applicants. By employing natural

TL;DR: MV-Debate是一种多视角代理辩论框架，用于统一多模态有害内容检测，通过动态反射门控提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中多模态内容的复杂性使得有害意图（如讽刺、仇恨言论）难以识别，需解决跨模态矛盾和文化快速变化等问题。

Method: MV-Debate结合四种互补代理（表面分析、深度推理、模态对比和社会情境分析），通过迭代辩论和反射门控优化结果。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MV-Debate显著优于单模型和现有多代理辩论基线。

Conclusion: 多代理辩论框架在安全关键在线环境中具有潜力，可提升社会意图检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Social media has evolved into a complex multimodal environment where text,
images, and other signals interact to shape nuanced meanings, often concealing
harmful intent. Identifying such intent, whether sarcasm, hate speech, or
misinformation, remains challenging due to cross-modal contradictions, rapid
cultural shifts, and subtle pragmatic cues. To address these challenges, we
propose MV-Debate, a multi-view agent debate framework with dynamic reflection
gating for unified multimodal harmful content detection. MV-Debate assembles
four complementary debate agents, a surface analyst, a deep reasoner, a
modality contrast, and a social contextualist, to analyze content from diverse
interpretive perspectives. Through iterative debate and reflection, the agents
refine responses under a reflection-gain criterion, ensuring both accuracy and
efficiency. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MV-Debate
significantly outperforms strong single-model and existing multi-agent debate
baselines. This work highlights the promise of multi-agent debate in advancing
reliable social intent detection in safety-critical online contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统依赖高质量训练数据和人工奖励设计，面临可扩展性挑战，阻碍了真正自主智能的发展。

Method: 提出将主动推理（AIF）作为替代外部奖励信号的方法，结合大语言模型生成世界模型，实现自主学习和目标适应。

Result: AIF能够通过内在驱动平衡探索与利用，结合大语言模型，提升AI系统从经验中学习的能力。

Conclusion: AIF为解决自主AI代理的"接地代理鸿沟"提供了可行路径，推动AI系统在计算和物理约束下的自主发展。

Abstract: This paper argues that Active Inference (AIF) provides a crucial foundation
for developing autonomous AI agents capable of learning from experience without
continuous human reward engineering. As AI systems begin to exhaust
high-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for
reward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges
that could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The
proposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated
data, is a promising step forward. However, this vision still depends on
extensive human engineering of reward functions, effectively shifting the
bottleneck from data curation to reward curation. This highlights what we
identify as the \textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI
systems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to
changing circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing
external reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,
allowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a
unified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative
world models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create
agents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with
human values. This synthesis offers a compelling path toward AI systems that
can develop autonomously while adhering to both computational and physical
constraints.

Abstract: Capturing human learning behavior based on deep learning methods has become a
major research focus in both psychology and intelligent systems. Recent
approaches rely on controlled experiments or rule-based models to explore
cognitive processes. However, they struggle to capture learning dynamics, track
progress over time, or provide explainability. To address these challenges, we
introduce LearnerAgent, a novel multi-agent framework based on Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate a realistic teaching environment. To explore
human-like learning dynamics, we construct learners with psychologically
grounded profiles-such as Deep, Surface, and Lazy-as well as a persona-free
General Learner to inspect the base LLM's default behavior. Through weekly
knowledge acquisition, monthly strategic choices, periodic tests, and peer
interaction, we can track the dynamic learning progress of individual learners
over a full-year journey. Our findings are fourfold: 1) Longitudinal analysis
reveals that only Deep Learner achieves sustained cognitive growth. Our
specially designed "trap questions" effectively diagnose Surface Learner's
shallow knowledge. 2) The behavioral and cognitive patterns of distinct
learners align closely with their psychological profiles. 3) Learners'
self-concept scores evolve realistically, with the General Learner developing
surprisingly high self-efficacy despite its cognitive limitations. 4)
Critically, the default profile of base LLM is a "diligent but brittle Surface
Learner"-an agent that mimics the behaviors of a good student but lacks true,
generalizable understanding. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that
LearnerAgent aligns well with real scenarios, yielding more insightful findings
about LLMs' behavior.

Result: 转移初始浓度较高的分子能提升性能，减少每次转移的分子数量可进一步提高效率。

Conclusion: 通过能量高效的分子转移技术优化分子通信系统性能。

Abstract: Information molecules play a crucial role in molecular communication (MC),
acting as carriers for information transfer. A common approach to get
information molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;
however, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental
molecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are
identical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as
molecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that
harvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two
reservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer
them between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores
energy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through
theoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for
moving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring
higher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while
using fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency. These findings
provide valuable insights for optimizing MC systems through energy-efficient
molecule transfer techniques.

Abstract: This paper investigates the energy efficiency optimization for movable
antenna (MA) systems by considering the time delay and energy consumption
introduced by MA movement. We first derive the upper bound on energy efficiency
for a single-user downlink communication system, where the user is equipped
with a single MA. Then, the energy efficiency maximization problem is
formulated to optimize the MA position, and an efficient algorithm based on
successive convex approximation is proposed to solve this non-convex
optimization problem. Simulation results show that, despite the overhead caused
by MA movement, the MA system can still improve the energy efficiency compared
to the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) system.

Motivation: 现有的G-JSD在机器学习中因其高斯分布的闭式解而流行，但需要归一化几何混合，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出扩展的G-JSD，适用于更一般的正测度，并给出其与G-JSD的差距及上下界。

Result: 推导了多元高斯分布下的闭式解，并表明扩展G-JSD和G-JSD可视为普通JSD的正则化形式。

Conclusion: 扩展G-JSD为更广泛的正测度提供了理论支持，并在高斯分布下具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine
learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between
Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of
the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which
does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the
extended G-JSD as it extends to more general positive measures. We give
explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and G-JSD when considering
probability densities, and report both lower and upper bounds in terms of other
statistical divergences. We derive corresponding closed-form expressions when
considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in
applications. Finally, we show that these two types of geometric JSDs, the
G-JSD and the extended G-JSD, can be interpreted as regularizations of the
ordinary JSD by additive terms.

Conclusion: 只有基于对称平衡不完全区组设计的协议才能同时实现最优误差和最优通信。

Abstract: Local differential privacy represents the gold standard for preserving the
privacy of data before it leaves the device, and distribution estimation under
this model has been well studied. Recently, protocols built upon balanced
incomplete block designs were shown to achieve optimal error for this problem.
However, it remained unknown whether other constructions could also be optimal.
We resolve this question by proving that any protocol achieving optimal error
must correspond to some balanced incomplete block design. This result, combined
with prior work, completely characterises the set of optimal protocols for this
problem. As a consequence, the protocols that achieve optimal error and optimal
communication are only those based on symmetrical balanced incomplete block
designs.

Abstract: Underestimating the leakage can compromise secrecy, while overestimating it
may lead to inefficient system design. Therefore, a reliable leakage estimator
is essential. Neural network-based estimators provide a data-driven way to
estimate mutual information without requiring full knowledge of the channel or
source distributions. In this work, we aim to scale the blocklength of a
wiretap code such that the estimator can still feasibly operate. We propose an
improved mutual information estimator based on the variational contrastive
log-ration upper bound framework, tailored for both discrete and continuous
variables. By using a mixture of Bernoulli experts parameterized by neural
networks, the estimator is able to quantify information leakage in
communication systems, which employ complex data processing like universal hash
family. We further propose a method to utilize the proposed estimator to design
the universal hash family for a wiretap code or secret key generation design.
Simulation results show thatprior methods significantly underestimate the
mutual information, particularly when using universal hash family for higher
blocklengths ($n\gg$16). The proposed method can scale the blocklength up to
255, and we conjecture that the design can scale well to even higher
blocklengths given adequate training data and model size. Additionally, we
contend that our proposed estimator and adaptive hash design framework offer a
practical approach for extending physical layer security considerations for
wiretap channels into the finite blocklength regime.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the work of Abbondati et al. (2024) on decoding
simultaneous rational function codes by addressing two important scenarios:
multiplicities and poles (zeros of denominators). First, we generalize previous
results to rational codes with multiplicities by considering evaluations with
multi-precision. Then, using the hybrid model from Guerrini et al. (2023), we
extend our approach to vectors of rational functions that may present poles.
Our contributions include: a rigorous analysis of the decoding algorithm's
failure probability that generalizes and improves several previous results, an
extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be
assumed random, and a new improved analysis in the more general context
handling poles within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a
comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more
complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for
rational function codes.

Conclusion: 动态夹持波束成形能显著提升总容量，数值结果验证了理论发现。

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASSs) have recently shown their promising ability
to flexibly reconfigure wireless channels via dynamically adjusting the
positions of pinching antennas over a dielectric waveguide, termed as pinching
beamforming. This paper studies the fundamental limit of the sum capacity for a
PASSassisted multiple access channel, in which multiple users transmit
individual messages to a BS under the average power constraint. To this end, we
consider a dynamic pinching beamforming setup, where multiple pinching
beamforming vectors are employed in a transmission period and the
capacity-achieving non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based transmission
scheme is considered. For the ideal case with an asymptotically large number of
pinching beamforming vectors, we unveil that the optimal transmission scheme is
alternating transmission among each user with its channel power gain maximized
by dynamic pinching beamforming, which implies that the NOMA-based transmission
scheme is not needed. The corresponding sum-rate is derived in closed-form
expression, which serves as the upper bound of the sum-capacity. Inspired by
this result, a lower bound of the sum-rate under an arbitrarily finite number
of pinching beamforming vectors is obtained. Numerical results validate our
theoretical findings and illustrate the practical significance of using dynamic
pinching beamforming to improve the sum capacity.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure and properties of additive
complementary dual (ACD) codes over the mixed alphabet
$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$ relative to a certain inner product defined over
$\mathbb{F}_2\mathbb{F}_4$. We establish sufficient conditions under which such

complementary dual codes as their images under the linear map $W$. Notably, we
prove that if the binary image of a code is LCD, then the original code is
necessarily ACD. An example is given where the image is a distance-optimal
binary LCD code.

Motivation: 研究独立同分布离散随机变量和的熵的渐近行为，特别是通过引入不相称秩来量化熵的下界。

Method: 基于已知的多项式分布和格点随机变量和的熵的渐近表达式，推导出一般情况下的熵下界。

Result: 得到了熵的渐近下界表达式：$H \geq \frac{r(X)}{2}\log(N) + {\it cst}$，其中$r(X)$为不相称秩。

Conclusion: 通过不相称秩，论文为独立同分布离散随机变量和的熵提供了新的渐近下界，扩展了现有结果。

Abstract: We derive an asymptotic lower bound on the Shannon entropy $H$ of sums of $N$
arbitrary iid discrete random variables. The derived bound $H \geq
\frac{r(X)}{2}\log(N) + {\it cst}$ is given in terms of the incommensurability
rank $r(X)$ of the random variable -- a positive integer quantity that we
introduce. The derivation does not rely on central limit theorems, but builds
upon the known expressions of the asymptotic entropy of the multinomial
distribution and sums of iid lattice random variables, which correspond to the
case $r(X)=1$.

Result: 提出的方案显著减少了reducer节点数量，但通信成本有所增加。

Conclusion: MADC模型通过组合设计提供了一种灵活的分布式计算框架，平衡了节点数量和通信开销。

Abstract: This paper explores the multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model, a
novel distributed computing framework where mapper and reducer nodes are
distinct entities. Unlike traditional MapReduce frameworks, MADC leverages
coding-theoretic techniques to minimize communication overhead without
necessitating file replication across mapper nodes. We introduce a new approach
utilizing combinatorial designs, specifically t-designs, to construct efficient
coding schemes that achieve a computation load of 1. By establishing a
connection between t-designs and MapReduce Arrays, we characterize the
achievable communication loads and demonstrate the flexibility of our method in
selecting the number of reducer nodes. The proposed scheme significantly
reduces the number of reducer nodes relative to existing combinatorial topology
schemes, at the expense of increased communication cost.

TL;DR: 长极化码在有限迭代次数下优于LDPC码，尤其是在简化连续消除解码（SSC）下，复杂度更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即极化码在长码长下不如LDPC码，实际应用中迭代次数受限。

Method: 比较极化码（SC和SSC解码）与LDPC码（BP解码）在固定点LLR操作下的性能。

Result: 长极化码在相同操作次数下优于LDPC码，SSC解码复杂度低于N logN。

Conclusion: 极化码在长码长和有限迭代下具有优势，SSC解码效率更高。

Abstract: The prevailing opinion in industry and academia is that polar codes are
competitive for short code lengths, but can no longer keep up with low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes as block length increases. This view is typically
based on the assumption that LDPC codes can be decoded with a large number of
belief propagation (BP) iterations. However, in practice, the number of
iterations may be rather limited due to latency and complexity constraints. In
this paper, we show that for a similar number of fixed-point log-likelihood
ratio (LLR) operations, long polar codes under successive cancellation (SC)
decoding outperform their LDPC counterparts. In particular, simplified
successive cancellation (SSC) decoding of polar codes exhibits a better
complexity scaling than $N \log{N}$ and requires fewer operations than a single
BP iteration of an LDPC code with the same parameters.

Result: 两源PID问题得到解决，多源PID存在根本性不一致；新方法在Ising模型实验中表现良好。

Conclusion: 需要新的框架来研究多元信息分解，当前PID方法在多源情况下存在局限性。

Abstract: While mutual information effectively quantifies dependence between two
variables, it cannot capture complex, fine-grained interactions that emerge in
multivariate systems.The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework was
introduced to address this by decomposing the mutual information between a set
of source variables and a target variable into fine-grained information atoms
such as redundant, unique, and synergistic components. In this work, we review
the axiomatic system and desired properties of the PID framework and make three
main contributions. First, we resolve the two-source PID case by providing
explicit closed-form formulas for all information atoms that satisfy the full
set of axioms and desirable properties. Second, we prove that for three or more
sources, PID suffers from fundamental inconsistencies: we present a
three-variable counterexample where the sum of atoms exceeds the total
information, and prove an impossibility theorem showing that no lattice-based
decomposition can be consistent for all subsets when the number of sources
exceeds three. Finally, we deviate from the PID lattice approach to avoid its
inconsistencies, and present explicit measures of multivariate unique and
synergistic information. Our proposed measures, which rely on new systems of
random variables that eliminate higher-order dependencies, satisfy key axioms
such as additivity and continuity, provide a robust theoretical explanation of
high-order relations, and show strong numerical performance in comprehensive
experiments on the Ising model. Our findings highlight the need for a new
framework for studying multivariate information decomposition.

Abstract: This paper investigates an autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled integrated
sensing, communication, and computation system, with a particular focus on
integrating movable antennas (MAs) into the system for enhancing overall system
performance. Specifically, multiple MA-enabled AVVs perform sensing tasks and
simultaneously transmit the generated computational tasks to the base station
for processing. To minimize the maximum latency under the sensing and resource
constraints, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly coordinates the
position of the MAs, the computation resource allocation, and the transmit
beamforming. Due to the non-convexity of the objective function and strong
coupling among variables, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm leveraging
particle swarm optimization and convex optimization to address it. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant
latency improvements compared to the baseline schemes.

Method: 结合预测向量和真实估值设计算法，分析预测误差对EFX分配的影响。

Result: 证明近似EFX分配在预测辅助下仍具挑战性，但提出了一种针对两代理的算法。

Conclusion: 预测辅助可部分改善EFX分配，但需高精度预测支持。

Abstract: We study an online fair division problem where a fixed number of goods arrive
sequentially and must be allocated to a given set of agents. Once a good
arrives, its true value for each agent is revealed, and it has to be
immediately and irrevocably allocated to some agent. The ultimate goal is to
ensure envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) after all goods have been allocated.
Unfortunately, as we show, approximate EFX allocations are unattainable in
general, even under restrictive assumptions on the valuation functions.
  To address this, we follow a recent and fruitful trend of augmenting
algorithms with predictions. Specifically, we assume access to a prediction
vector estimating the agents' true valuations -- e.g., generated by a machine
learning model trained on past data. Predictions may be unreliable, and we
measure their error using the total variation distance from the true
valuations, that is, the percentage of predicted value-mass that disagrees with
the true values.
  Focusing on the natural class of additive valuations, we prove impossibility
results even on approximate EFX allocations for algorithms that either ignore
predictions or rely solely on them. We then turn to algorithms that use both
the predictions and the true values and show strong lower bounds on the
prediction accuracy that is required by any algorithm to compute an approximate
EFX. These negative results persist even under identical valuations, contrary
to the offline setting where exact EFX allocations always exist without the
necessity of predictions. We then present an algorithm for two agents with
identical valuations that uses effectively the predictions and the true values.
The algorithm approximates EFX, with its guarantees improving as the accuracy
of the predictions increases.

Abstract: Wireless networks are evolving from radio resource providers to complex
systems that also involve computing, with the latter being distributed across
edge and cloud facilities. Also, their optimization is shifting more and more
from a performance to a value-oriented paradigm. The two aspects shall be
balanced continuously, to maximize the utilities of Services Providers (SPs),
users quality of experience and fairness, while meeting global constraints in
terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint among others, with all these
heterogeneous resources contributing. In this paper, we tackle the problem of
communication and compute resource allocation under energy constraints, with
multiple SPs competing to get their preferred resource bundle by spending a a
fictitious currency budget. By modeling the network as a Fisher market, we
propose a low complexity solution able to achieve high utilities and guarantee
energy constraints, while also promoting fairness among SPs, as compared to a
social optimal solution. The market equilibrium is proved mathematically, and
numerical results show the multi-dimensional trade-off between utility and
energy at different locations, with communication and computation-intensive
services.

Abstract: This article presents a new three-player version of the bridge playing card
game for the purpose of ending fixed partnerships so that the play can be more
dynamic and flexible. By dynamically redefining team makeup in real time, this
game design increases unpredictability and forces players to repeatedly update
strategy. A novel scoring system is introduced to reduce biases present in
conventional rule-based games by favoring fairness via reward systems that
enforce tactical decision making and risk assessment. Being subject to regular
bridge rules, this version tests players to collaborate without fixed
friendships, requiring fluid adjustment and adaptive bidding behavior in real
time. Strategic issues involve aggressive and defensive bidding, adaptable
playing styles, and loss-seeking strategies specific to the three-player
structure. The article discusses probabilistic issues of bidding, trump and
no-trump declarative effects, and algorithmic methods to trick-taking.
Simulation outcomes illustrate the efficiency of diverse strategies. The game's
architecture is ideal for competitions and possibly influential in broadening
entry pools for tournament card games.
