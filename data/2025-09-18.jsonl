We study the complexity of calculating the Shapley value of a tuple for\nan aggregate conjunctive query, which applies an aggregation function to the\nresult of a conjunctive query (CQ) based on a value function that assigns a\nnumber to each query answer. Prior work by Livshits, Bertossi, Kimelfeld, and\nSebag (2020) established that this task is #P-hard for every nontrivial\naggregation function when the query is non-hierarchical with respect to its\nexistential variables, assuming the absence of self-joins. They further showed\nthat this condition precisely characterizes the class of intractable CQs when\nthe aggregate function is sum or count. In addition, they posed as open\nproblems the complexity of other common aggregate functions such as min, max,\ncount-distinct, average, and quantile (including median). Towards the\nresolution of these problems, we identify for each aggregate function a class\nof hierarchical CQs where the Shapley value is tractable with every value\nfunction, as long as it is local (i.e., determined by the tuples of one\nrelation). We further show that each such class is maximal: for every CQ\noutside of this class, there is a local (easy-to-compute) value function that\nmakes the Shapley value #P-hard. Interestingly, our results reveal that each\naggregate function corresponds to a different generalization of the class of\nhierarchical CQs from Boolean to non-Boolean queries. In particular, max, min,\nand count-distinct match the class of CQs that are all-hierarchical (i.e.,\nhierarchical with respect to all variables), and average and quantile match the\nnarrower class of q-hierarchical CQs introduced by Berkholz, Keppeler, and\nSchweikardt (2017) in the context of the fine-grained complexity of query\nanswering."}

FL, WPT, multi-antenna AP, and RIS\ncan mitigate these challenges by reducing the need for large data\ntransmissions, enabling sustainable energy harvesting, and optimizing the\npropagation environment. Compared to conventional RIS, STAR-RIS not only\nextends coverage from half-space to full-space but also improves energy saving\nthrough appropriate mode selection. Motivated by the need for sustainable,\nlow-latency, and energy-efficient communication in large-scale IoT networks,\nthis paper investigates the efficient STAR-RIS mode in the uplink and downlink\nphases of a WPT-FL multi-antenna AP network with non-orthogonal multiple access\nto minimize energy consumption, a joint optimization that remains largely\nunexplored in existing works on RIS or STAR-RIS. We formulate a non-convex\nenergy minimization problem for different STAR-RIS modes, i.e., energy\nsplitting (ES) and time switching (TS), in both uplink and downlink\ntransmission phases, where STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, beamforming matrices,\ntime and power for harvesting, uplink transmission, and downlink transmission,\nlocal processing time, and computation frequency for each user are jointly\noptimized. To tackle the non-convexity, the problem is decoupled into two\nsubproblems: the first subproblem optimizes STAR-RIS phase shift vectors and\nbeamforming matrices across all WPT-FL phases using block coordinate descent\nover either semi-definite programming or Rayleigh quotient problems, while the\nsecond one allocates time, power, and computation frequency via the\none-dimensional search algorithms or the bisection algorithm."}

With MIRA, users can long-press on images or text objects to\nreceive contextually relevant instruction recommendations for executing AI\ntasks. Our work introduces three key innovations: 1) A multimodal large\nlanguage model (MLLM)-based recommendation pipeline with structured reasoning\nto extract key entities, infer user intent, and generate precise instructions;\n2) A template-augmented reasoning mechanism that integrates high-level\nreasoning templates, enhancing task inference accuracy; 3) A prefix-tree-based\nconstrained decoding strategy that restricts outputs to predefined instruction\ncandidates, ensuring coherent and intent-aligned suggestions. Through\nevaluation using a real-world annotated datasets and a user study, MIRA has\ndemonstrated substantial improvements in the accuracy of instruction\nrecommendation. The encouraging results highlight MIRA's potential to\nrevolutionize the way users engage with AI services on their smartphones,\noffering a more seamless and efficient experience."}

We address this by reframing jamming mitigation\nas dynamic graph regression and introducing a receiver-centric deep temporal\ngraph network that predicts, and thus corrects, the receivers horizontal\ndeviation in real time. At each 1 Hz epoch, the satellite receiver environment\nis represented as a heterogeneous star graph (receiver center, tracked\nsatellites as leaves) with time varying attributes (e.g., SNR, azimuth,\nelevation, latitude/longitude). A single layer Heterogeneous Graph ConvLSTM\n(HeteroGCLSTM) aggregates one hop spatial context and temporal dynamics over a\nshort history to output the 2D deviation vector applied for on the fly\ncorrection.\n  We evaluate on datasets from two distinct receivers under three jammer\nprofiles, continuous wave (cw), triple tone (cw3), and wideband FM, each\nexercised at six power levels between -45 and -70 dBm, with 50 repetitions per\nscenario (prejam/jam/recovery). Against strong multivariate time series\nbaselines (MLP, uniform CNN, and Seq2Point CNN), our model consistently attains\nthe lowest mean absolute error (MAE). At -45 dBm, it achieves 3.64 cm\n(GP01/cw), 7.74 cm (GP01/cw3), 4.41 cm (ublox/cw), 4.84 cm (ublox/cw3), and\n4.82 cm (ublox/FM), improving to 1.65-2.08 cm by -60 to -70 dBm. On mixed mode\ndatasets pooling all powers, MAE is 3.78 cm (GP01) and 4.25 cm (ublox10),\noutperforming Seq2Point, MLP, and CNN.

Unlike Euclidean-based\nHilbert-space methods, this approach embraces general Banach spaces. This work\nintroduces a pioneering Banach--Bregman framework for stochastic iterations,\nestablishing Bregman geometry as a foundation for next-generation optimization.\nIt (i) provides a unified template via Bregman projections and Bregman--Fejer\nmonotonicity, encompassing stochastic approximation, mirror descent, natural\ngradient, adaptive methods, and mirror-prox; (ii) establishes super-relaxations\n($\\lambda > 2$) in non-Hilbert settings, enabling flexible geometries and\nelucidating their acceleration effect; and (iii) delivers convergence theorems\nspanning almost-sure boundedness to geometric rates, validated on synthetic and\nreal-world tasks. Empirical studies across machine learning (UCI benchmarks),\ndeep learning (e.g., Transformer training), reinforcement learning\n(actor--critic), and large language models (WikiText-2 with distilGPT-2) show\nup to 20% faster convergence, reduced variance, and enhanced accuracy over\nclassical baselines. These results position Banach--Bregman geometry as a\ncornerstone unifying optimization theory and practice across core AI paradigms."}

To address these critical\nshortcomings, we introduce NIRVANA, a novel pruning method explicitly designed\nto balance immediate zero-shot accuracy preservation with robust fine-tuning\ncapability. Leveraging a first-order saliency criterion derived from the Neural\nTangent Kernel under Adam optimization dynamics, NIRVANA provides a\ntheoretically grounded pruning strategy that respects essential model training\nbehaviors. To further address the unique challenges posed by structured\npruning, NIRVANA incorporates an adaptive sparsity allocation mechanism across\nlayers and modules (attention vs. MLP), which adjusts pruning intensity between\nmodules in a globally balanced manner. Additionally, to mitigate the high\nsensitivity of pruning decisions to calibration data quality, we propose a\nsimple yet effective KL divergence-based calibration data selection strategy,\nensuring more reliable and task-agnostic pruning outcomes. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on Llama3, Qwen, and T5 models demonstrate that NIRVANA\noutperforms existing structured pruning methods under equivalent sparsity\nconstraints, providing a theoretically sound and practical approach to LLM\ncompression.

Concretely, the current\npolicy produces a group of rollouts; a frozen anchor (the initial policy)\nreconciles omissions and contradictions to estimate a reference, turning extra\ninference-time compute into a teacher signal.

Unlike selection methods (best-of-N, majority, perplexity, or judge\nscores), synthesis may disagree with the majority and be correct even when all\nrollouts are wrong; performance scales with the number of rollouts. As a\ntest-time procedure, CaT improves Gemma 3 4B, Qwen 3 4B, and Llama 3.1 8B (up\nto +27% on MATH-500; +12% on HealthBench).
