A common approach to get\ninformation molecules in MC involves harvesting them from the environment;\nhowever, the harvested molecules are often a mixture of various environmental\nmolecules, and the initial concentration ratios in the reservoirs are\nidentical, which hampers high-fidelity transmission techniques such as\nmolecular shift keying (MoSK). This paper presents a transmitter design that\nharvests molecules from the surrounding environment and stores them in two\nreservoirs. To separate the mixed molecules, energy is consumed to transfer\nthem between reservoirs. Given limited energy resources, this work explores\nenergy-efficient strategies to optimize transmitter performance. Through\ntheoretical analysis and simulations, we investigate different methods for\nmoving molecules between reservoirs. The results demonstrate that transferring\nhigher initial concentration molecules enhances transmitter performance, while\nusing fewer molecules per transfer further improves efficiency.

To address\nthis, we introduce NAEx, a plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework that\nexplains alignment models by identifying key subgraphs and features influencing\npredictions. NAEx addresses the key challenge of preserving the joint\ncross-network dependencies on alignment decisions by: (1) jointly\nparameterizing graph structures and feature spaces through learnable edge and\nfeature masks, and (2) introducing an optimization objective that ensures\nexplanations are both faithful to the original predictions and enable\nmeaningful comparisons of structural and feature-based similarities between\nnetworks.

Yet, the central element guiding this process\n-- the prompt -- remains a brittle, opaque string, disconnected from the\nsurrounding dataflow. This disconnect limits reuse, optimization, and runtime\ncontrol.\n  In this paper, we describe our vision and an initial design for SPEAR, a\nlanguage and runtime that fills this prompt management gap by making prompts\nstructured, adaptive, and first-class components of the execution model. SPEAR\nenables (1) runtime prompt refinement -- modifying prompts dynamically in\nresponse to execution-time signals such as confidence, latency, or missing\ncontext; and (2) structured prompt management -- organizing prompt fragments\ninto versioned views with support for introspection and logging.\n  SPEAR defines a prompt algebra that governs how prompts are constructed and\nadapted within a pipeline. It supports multiple refinement modes (manual,\nassisted, and automatic), giving developers a balance between control and\nautomation. By treating prompt logic as structured data, SPEAR enables\noptimizations such as operator fusion, prefix caching, and view reuse.\nPreliminary experiments quantify the behavior of different refinement modes\ncompared to static prompts and agentic retries, as well as the impact of\nprompt-level optimizations such as operator fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPEAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u516c\u6c11\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u5143\u7d20\u4ecd\u662f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u8131\u8282\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u7528\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "SPEAR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\uff08\u7248\u672c\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u3001\u65e5\u5fd7\u652f\u6301\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u91cd\u8bd5\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5982\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u878d\u5408\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SPEAR\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u529b\u3002"}}

FSL is particularly crucial in biomedical, environmental,\nmaterials, and mechanical sciences, where samples are limited and data\ncollection is often prohibitively costly, time-consuming, or ethically\nconstrained. In this study, we present an innovative approach to FSL by\ndemonstrating that a Large Multi-Modal Model (LMMM), trained on a set of\nindependent tasks spanning diverse domains, task types, and input modalities,\ncan substantially improve the generalization of FSL models, outperforming\nmodels based on conventional meta-learning on tasks of the same type. To\nsupport this, we first constructed a Multi-Modal Model Few-shot Dataset (M3FD,\nover 10K+ few-shot samples), which includes 2D RGB images, 2D/3D medical scans,\ntabular and time-course datasets, from which we manually curated FSL tasks such\nas classification. We further introduced M3F (Multi-Modal Model for Few-shot\nlearning framework), a novel Large Multi-Modal Model framework tailored for\ndata-constrained scientific applications. M3F supports a wide range of\nscientific data types through a modular pipeline. By fine-tuning the model on\nM3FD, M3F improves model performance, making LMMM feasible for real-world FSL\ndeployment.

However, most existing benchmarks evaluate large-language-model\nreasoning under idealized settings, overlooking performance in realistic,\nnon-ideal scenarios. We identify three representative non-ideal scenarios with\npractical relevance: summary inference, fine-grained noise suppression, and\ncontextual filtering. We introduce a new research direction guided by\nbrain-science findings that human reasoning remains reliable under imperfect\ninputs. We formally define and evaluate these challenging scenarios. We\nfine-tune three LLMs and a state-of-the-art large vision-language model (LVLM)\nusing RL with a representative policy-gradient algorithm and then test their\nperformance on eight public datasets. Our results reveal that while RL\nfine-tuning improves baseline reasoning under idealized settings, performance\ndeclines significantly across all three non-ideal scenarios, exposing critical\nlimitations in advanced reasoning capabilities. Although we propose a\nscenario-specific remediation method, our results suggest current methods leave\nthese reasoning deficits largely unresolved.

While\nrecent methods leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated paper\nevaluation have shown great promise, they are often constrained by outdated\ndomain knowledge and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we present\nPaperEval, a novel LLM-based framework for automated paper evaluation that\naddresses these limitations through two key components: 1) a domain-aware paper\nretrieval module that retrieves relevant concurrent work to support\ncontextualized assessments of novelty and contributions, and 2) a latent\nreasoning mechanism that enables deep understanding of complex motivations and\nmethodologies, along with comprehensive comparison against concurrently related\nwork, to support more accurate and reliable evaluation.

We introduce AttriLens-Mol,\nan attribute-guided reinforcement learning framework for molecular property\nprediction with LLMs. AttriLens-Mol steers the model's reasoning by using: (1)\na format reward encouraging attribute-based structured output, (2) a count\nreward to avoid enumerating irrelevant attributes, and (3) a rationality reward\nusing advanced LLMs and RDKit to verify the relatedness of the generated\nattributes.

To address this issue, we propose a novel game-theoretic\nframework that models the protein-ligand interaction as a two-player game\ncalled the Docking Game, with the ligand docking module acting as the ligand\nplayer and the protein pocket docking module as the protein player. To solve\nthis game, we develop a novel Loop Self-Play (LoopPlay) algorithm, which\nalternately trains these players through a two-level loop. In the outer loop,\nthe players exchange predicted poses, allowing each to incorporate the other's\nstructural predictions, which fosters mutual adaptation over multiple\niterations.

Recent advancements in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) suggest a complementary approach, where implicit prior\nknowledge and clinical heuristics are naturally embedded through linguistic\nprompts without requiring environment-specific training. In this study, we\nrigorously evaluate open-source LLMs as dynamic insulin dosing agents in an in\nsilico Type 1 diabetes simulator, comparing their zero-shot inference\nperformance against small neural network-based RL agents (SRAs) explicitly\ntrained for the task. Our results indicate that carefully designed zero-shot\nprompts enable smaller LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B) to achieve comparable or\nsuperior clinical performance relative to extensively trained SRAs,\nparticularly in stable patient cohorts.

However, research progress in academia has been hindered by the\nlack of publicly available datasets that accurately reflect the dynamic nature\nof live streaming environments. To address this gap, we introduce KuaiLive, the\nfirst real-time, interactive dataset collected from Kuaishou, a leading live\nstreaming platform in China with over 400 million daily active users. The\ndataset records the interaction logs of 23,772 users and 452,621 streamers over\na 21-day period.

These features enable\nmore realistic simulation of dynamic candidate items and better modeling of\nuser and streamer behaviors. We conduct a thorough analysis of KuaiLive from\nmultiple perspectives and evaluate several representative recommendation\nmethods on it, establishing a strong benchmark for future research.

To address this gap, we introduce\nRetrieval-Augmented Forecasting (RAF) into the hydrology domain, proposing a\nframework that retrieves historically analogous multivariate hydrological\nepisodes to enrich the model input before forecasting. By maintaining an\nexternal archive of past observations, RAF identifies and incorporates relevant\npatterns from historical data, thereby enhancing contextual awareness and\npredictive accuracy without requiring the model for task-specific retraining or\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, we explore and compare both similarity-based and\nmutual information-based RAF methods.

We present a comprehensive theoretical and\nempirical analysis of replicability in transfer learning, introducing a\nmathematical framework that quantifies the fundamental trade-off between\nadaptation effectiveness and result consistency. Our key contribution is the\nformalization of selection sensitivity ($\\Delta_Q$), a measure that captures\nhow adaptive selection strategies respond to perturbations in training data. We\nprove that replicability failure probability: the likelihood that two\nindependent training runs produce models differing in performance by more than\na threshold, increases quadratically with selection sensitivity while\ndecreasing exponentially with sample size. Through extensive experiments on the\nMultiNLI corpus using six adaptive selection strategies - ranging from uniform\nsampling to gradient-based selection - we demonstrate that this theoretical\nrelationship holds precisely in practice.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called\nSelf-Error Adjustment (SEA), which decomposes ensemble errors into two distinct\ncomponents: individual performance terms, representing the self-error of each\nbase learner, and diversity terms, reflecting interactions among learners.

Meanwhile, existing\nAgent-as-a-Judge systems, where one agent evaluates another's task completion,\nare typically designed for narrow, domain-specific settings. To address this\ngap, we propose a generalizable, modular framework for evaluating agent task\ncompletion independent of the task domain.

As AI systems begin to exhaust\nhigh-quality training data and rely on increasingly large human workforces for\nreward design, the current paradigm faces significant scalability challenges\nthat could impede progress toward genuinely autonomous intelligence. The\nproposal for an ``Era of Experience,'' where agents learn from self-generated\ndata, is a promising step forward.

This highlights what we\nidentify as the \\textbf{grounded-agency gap}: the inability of contemporary AI\nsystems to autonomously formulate, adapt, and pursue objectives in response to\nchanging circumstances. We propose that AIF can bridge this gap by replacing\nexternal reward signals with an intrinsic drive to minimize free energy,\nallowing agents to naturally balance exploration and exploitation through a\nunified Bayesian objective. By integrating Large Language Models as generative\nworld models with AIF's principled decision-making framework, we can create\nagents that learn efficiently from experience while remaining aligned with\nhuman values.

Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on\nprogressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which\ncan be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger\ndataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively. Specifically, our \\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster\n(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and\npredicts enhanced weights with improved generalization. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse datasets and architectures demonstrate that KNOW prediction\nconsistently outperforms Na\\\"ive fine-tuning and simple weight prediction,\nleading to superior downstream performance.

Our method initiates the learning process through a self-supervised\npre-training phase, utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to derive\ninitial pseudo-labels from the data's inherent structure, thereby creating a\ncold-start model without any initial oracle interaction. Subsequently, the\nmodel is refined through an active learning loop that strategically queries a\nsimulated noisy oracle for labels. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets from different domains, including financial credibility, career\nsuccess rate, and socio-economic status. The results demonstrate that our\ncold-start approach outperforms standard active learning strategies that begin\nfrom a blank slate, achieving higher accuracy with substantially fewer labeled\npairs. Our framework offers a practical and effective solution to mitigate the\ncold-start problem, enhancing the sample efficiency and applicability of\npreference learning in data-constrained environments.

Our main contributions are: (1) a novel,\nautomated dataset creation paradigm using a masking strategy; (2) a new\nhallucination evaluation dataset derived from S&P 500 annual reports; and (3) a\ncomprehensive evaluation of intrinsic hallucination patterns in\nstate-of-the-art LLMs on financial tabular data. Our work provides a robust\nmethodology for in-house LLM evaluation and serves as a critical step toward\nbuilding more trustworthy and reliable financial Generative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u8de8\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u6863\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u5bf9LLMs\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9519\u8bef\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u91d1\u878d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u521b\u5efa\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6765\u81eaS&P 500\u5e74\u62a5\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLMs\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u751f\u6210AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Propensity score-based weighting methods are widely used to\naddress this issue by reweighting samples to simulate a randomized controlled\ntrial (RCT). However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily depends on the\nobserved data and the accuracy of the propensity score estimator.

To this end, we allow the novice to say: \"I\nplan to do this, but I am uncertain.\" We introduce the Active Skill-level Data\nAggregation (ASkDAgger) framework, which leverages teacher feedback on the\nnovice plan in three key ways: (1) S-Aware Gating (SAG): Adjusts the gating\nthreshold to track sensitivity, specificity, or a minimum success rate; (2)\nForesight Interactive Experience Replay (FIER), which recasts valid and\nrelabeled novice action plans into demonstrations; and (3) Prioritized\nInteractive Experience Replay (PIER), which prioritizes replay based on\nuncertainty, novice success, and demonstration age.

Despite offering strong performance\nand computational efficiency, large MoE-based LLMs like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and\nKimi-K2-Instruct present serious challenges due to substantial memory\nrequirements in deployment. While recent works have explored MoE compression to\naddress this issue, existing methods often suffer from considerable accuracy\ndrops (e.g., 7-14% relatively) even at modest compression rates. This paper\nintroduces a novel Mixture-of-Basis-Experts (MoBE) method that achieves model\ncompression while incurring minimal accuracy drops. Specifically, each up/gate\nmatrix in an expert is decomposed via a rank decomposition as W = AB, where\nmatrix A is unique to each expert.

MLPs are represented as signed, weighted\nbipartite graphs from a network science perspective. We contrast easy and hard\nclassification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that\nbinarizing weights in hard-task models collapses accuracy to chance, whereas\neasy-task models remain robust. We also find that pruning low-magnitude edges\nin binarized hard-task models reveals a sharp phase-transition in performance.\nMoreover, moderate noise injection can enhance accuracy, resembling a\nstochastic-resonance effect linked to optimal sign flips of small-magnitude\nweights. Finally, preserving only the sign structure-instead of precise weight\nmagnitudes-through bipartite network randomizations suffices to maintain high\naccuracy.
