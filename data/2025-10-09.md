*Abdur Rehman Anwar Qureshi,Adrian Rebmann,Timotheus Kampik,Matthias Weidlich,Mathias Weske*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将命令式流程模型转换为可在关系数据库上执行的SQL查询的方法，用于在数据驱动的流程管理中实现一致性检查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决命令式流程模型与关系数据库中结构化流程执行数据之间的鸿沟，避免现有流程模型在数据驱动流程分析中的未充分利用问题。

Method: 开发了一种将命令式流程模型转换为宽松流程数据查询（特别是SQL查询）的方法，利用行为足迹和其他声明性方法。

Result: 研究结果表明命令式流程模型在数据驱动流程管理中仍然具有相关性，并且行为足迹等方法对于整合基于模型和数据驱动的流程管理至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过将命令式模型转换为可执行的SQL查询，成功弥合了传统流程建模与数据驱动流程分析之间的差距，提升了流程模型的利用价值。

Abstract: Business process management is increasingly practiced using data-driven
approaches. Still, classical imperative process models, which are typically
formalized using Petri nets, are not straightforwardly applicable to the
relational databases that contain much of the available structured process
execution data. This creates a gap between the traditional world of process
modeling and recent developments around data-driven process analysis,
ultimately leading to the under-utilization of often readily available process
models. In this paper, we close this gap by providing an approach for
translating imperative models into relaxed process data queries, specifically
SQL queries executable on relational databases, for conformance checking. Our
results show the continued relevance of imperative process models to
data-driven process management, as well as the importance of behavioral
footprints and other declarative approaches for integrating model-based and
data-driven process management.

### [2] [Automated Discovery of Test Oracles for Database Management Systems Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06663)
*Qiuyang Mang,Runyuan He,Suyang Zhong,Xiaoxuan Liu,Huanchen Zhang,Alvin Cheung*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Argus是一个基于LLM的自动化DBMS测试框架，通过生成受约束的抽象查询对来发现和实例化测试预言，解决了DBMS测试中手动设计测试预言的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DBMS自动化测试技术虽然能发现大量bug，但其核心组件测试预言的设计仍需要人工完成。LLMs具有创造性但存在幻觉问题，且调用成本高，需要一种方法来自动化测试预言的发现和实例化。

Method: 提出Argus框架，核心概念是受约束的抽象查询（包含占位符及其实例化条件的SQL骨架）。使用LLMs生成语义等价的查询骨架对，通过SQL等价求解器进行形式化验证确保正确性，然后用LLMs合成具体SQL片段实例化占位符生成复杂测试用例。

Result: 在5个经过广泛测试的DBMS上评估Argus，发现了40个未知bug（其中35个是逻辑bug），36个已确认，26个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: Argus成功证明了使用LLMs自动化发现和实例化测试预言的可行性，显著推进了完全自动化DBMS测试的发展，同时通过形式化验证解决了LLMs幻觉问题。

Abstract: Since 2020, automated testing for Database Management Systems (DBMSs) has
flourished, uncovering hundreds of bugs in widely-used systems. A cornerstone
of these techniques is test oracle, which typically implements a mechanism to
generate equivalent query pairs, thereby identifying bugs by checking the
consistency between their results. However, while applying these oracles can be
automated, their design remains a fundamentally manual endeavor. This paper
explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the discovery and
instantiation of test oracles, addressing a long-standing bottleneck towards
fully automated DBMS testing. Although LLMs demonstrate impressive creativity,
they are prone to hallucinations that can produce numerous false positive bug
reports. Furthermore, their significant monetary cost and latency mean that LLM
invocations should be limited to ensure that bug detection is efficient and
economical.
  To this end, we introduce Argus, a novel framework built upon the core
concept of the Constrained Abstract Query - a SQL skeleton containing
placeholders and their associated instantiation conditions (e.g., requiring a
placeholder to be filled by a boolean column). Argus uses LLMs to generate
pairs of these skeletons that are asserted to be semantically equivalent. This
equivalence is then formally proven using a SQL equivalence solver to ensure
soundness. Finally, the placeholders within the verified skeletons are
instantiated with concrete, reusable SQL snippets that are also synthesized by
LLMs to efficiently produce complex test cases. We implemented Argus and
evaluated it on five extensively tested DBMSs, discovering 40 previously
unknown bugs, 35 of which are logic bugs, with 36 confirmed and 26 already
fixed by the developers.

### [3] [Relational Database Distillation: From Structured Tables to Condensed Graph Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06980)
*Xinyi Gao,Jingxi Zhang,Lijian Chen,Tong Chen,Lizhen Cui,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出关系数据库蒸馏(RDD)方法，将大规模关系数据库压缩为紧凑的异构图，同时保持预测能力，解决现有图表示学习方法存储开销大、训练时间长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关系数据库中的图表示学习方法虽然性能优越，但面临存储开销过大和训练时间过长的问题，主要由于数据库规模庞大和跨表消息传递的计算负担。

Method: 通过将多模态列信息保留为节点特征，主外键关系编码为异质边，设计基于核岭回归和伪标签的目标函数，避免传统双层蒸馏框架的低效性。

Result: 在多个真实世界关系数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著减小数据规模，同时在分类和回归任务上保持有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 关系数据库蒸馏为可扩展的关系数据库学习提供了有效途径，在保持预测能力的同时大幅降低存储和计算成本。

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) underpin the majority of global data management
systems, where information is structured into multiple interdependent tables.
To effectively use the knowledge within RDBs for predictive tasks, recent
advances leverage graph representation learning to capture complex inter-table
relations as multi-hop dependencies. Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance, these methods remain hindered by the prohibitive storage overhead
and excessive training time, due to the massive scale of the database and the
computational burden of intensive message passing across interconnected tables.
To alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational
Database Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs
into compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e.,
utility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column
information is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key
relations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data
fidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse
downstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level
distillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided
objective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled
graph. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world RDBs demonstrate that our
solution substantially reduces the data size while maintaining competitive
performance on classification and regression tasks, creating an effective
pathway for scalable learning with RDBs.

### [4] [On the Expressiveness of Languages for Querying Property Graphs in Relational Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07062)
*Hadar Rotschield,Liat Peterfreund*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SQL/PGQ标准在属性图查询中的表达能力分析，揭示了图创建在决定表达能力中的核心作用，形成了严格的表达能力层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SQL/PGQ标准在属性图查询中的表达能力，特别关注图创建操作对查询能力的影响。

Method: 形式化分析SQL/PGQ的三个片段：只读核心、读写扩展以及具有更丰富视图定义的扩展变体。

Result: 只读片段严格弱于读写片段，后者仍低于NL复杂度类。扩展视图定义可捕获完整的NL查询能力，形成严格的表达能力层次。

Conclusion: 图创建在属性图查询中起核心作用，在有序结构上层次结构会坍缩，体现了视图构造在属性图查询中的重要性。

Abstract: SQL/PGQ is the emerging ISO standard for querying property graphs defined as
views over relational data. We formalize its expressive power across three
fragments: the read-only core, the read-write extension, and an extended
variant with richer view definitions. Our results show that graph creation
plays a central role in determining the expressiveness. The read-only fragment
is strictly weaker than the read-write fragment, and the latter is still below
the complexity class NL. Extending view definitions with arbitrary arity
identifiers closes this gap: the extended fragment captures exactly NL. This
yields a strict hierarchy of SQL/PGQ fragments, whose union covers all NL
queries. On ordered structures the hierarchy collapses: once arity-2
identifiers are allowed, higher arities add no power, mirroring the classical
transitive-closure collapse and underscoring the central role of view
construction in property graph querying.

### [5] [A doubly composite Chernoff-Stein lemma and its applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06342)
*Ludovico Lami*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文建立了适用于复合假设和真正相关分布的广义Chernoff-Stein引理，扩展了经典结果，并提供了在缺乏置换对称性情况下的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Chernoff-Stein引理主要针对简单假设和独立同分布情况，对于复合假设和真正相关的概率分布缺乏通用理论框架。

Method: 使用符号级模糊技术，这是广义量子Stein引理中模糊技术的改进版本，使其在缺乏置换对称性时仍适用。

Result: 得到了严格的广义Chernoff-Stein引理，严格包含了大多数先前工作，并提供了单字母公式来描述Stein指数。

Conclusion: 该工作为复合假设和真正相关分布的假设检验提供了通用理论框架，并在量子假设检验中有相关应用。

Abstract: Given a sequence of random variables $X^n=X_1,\ldots, X_n$, discriminating
between two hypotheses on the underlying probability distribution is a key task
in statistics and information theory. Of interest here is the Stein exponent,
i.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a
vanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and
i.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative
entropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of
this result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings
where the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but
rather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components
taken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that
applies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely
correlated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both
hypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either
hypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved
using a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the
generalised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 2025]. In this
refined form, blurring is applied symbol by symbol, which makes it both
stronger and applicable also in the absence of permutational symmetry. The
second part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter
formula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad
families of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying
alternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction'
statement that covers a wide family of convex constraints. Applications to
quantum hypothesis testing are explored in a related paper [Lami, arXiv:today].

### [6] [$α$-leakage Interpretation of Rényi Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06622)
*Ni Ding,Farhad Farokhi,Tao Guo,Yinfei Xu,Xiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文揭示了Sibson互信息与α泄漏之间的关系，提出了Y-基本α泄漏概念，扩展了点态最大泄漏到整个Rényi阶范围，并给出了实现δ-近似α泄漏的充分条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究信息泄漏的量化方法，特别是针对Sibson互信息和α泄漏的理论关系，为信息安全中的隐私保护提供更精确的数学工具。

Method: 通过定义f̃-均值相对信息增益，将Sibson互信息解释为α泄漏的均值形式，提出Y-基本α泄漏概念，并利用交替最大-最大方法实现广义Blahut-Arimoto算法。

Result: 证明了Sibson互信息可以表示为α泄漏在通道输出Y基本事件上的均值，提出了扩展的点态泄漏概念，并给出了实现近似泄漏的充分条件。

Conclusion: 该研究为信息泄漏理论提供了新的解释框架，将Sibson互信息与α泄漏联系起来，扩展了点态泄漏概念，并为实际应用提供了算法实现方法。

Abstract: For $\tilde{f}(t) = \exp(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}t)$, this paper shows that
the Sibson mutual information is an $\alpha$-leakage averaged over the
adversary's $\tilde{f}$-mean relative information gain (on the secret) at
elementary event of channel output $Y$ as well as the joint occurrence of
elementary channel input $X$ and output $Y$. This interpretation is used to
derive a sufficient condition that achieves a $\delta$-approximation of
$\epsilon$-upper bounded $\alpha$-leakage. A $Y$-elementary $\alpha$-leakage is
proposed, extending the existing pointwise maximal leakage to the overall
R\'{e}nyi order range $\alpha \in [0,\infty)$. Maximizing this $Y$-elementary
leakage over all attributes $U$ of channel input $X$ gives the R\'{e}nyi
divergence. Further, the R\'{e}nyi capacity is interpreted as the maximal
$\tilde{f}$-mean information leakage over both the adversary's malicious
inference decision and the channel input $X$ (represents the adversary's prior
belief). This suggests an alternating max-max implementation of the existing
generalized Blahut-Arimoto method.

### [7] [Optimizing Fronthaul Quantization for Flexible User Load in Cell-Free Massive MIMO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06734)
*Fabian Göttsch,Max Franke,Arash Pourdamghani,Giuseppe Caire,Stefan Schmid*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究可扩展用户中心无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统的物理层频谱效率和前传网络负载，通过优化量化率和前传路由来平衡系统性能与网络负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户中心无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统中，前传链路容量有限，需要量化传输数据，但量化会影响物理层性能，需要找到平衡点。

Method: 使用混合整数线性规划联合优化集群处理器位置和前传流量路由，并基于率失真理论计算量化率参数。

Result: 优化量化率后，前传负载在广泛用户负载范围内保持稳定，且物理层性能损失不明显。

Conclusion: 无蜂窝大规模MIMO系统和前传网络对用户密度变化具有弹性，可通过优化量化率实现稳定性能。

Abstract: We investigate the physical layer (PHY) spectral efficiency and fronthaul
network load of a scalable user-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Each
user-centric cluster processor responsible for cluster-level signal processing
is located at one of multiple decentralized units (DUs). Thus, the radio units
in the cluster must exchange data with the corresponding DU over the fronthaul.
Because the fronthaul links have limited capacity, this data must be quantized
before it is sent over the fronthaul. We consider a routed fronthaul network,
where the cluster processor placement and fronthaul traffic routing are jointly
optimized with a mixed-integer linear program. For different numbers of users
in the network, we investigate the effect of fronthaul quantization rates, a
system parameter computed based on rate-distortion theory. Our results show
that with optimized quantization rates, the fronthaul load is quite stable for
a wide range of user loads without significant PHY performance loss. This
demonstrates that the cell-free massive MIMO PHY and fronthaul network are
resilient to varying user densities.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度哈希蒸馏的DeepJSCC方法，通过语义聚类提升多跳AWGN信道中图像传输的语义一致性和感知重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决经典DeepJSCC在多跳传输中可能面临的噪声累积问题，同时增强语义一致性以支持安全应用。

Method: 训练DeepJSCC编码器-解码器对，结合预训练的深度哈希蒸馏模块，同时最小化MSE和源图像与重建图像DHD哈希的余弦距离。

Result: 在不同多跳设置下显著提升了感知质量，通过LPIPS指标验证了语义对齐的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义对齐有效改善了多跳信道中的图像传输质量，为安全应用提供了更好的语义一致性保障。

Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding
(DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by
training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash
distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating
security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and
improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module
to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD
hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual
quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different
multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise
accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS)
metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有捏合天线技术研究主要集中在单细胞场景，忽略了来自连接到空间分布基站的不同波导的干扰天线的影响，需要填补这一知识空白。

Method: 应用随机几何工具进行系统建模，推导出中断概率的解析表达式，并通过仿真验证分析准确性。

Result: 仿真结果验证了分析的准确性，并证明了捏合天线系统相比固定天线系统具有更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多细胞捏合天线系统的性能评估提供了一个有效的分析框架，证明了该技术在干扰环境下的优势。

Abstract: Recently, the study on pinching-antenna technique has attracted significant
attention. However, most relevant literature focuses on a single-cell scenario,
where the effect from the interfering pinching-antennas on waveguides connected
to spatially distributed base stations (BSs) was ignored. To fulfill this
knowledge gap, this letter aims to provide an analytical framework on
performance evaluation for multi-cell pinching-antenna systems where spatially
distributed waveguides which are connected to different BSs are considered. In
particular, tools from stochastic geometry is applied for system modeling. The
expression for the outage probability is obtained. Simulation results are
provided to verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the superior
performance of pinching-antenna system compared to fixed-antenna systems.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 该研究对时间序列数据的无损压缩方法进行了大规模比较分析，提出了包含数据变换和熵编码两阶段的统一框架，并通过消融实验揭示了不同算法在不同时间序列特性下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字世界产生前所未有的数据量，需要高效管理、传输和存储数据以节省资源并实现可扩展性。数据压缩在其中一直是关键技术，但缺乏对时间序列数据压缩方法的系统性比较研究。

Method: 提出了包含数据变换和熵编码两阶段的统一压缩框架，在合成和真实数据集上评估各种压缩算法，通过每个压缩阶段的消融研究来分析各组件对整体压缩性能的影响。

Result: 研究揭示了不同算法在面对多样化时间序列特性时的优缺点，表明配置良好且完整的压缩流水线比单个组件或算法更重要。

Conclusion: 该研究为针对特定数据集选择和组合最合适的压缩算法提供了全面指南，强调了完整压缩流水线的重要性。

Abstract: Our increasingly digital and connected world has led to the generation of
unprecedented amounts of data. This data must be efficiently managed,
transmitted, and stored to preserve resources and allow scalability. Data
compression has therein been a key technology for a long time, resulting in a
vast landscape of available techniques. This largest-to-date study analyzes and
compares various lossless data compression methods for time series data. We
present a unified framework encompassing two stages: data transformation and
entropy encoding. We evaluate compression algorithms across both synthetic and
real-world datasets with varying characteristics. Through ablation studies at
each compression stage, we isolate the impact of individual components on
overall compression performance -- revealing the strengths and weaknesses of
different algorithms when facing diverse time series properties. Our study
underscores the importance of well-configured and complete compression
pipelines beyond individual components or algorithms; it offers a comprehensive
guide for selecting and composing the most appropriate compression algorithms
tailored to specific datasets.

### [11] [Robustness of Covariance Estimators with Application in Activity Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07044)

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个通用的协方差估计器类别，并应用于多天线随机接入中的活动检测问题。该估计器通过实值函数g和模型协方差矩阵集合H构建，具有鲁棒性。在活动检测中，将大规模衰落系数恢复问题转化为结构化协方差估计问题，提出了基于有符号核条件的码本设计。

Conclusion: 提出的通用协方差估计器框架具有理论鲁棒性保证，并能有效应用于多天线随机接入系统的活动检测问题，通过适当的码本设计可实现大规模衰落系数的可靠恢复。

Abstract: The first part of this work considers a general class of covariance
estimators. Each estimator of that class is generated by a real-valued function
$g$ and a set of model covariance matrices $H$. If $\bf{W}$ is a potentially
perturbed observation of a searched covariance matrix, then the estimator is
the minimizer of the sum of $g$ applied to each eigenvalue of
$\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}\bf{Z}^{-1}\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}$ under the constraint that
$\bf{Z}$ is from $H$. It is shown that under mild conditions on $g$ and $H$
such estimators are robust, meaning the estimation error can be made
arbitrarily small if the perturbation of $\bf{W}$ gets small enough. \par In
the second part of this work the previous results are applied to activity
detection in random access with multiple receive antennas. In activity
detection recovering the large scale fading coefficients is a sparse recovery
problem which can be reduced to a structured covariance estimation problem. The
recovery can be done with a non-negative least squares estimator or with a
relaxed maximum likelihood estimator. It is shown that under suitable
assumptions on the distributions of the noise and the channel coefficients, the
relaxed maximum likelihood estimator is from the general class of covariance
estimators considered in the first part of this work. Then, codebooks based
upon a signed kernel condition are proposed. It is shown that with the proposed
codebooks both estimators can recover the large-scale fading coefficients if
the number of receive antennas is high enough and
$S\leq\left\lceil\frac{1}{2}M^2\right\rceil-1$ where $S$ is the number of
active users and $M$ is number of pilot symbols per user.

Conclusion: 提出的理论驱动码本设计能有效提升语义通信性能，通过优化量化效率和抗噪能力实现了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: The use of a learnable codebook provides an efficient way for semantic
communications to map vector-based high-dimensional semantic features onto
discrete symbol representations required in digital communication systems. In
this paper, the problem of codebook-enabled quantization mapping for digital
semantic communications is studied from the perspective of information theory.
Particularly, a novel theoretically-grounded codebook design is proposed for
jointly optimizing quantization efficiency, transmission efficiency, and robust
performance. First, a formal equivalence is established between the one-to-many
synonymous mapping defined in semantic information theory and the many-to-one
quantization mapping based on the codebook's Voronoi partitions. Then, the
mutual information between semantic features and their quantized indices is
derived in order to maximize semantic information carried by discrete indices.
To realize the semantic maximum in practice, an entropy-regularized
quantization loss based on empirical estimation is introduced for end-to-end
codebook training. Next, the physical channel-induced semantic distortion and
the optimal codebook size for semantic communications are characterized under
bit-flip errors and semantic distortion. To mitigate the semantic distortion
caused by physical channel noise, a novel channel-aware semantic distortion
loss is proposed. Simulation results on image reconstruction tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed theoretically-grounded codebook that
achieves a 24.1% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and a 46.5%
improvement in learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) compared to
the existing codebook designs when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 10 dB.

TL;DR: 提出了三种在边差分隐私下进行谱图聚类的机制：边翻转加邻接矩阵混洗、降维投影加高斯噪声、以及带噪声的幂迭代方法，这些方法在保护隐私的同时保持了图的谱特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在边差分隐私约束下进行谱图聚类的问题，需要在保护图结构隐私的同时保持聚类的有效性。

Method: 1) 边翻转结合邻接矩阵混洗；2) 降维投影加高斯噪声；3) 带噪声的幂迭代方法。

Result: 理论分析提供了严格的隐私保证和误分类错误率的精确刻画，在合成和真实网络上的实验验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 提出的机制在边差分隐私下实现了有效的谱图聚类，展示了实用的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential
privacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation
via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which
enforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph.
Importantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping
edges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP
guarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves
(epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of
nodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a
lower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity;
and (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across
iterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis
provides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the
misclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks
validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility
trade-offs.

short-form video recommendation system. Traditional machine learning
classifiers for content understanding face protracted development cycles and a
lack of deep, nuanced comprehension. The "LLM-as-annotators" approach addresses
these by significantly shortening development times and enabling the annotation
of subtle attributes. This work details an end-to-end workflow encompassing:
(1) iterative definition and robust evaluation of target attributes, refined by
offline metrics and online A/B testing; (2) scalable offline bulk annotation of
video corpora using LLMs with multimodal features, optimized inference, and
knowledge distillation for broad application; and (3) integration of these rich
annotations into the online recommendation serving system, for example, through
personalized restrict retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of this approach, with LLMs outperforming human raters in offline annotation
quality for nuanced attributes and yielding significant improvements of user
participation and satisfied consumption in online A/B tests. The study provides
insights into designing and scaling production-level LLM pipelines for rich
content evaluation, highlighting the adaptability and benefits of LLM-generated
nuanced understanding for enhancing content discovery, user satisfaction, and
the overall effectiveness of modern recommendation systems.

*Jiaman He,Zikang Leng,Dana McKay,Damiano Spina,Johanne R. Trippas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种统计评估方法，用于测试LLM是否能与人类标注者群体融合而无法区分，而不仅仅是评估标注正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越单纯评估LLM标注正确性的传统方法，探索LLM是否能模拟人类主观判断，作为替代标注机制。

Method: 基于Krippendorff's α、配对自举法和TOST等效性检验的统计评估方法，测试LLM是否能在统计上与人类标注者无法区分。

Result: 在MovieLens 100K数据集上LLM与人类标注者统计上无法区分(p=0.004)，但在PolitiFact数据集上可区分(p=0.155)，显示任务依赖性差异。

Conclusion: 该方法可在小样本人类数据上进行早期评估，判断LLM是否适合特定应用的大规模标注任务。

Abstract: Many evaluations of large language models (LLMs) in text annotation focus
primarily on the correctness of the output, typically comparing model-generated
labels to human-annotated ``ground truth'' using standard performance metrics.
In contrast, our study moves beyond effectiveness alone. We aim to explore how
labeling decisions -- by both humans and LLMs -- can be statistically evaluated
across individuals. Rather than treating LLMs purely as annotation systems, we
approach LLMs as an alternative annotation mechanism that may be capable of
mimicking the subjective judgments made by humans. To assess this, we develop a
statistical evaluation method based on Krippendorff's $\alpha$, paired
bootstrapping, and the Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) equivalence test procedure.
This evaluation method tests whether an LLM can blend into a group of human
annotators without being distinguishable.
  We apply this approach to two datasets -- MovieLens 100K and PolitiFact --
and find that the LLM is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator
in the former ($p = 0.004$), but not in the latter ($p = 0.155$), highlighting
task-dependent differences. It also enables early evaluation on a small sample
of human data to inform whether LLMs are suitable for large-scale annotation in
a given application.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文通过激活修补方法对神经检索模型进行因果解释性分析，验证了Chen等人的发现，并扩展了词频公理，识别出编码该公理的注意力头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经排序模型内部决策过程不透明的问题，特别是随着模型规模增大，现有解释性方法多为相关性分析而非因果关系的现状。

Method: 采用激活修补这一因果解释性方法，在信息检索领域建立框架，分析注意力头和层在计算文档相关性中的作用。

Result: 验证了神经排序模型不仅捕获词频信息，还能将表征定位到特定组件；成功识别出编码词频公理的注意力头组。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解神经排序模型内部决策过程提供了新视角，证明了预定义检索公理在模型中的存在，有助于提升模型透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Neural ranking models have shown outstanding performance across a variety of
tasks, such as document retrieval, re-ranking, question answering and
conversational retrieval. However, the inner decision process of these models
remains largely unclear, especially as models increase in size. Most
interpretability approaches, such as probing, focus on correlational insights
rather than establishing causal relationships. The paper 'Axiomatic Causal
Interventions for Reverse Engineering Relevance Computation in Neural Retrieval
Models' by Chen et al. addresses this gap by introducing a framework for
activation patching - a causal interpretability method - in the information
retrieval domain, offering insights into how neural retrieval models compute
document relevance. The study demonstrates that neural ranking models not only
capture term-frequency information, but also that these representations can be
localized to specific components of the model, such as individual attention
heads or layers. This paper aims to reproduce the findings by Chen et al. and
to further explore the presence of pre-defined retrieval axioms in neural IR
models. We validate the main claims made by Chen et al., and extend the
framework to include an additional term-frequency axiom, which states that the
impact of increasing query term frequency on document ranking diminishes as the
frequency becomes higher. We successfully identify a group of attention heads
that encode this axiom and analyze their behavior to give insight into the
inner decision-making process of neural ranking models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于LLM的自动术语提取模型，通过生成伪标签和微调的方法，在7个不同领域上超越了现有方法，平均提升10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的自动术语提取方法需要昂贵的人工标注且难以跨领域迁移，限制了实际部署。需要更鲁棒、可扩展的解决方案和更现实的评估设置。

Method: 首先使用黑盒LLM在通用和科学领域生成伪标签以确保泛化性，然后微调首个用于ATE的LLM，最后引入轻量级后处理启发式方法增强文档级一致性。

Result: 在7个领域中的5个领域超越了先前方法，平均提升10个百分点，与GPT-4o教师模型表现相当。

Conclusion: 提出的LLM-based方法在自动术语提取任务上表现优异，发布了数据集和微调模型以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Automatic Term Extraction (ATE) is a critical component in downstream NLP
tasks such as document tagging, ontology construction and patent analysis.
Current state-of-the-art methods require expensive human annotation and
struggle with domain transfer, limiting their practical deployment. This
highlights the need for more robust, scalable solutions and realistic
evaluation settings. To address this, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark
spanning seven diverse domains, enabling performance evaluation at both the
document- and corpus-levels. Furthermore, we propose a robust LLM-based model
that outperforms both supervised cross-domain encoder models and few-shot
learning baselines and performs competitively with its GPT-4o teacher on this
benchmark. The first step of our approach is generating psuedo-labels with this
black-box LLM on general and scientific domains to ensure generalizability.
Building on this data, we fine-tune the first LLMs for ATE. To further enhance
document-level consistency, oftentimes needed for downstream tasks, we
introduce lightweight post-hoc heuristics. Our approach exceeds previous
approaches on 5/7 domains with an average improvement of 10 percentage points.
We release our dataset and fine-tuned models to support future research in this
area.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着检索增强生成(RAG)的广泛应用，强大的检索模型变得尤为重要。在医疗领域，结合文本和图像的多模态检索模型对问答、跨模态检索等任务具有重要价值，但目前缺乏标准基准来评估这些模型在医疗环境中的表现。

Method: 创建M3Retrieve多模态医疗检索基准，该基准跨越5个领域、16个医学专业和4个不同任务，收集了超过120万文本文档和16.4万多模态查询，所有数据均在批准许可下收集。

Conclusion: 通过发布M3Retrieve，旨在实现系统化评估，促进模型创新，并加速构建更强大可靠的医疗多模态检索系统的研究。数据集和基线代码已公开。

Abstract: With the increasing use of RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), strong
retrieval models have become more important than ever. In healthcare,
multimodal retrieval models that combine information from both text and images
offer major advantages for many downstream tasks such as question answering,
cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal summarization, since medical data often
includes both formats. However, there is currently no standard benchmark to
evaluate how well these models perform in medical settings. To address this
gap, we introduce M3Retrieve, a Multimodal Medical Retrieval Benchmark.
M3Retrieve, spans 5 domains,16 medical fields, and 4 distinct tasks, with over
1.2 Million text documents and 164K multimodal queries, all collected under
approved licenses. We evaluate leading multimodal retrieval models on this
benchmark to explore the challenges specific to different medical specialities
and to understand their impact on retrieval performance. By releasing
M3Retrieve, we aim to enable systematic evaluation, foster model innovation,
and accelerate research toward building more capable and reliable multimodal
retrieval systems for medical applications. The dataset and the baselines code
are available in this github page https://github.com/AkashGhosh/M3Retrieve.

*Yuxuan Lu,Yifan Wu,Jason Hartline,Lunjia Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于多类预测任务的完美真实校准度量，这是对Hartline等人[2025]二进制预测工作的推广。该度量不仅保持真实性，还表现出优越的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准度量大多不真实，会激励预测器撒谎以显得更校准。虽然Hartline等人提出了首个完美真实校准度量，但仅限于二进制预测任务。需要将这种真实校准度量扩展到多类预测场景。

Method: 研究将校准度量从二进制扩展到多类预测的常见方法，识别哪些方法能保持真实性。提出一个完美真实的多类校准度量，并证明其鲁棒性。

Result: 成功开发了一个完美真实的多类校准度量，数学证明和实证验证都表明该度量具有优越的鲁棒性，能够稳健地保持主导和被主导预测器之间的排序关系。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多类校准度量解决了现有binned ECE的非鲁棒性问题，为多类预测提供了首个完美真实的校准评估工具。

Abstract: Calibrated predictions can be reliably interpreted as probabilities. An
important step towards achieving better calibration is to design an appropriate
calibration measure to meaningfully assess the miscalibration level of a
predictor. A recent line of work initiated by Haghtalab et al. [2024] studies
the design of truthful calibration measures: a truthful measure is minimized
when a predictor outputs the true probabilities, whereas a non-truthful measure
incentivizes the predictor to lie so as to appear more calibrated. All previous
calibration measures were non-truthful until Hartline et al. [2025] introduced
the first perfectly truthful calibration measures for binary prediction tasks
in the batch setting.
  We introduce a perfectly truthful calibration measure for multi-class
prediction tasks, generalizing the work of Hartline et al. [2025] beyond binary
prediction. We study common methods of extending calibration measures from
binary to multi-class prediction and identify ones that do or do not preserve
truthfulness. In addition to truthfulness, we mathematically prove and
empirically verify that our calibration measure exhibits superior robustness:
it robustly preserves the ordering between dominant and dominated predictors,
regardless of the choice of hyperparameters (bin sizes). This result addresses
the non-robustness issue of binned ECE, which has been observed repeatedly in
prior work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RareGraph-Synth是一个基于知识图谱引导的连续时间扩散框架，用于生成真实且保护隐私的超罕见疾病电子健康记录轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超罕见疾病研究中数据稀缺和隐私保护问题，通过生成合成数据来促进研究，同时保护患者隐私。

Method: 整合五个公共资源构建异质知识图谱，使用元路径分数调节扩散模型的前向噪声调度，引导生成生物学上合理的医疗数据序列。

Result: 相比无引导扩散基线降低分类最大平均差异40%，相比GAN方法降低60%以上，同时保持下游预测效用，隐私保护效果显著。

Conclusion: 将生物医学知识图谱直接集成到扩散噪声调度中可以同时提高保真度和隐私性，为罕见疾病研究实现更安全的数据共享。

Abstract: We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion
framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic
electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases.
RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet/Orphadata, the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA
Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph
comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this
8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward
stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically
plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining
score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces
timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag
triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated
ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean
Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by
greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream
predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the
DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55
safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61
plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong
resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating
biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can
simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for
rare-disease research.

Motivation: 解决在线全预测问题，使学习者生成预测序列，让下游决策者基于预测选择行动时获得最坏情况效用保证并最小化约束违反

Method: 设计算法获得所有代理的同时动态遗憾保证，其中每个代理的遗憾是针对交互轮次中可能变化的行动序列测量的，同时确保每个代理的约束违反趋近于零

Result: 给出了第一个获得所有代理同时动态遗憾保证的算法，不需要代理自身维护任何状态，只需解决由每轮预测定义的单轮约束优化问题

Conclusion: 该算法在在线全预测框架下实现了动态遗憾保证和约束违反控制，为下游决策者提供了理论保证

Abstract: We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online
omniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced
problem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are
broadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker
has their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,
each mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or
constraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions "as
if" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to
produce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions
that give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case
constraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that
obtains simultaneous \emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --
where regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence
of actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing
constraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents
themselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained
optimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化算法容易陷入局部最优，而专家知识对加速收敛至关重要。闭源LLM虽具强大探索能力但无法更新参数，开源小模型可微调但缺乏广泛知识和推理能力

Method: MCCE框架结合冻结闭源LLM和轻量可训练模型，维护搜索过程轨迹记忆，通过强化学习逐步精炼小模型，两模型在全局探索中相互支持和补充

Result: 在多目标药物设计基准测试中，MCCE实现了最先进的帕累托前沿质量，并持续优于基线方法

Conclusion: MCCE为混合LLM系统提供了一种持续进化的新范式，结合了知识驱动的探索和经验驱动的学习

Abstract: Multi-objective discrete optimization problems, such as molecular design,
pose significant challenges due to their vast and unstructured combinatorial
spaces. Traditional evolutionary algorithms often get trapped in local optima,
while expert knowledge can provide crucial guidance for accelerating
convergence. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful priors and reasoning
ability, making them natural optimizers when expert knowledge matters. However,
closed-source LLMs, though strong in exploration, cannot update their
parameters and thus cannot internalize experience. Conversely, smaller open
models can be continually fine-tuned but lack broad knowledge and reasoning
strength. We introduce Multi-LLM Collaborative Co-evolution (MCCE), a hybrid
framework that unites a frozen closed-source LLM with a lightweight trainable
model. The system maintains a trajectory memory of past search processes; the
small model is progressively refined via reinforcement learning, with the two
models jointly supporting and complementing each other in global exploration.
Unlike model distillation, this process enhances the capabilities of both
models through mutual inspiration. Experiments on multi-objective drug design
benchmarks show that MCCE achieves state-of-the-art Pareto front quality and
consistently outperforms baselines. These results highlight a new paradigm for
enabling continual evolution in hybrid LLM systems, combining knowledge-driven
exploration with experience-driven learning.

Motivation: 神经网络中复数具有更强的表示能力，但在随机神经网络中应用有限，主要因为缺乏将实值表格数据集转换为复数表示的有效方法。

Method: 提出了两种生成复数表示的方法：自然变换和自编码器驱动方法，并基于此构建RVFL-X网络，集成复数变换到实值数据集中，同时保持原始RVFL架构的简单性和效率。

Result: 在80个实值UCI数据集上的综合评估显示，RVFL-X始终优于原始RVFL和最先进的RNN变体，展示了其在多样化应用领域的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: RVFL-X通过有效利用复数表示，显著提升了随机神经网络的性能，为处理实值数据集提供了强大的复数扩展方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural networks, supported by foundational theoretical
insights, emphasize the superior representational power of complex numbers.
However, their adoption in randomized neural networks (RNNs) has been limited
due to the lack of effective methods for transforming real-valued tabular
datasets into complex-valued representations. To address this limitation, we
propose two methods for generating complex-valued representations from
real-valued datasets: a natural transformation and an autoencoder-driven
method. Building on these mechanisms, we propose RVFL-X, a complex-valued
extension of the random vector functional link (RVFL) network. RVFL-X
integrates complex transformations into real-valued datasets while maintaining
the simplicity and efficiency of the original RVFL architecture. By leveraging
complex components such as input, weights, and activation functions, RVFL-X
processes complex representations and produces real-valued outputs.
Comprehensive evaluations on 80 real-valued UCI datasets demonstrate that
RVFL-X consistently outperforms both the original RVFL and state-of-the-art
(SOTA) RNN variants, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness across diverse
application domains.

Motivation: 目标是实现通过手机拍摄绳结照片就能自动识别绳结，将机器学习的视觉感知能力与拓扑不变量的严格数学区分相结合。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN和Transformer架构直接从图像预测交叉数，并计划结合感知模块与符号重建为平面图代码，用于下游不变量计算。

Result: 展示了即使是轻量级架构也能从图像中恢复有意义的结构信息，为绳结识别提供了简单基线。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法突显了机器学习处理噪声视觉数据与不变量强制执行严格拓扑区分之间的互补性。

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically
recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate
this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular
convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and
traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones
polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly
from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures
can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to
combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar
diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot
classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between
machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which
enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

TL;DR: 提出了关系型Transformer（RT）架构，能够在多样化关系数据库上进行预训练，并直接应用于未见过的数据集和任务，无需任务或数据集特定的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关系型领域缺乏能够跨数据集和任务迁移的架构问题，核心挑战是关系数据的多样性，包括异构模式、图结构和功能依赖。

Method: RT架构通过（i）使用表/列元数据对单元格进行标记化，（ii）通过掩码标记预测进行预训练，（iii）采用新颖的关系注意力机制，在列、行和主外键链接上进行注意力计算。

Result: 在RelBench数据集上预训练后，RT在二元分类任务中实现了强大的零样本性能，平均达到完全监督AUROC的94%，而27B参数的LLM仅为84%。微调后获得了最先进的结果和高样本效率。

Conclusion: RT为零样本迁移利用了任务-表上下文、关系注意力模式和模式语义，为关系数据的基础模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Pretrained transformers readily adapt to new sequence modeling tasks via
zero-shot prompting, but relational domains still lack architectures that
transfer across datasets and tasks. The core challenge is the diversity of
relational data, with varying heterogeneous schemas, graph structures and
functional dependencies. In this paper, we present the Relational Transformer
(RT) architecture, which can be pretrained on diverse relational databases and
directly applied to unseen datasets and tasks without task- or dataset-specific
fine-tuning, or retrieval of in-context examples. RT (i) tokenizes cells with
table/column metadata, (ii) is pretrained via masked token prediction, and
(iii) utilizes a novel \textit{Relational Attention} mechanism over columns,
rows, and primary-foreign key links. Pretrained on RelBench datasets spanning
tasks such as churn and sales forecasting, RT attains strong zero-shot
performance, averaging 94% of fully supervised AUROC on binary classification
tasks with a single forward pass of a 22M parameter model, as opposed to 84%
for a 27B LLM. Fine-tuning yields state-of-the-art results with high sample
efficiency. Our experiments show that RT's zero-shot transfer harnesses
task-table context, relational attention patterns and schema semantics.
Overall, RT provides a practical path toward foundation models for relational
data.

Conclusion: Trajectory Transformer通过transformer架构成功解决了轨迹生成中的偏差和细节丢失问题，为高质量轨迹生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread use of GPS devices has driven advances in spatiotemporal data
mining, enabling machine learning models to simulate human decision making and
generate realistic trajectories, addressing both data collection costs and
privacy concerns. Recent studies have shown the promise of diffusion models for
high-quality trajectory generation. However, most existing methods rely on
convolution based architectures (e.g. UNet) to predict noise during the
diffusion process, which often results in notable deviations and the loss of
fine-grained street-level details due to limited model capacity. In this paper,
we propose Trajectory Transformer, a novel model that employs a transformer
backbone for both conditional information embedding and noise prediction. We
explore two GPS coordinate embedding strategies, location embedding and
longitude-latitude embedding, and analyze model performance at different
scales. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that Trajectory
Transformer significantly enhances generation quality and effectively
alleviates the deviation issues observed in prior approaches.

task, critical for mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. Short-term
precipitation forecasting, or nowcasting, requires models that are not only
accurate but also computationally efficient for real-time applications. Current
methods, such as token-based autoregressive models, often suffer from flawed
inductive biases and slow inference, while diffusion models can be
computationally intensive. To address these limitations, we introduce BlockGPT,
a generative autoregressive transformer using batched tokenization (Block)
method that predicts full two-dimensional fields (frames) at each time step.
Conceived as a model-agnostic paradigm for video prediction, BlockGPT
factorizes space-time by using self-attention within each frame and causal
attention across frames; in this work, we instantiate it for precipitation
nowcasting. We evaluate BlockGPT on two precipitation datasets, viz. KNMI
(Netherlands) and SEVIR (U.S.), comparing it to state-of-the-art baselines
including token-based (NowcastingGPT) and diffusion-based (DiffCast+Phydnet)
models. The results show that BlockGPT achieves superior accuracy, event
localization as measured by categorical metrics, and inference speeds up to 31x
faster than comparable baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究了标签噪声对深度学习模型隐藏表示的影响，发现隐藏表示的信息内容随网络参数数量呈现双下降现象，与测试误差行为类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界数据集中的标签常因标注错误而存在噪声，虽然标签噪声对深度学习模型性能的影响已被广泛研究，但其对网络隐藏表示的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 使用信息不平衡（Information Imbalance）作为条件互信息的计算高效代理，系统比较隐藏表示。

Result: 在欠参数化机制下，带噪声标签学习的表示比干净标签更具信息性；在过参数化机制下，这些表示具有同等信息性。过参数化网络的表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 过参数化网络的隐藏表示对标签噪声具有鲁棒性，这为理解分类任务中的泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: In supervised classification tasks, models are trained to predict a label for
each data point. In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to
annotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep
learning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden
representations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically
comparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a
computationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this
analysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations
follows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,
akin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the
underparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more
informative than those learned with clean labels, while in the
overparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our
results indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are
robust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the
penultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the
overparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding
generalization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to
representations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse
than random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives
networks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels
information.

Abstract: Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data
science lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their
competitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important
contributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data
science and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are
involved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or
cyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible
in a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after
reaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate
data science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new
technique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,
agility and iterative approach to business processes.

TL;DR: SDAR是一种协同扩散-自回归范式，将自回归模型的训练效率与扩散模型的并行推理能力相结合，通过轻量级范式转换将训练好的AR模型转化为块状扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合自回归模型的计算效率和扩散模型的并行推理能力，避免昂贵的端到端扩散训练，实现高效的自回归到扩散转换。

Method: 通过轻量级、数据高效的适应过程将训练好的自回归模型转换为块状扩散模型，在推理时跨块自回归生成以确保全局一致性，同时在每个块内通过离散扩散过程并行解码所有token。

Result: SDAR以最小成本实现AR到扩散的高效转换，保持AR级别性能的同时支持并行生成。30B MoE模型在GPQA和ChemBench等科学推理基准上超越AR对应模型，在多数投票和pass@k等测试时缩放方法下获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: SDAR建立了一个实用的范式，结合了自回归和扩散的优势，实现可扩展、高吞吐量的推理。

Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies
the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference
capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR
performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained
autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,
data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences
autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens
within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive
experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient
than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.
Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion
with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel
generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures
confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger
robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups
without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning
and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on
challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and
gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting
and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that
combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable,
high-throughput reasoning.

Motivation: 研究基础模型在复杂动态系统（如重症监护）中的决策能力，解决高维诅咒和自适应建模的挑战，探索AI在现实领域超越人类策略的可能性。

Method: 提出分散式小代理网络架构，每个代理只覆盖系统功能的子集，通过群体学习实现自适应，避免单一基础模型的维度诅咒问题。

Result: 分散式小代理网络在动态环境中能提供优于单一基础模型的决策能力，但代价是细节可重现性降低。

Conclusion: 在复杂动态系统中，分散式小代理网络架构比单一基础模型更适合实现自适应决策，AI需要在这些场景中证明明显优势才能承担更广泛的决策角色。

Abstract: Foundation models have rapidly advanced AI, raising the question of whether
their decisions will ultimately surpass human strategies in real-world domains.
The exponential, and possibly super-exponential, pace of AI development makes
such analysis elusive. Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for
daily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is
diagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.
  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.
Effective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly
interacting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires
reliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins
of highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively
understood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI
models with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge
extends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these
settings before assuming broader decision-making roles.
  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient
self-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual
limits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized
architecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents
representing the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent
covers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical
results on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing
applications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable
self-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments
compared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced
reproducibility in detail.

Motivation: 无人机通信需要既准确又可解释的A2G信道模型，但确定性模型过于刚性，深度学习模型缺乏可解释性

Method: 提出物理启发的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(PIKAN)，将自由空间路径损耗、双射线反射等物理原理作为灵活归纳偏置嵌入学习过程

Result: 在无人机A2G测量数据上，PIKAN达到与深度学习模型相当的精度，仅用232个参数，比多层感知机轻37倍，同时提供符号化可解释表达式

Conclusion: PIKAN是5G+和6G网络中无人机信道建模的高效、可解释且可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications demand accurate yet
interpretable air-to-ground (A2G) channel models that can adapt to
nonstationary propagation environments. While deterministic models offer
interpretability and deep learning (DL) models provide accuracy, both
approaches suffer from either rigidity or a lack of explainability. To bridge
this gap, we propose the Physics-Inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PIKAN)
that embeds physical principles (e.g., free-space path loss, two-ray
reflections) into the learning process. Unlike physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs), PIKAN is more flexible for applying physical information because it
introduces them as flexible inductive biases. Thus, it enables a more flexible
training process. Experiments on UAV A2G measurement data show that PIKAN
achieves comparable accuracy to DL models while providing symbolic and
explainable expressions aligned with propagation laws. Remarkably, PIKAN
achieves this performance with only 232 parameters, making it up to 37 times
lighter than multilayer perceptron (MLP) baselines with thousands of
parameters, without sacrificing correlation with measurements and also
providing symbolic expressions. These results highlight PIKAN as an efficient,
interpretable, and scalable solution for UAV channel modelling in beyond-5G and
6G networks.

Method: 使用Helmholtz指标评估ODE与欧拉-拉格朗日方程的相似度，结合二阶神经ODE构建拉格朗日神经ODE。

Conclusion: Helmholtz指标和拉格朗日神经ODE能有效识别物理系统并提升学习性能。

Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in
particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is
an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this
resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several
fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE
to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations
in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate
that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and
non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法使用深度强化学习或计算资源有限的情况下（如通用游戏博弈），需要一种更有效的MCTS算法来替代GRAVE算法。

Method: 在节点探索项中包含从根节点到该节点路径上所有走法的统计信息，使用抽象编码代替精确编码来改进置换统计和AMAF统计，并提供改进的统计源加权公式。

Result: 在多种游戏（棋盘游戏、战争游戏、投资游戏、视频游戏和多人游戏）上测试，MCPS在双人游戏中表现优于GRAVE，在多人游戏中表现相当，且对ref超参数不敏感。

Conclusion: MCPS是GRAVE的有效改进，消除了偏差超参数的需求，在双人游戏中表现更优，且通过抽象编码进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: We propose Monte Carlo Permutation Search (MCPS), a general-purpose Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm that improves upon the GRAVE algorithm. MCPS
is relevant when deep reinforcement learning is not an option, or when the
computing power available before play is not substantial, such as in General
Game Playing, for example. The principle of MCPS is to include in the
exploration term of a node the statistics on all the playouts that contain all
the moves on the path from the root to the node. We extensively test MCPS on a
variety of games: board games, wargame, investment game, video game and
multi-player games. MCPS has better results than GRAVE in all the two-player
games. It has equivalent results for multi-player games because these games are
inherently balanced even when players have different strengths. We also show
that using abstract codes for moves instead of exact codes can be beneficial to
both MCPS and GRAVE, as they improve the permutation statistics and the AMAF
statistics. We also provide a mathematical derivation of the formulas used for
weighting the three sources of statistics. These formulas are an improvement on
the GRAVE formula since they no longer use the bias hyperparameter of GRAVE.
Moreover, MCPS is not sensitive to the ref hyperparameter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着非欧几里得基础模型在弯曲空间（如双曲几何）中部署表示，需要理解这些几何特性可能引入的安全漏洞，特别是后门攻击的潜在风险。

Method: 通过理论分析形式化了边界驱动的不对称效应，提出了一种简单的几何自适应触发器，并在不同任务和架构上进行了评估。

Result: 实证研究表明，攻击成功率向边界方向增加，而传统检测器的效果减弱，这与理论趋势一致。

Conclusion: 这些结果揭示了非欧几里得模型中特定于几何的脆弱性，并为设计和理解防御方法的局限性提供了基于分析的指导。

Abstract: Non-Euclidean foundation models increasingly place representations in curved
spaces such as hyperbolic geometry. We show that this geometry creates a
boundary-driven asymmetry that backdoor triggers can exploit. Near the
boundary, small input changes appear subtle to standard input-space detectors
but produce disproportionately large shifts in the model's representation
space. Our analysis formalizes this effect and also reveals a limitation for
defenses: methods that act by pulling points inward along the radius can
suppress such triggers, but only by sacrificing useful model sensitivity in
that same direction. Building on these insights, we propose a simple
geometry-adaptive trigger and evaluate it across tasks and architectures.
Empirically, attack success increases toward the boundary, whereas conventional
detectors weaken, mirroring the theoretical trends. Together, these results
surface a geometry-specific vulnerability in non-Euclidean models and offer
analysis-backed guidance for designing and understanding the limits of
defenses.

We explore strategies for designing such portfolios and find that collections
of specialist models consistently outperform portfolios of independently

is a compute-effective approach for creating sufficiently diverse specialists,
and provide evidences that ensembling and model selection are more
compute-efficient than test-time fine-tuning.

Method: 采用Hellinger定位框架，首先在路径测度级别通过降维到i.i.d.学习来控制平方Hellinger距离，然后在参数空间中以轨迹Fisher信息加权的二次形式进行定位。

Result: 该方法在四个案例研究中都实现了接近渐近正态性的实例最优率：简单马尔可夫链混合、非高斯噪声下的依赖线性回归、非单调激活的广义线性模型、以及线性注意力序列模型。

Conclusion: Hellinger定位框架显著扩展了多轨迹设置中实例最优率的适用范围，相比标准降维方法有实质性改进，为更广泛的时间相关数据学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Learning from temporally-correlated data is a core facet of modern machine
learning. Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,
particularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many
independent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important
regime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation
models, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing
assumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal
bounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;
for more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable
guarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective
sample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing
single-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective
sample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.
  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in
multi-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general
approach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first
controlling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a
reduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in
parameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields
instance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set
of conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a
simple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian
noise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and
linear-attention sequence models. In all cases, our bounds nearly match the
instance-optimal rates from asymptotic normality, substantially improving over
standard reductions.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning is a challenging problem especially when the system
itself involves uncertainty. Due to noisy function evaluations, optimization
under uncertainty can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
novel Bayesian optimization framework tailored for hyperparameter tuning under
uncertainty, with a focus on optimizing a scale- or precision-type parameter in
stochastic models. The proposed method employs a statistical surrogate for the
underlying random variable, enabling analytical evaluation of the expectation
operator. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimizer of the
random acquisition function, which significantly reduces computational cost per
iteration. Compared with a conventional one-dimensional Monte Carlo-based
optimization scheme, the proposed approach requires 40 times fewer data points,
resulting in up to a 40-fold reduction in computational cost. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method through two numerical examples in
computational engineering.

Abstract: In decentralized learning networks, predictions from many participants are
combined to generate a network inference. While many studies have demonstrated
performance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing
strategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to
dynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations
that rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.
Due to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving
averages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing
circumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that
uses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at
each epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning
higher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We
show that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning
network, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the
accuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that
predict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret
z-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than
models predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network
inference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series
of optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model
can be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.
These properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each
domain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using
performance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any
situation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed.

Abstract: Transferability estimation metrics are used to find a high-performing
pre-trained model for a given target task without fine-tuning models and
without access to the source dataset. Despite the growing interest in
developing such metrics, the benchmarks used to measure their progress have
gone largely unexamined. In this work, we empirically show the shortcomings of
widely used benchmark setups to evaluate transferability estimation metrics. We
argue that the benchmarks on which these metrics are evaluated are
fundamentally flawed. We empirically demonstrate that their unrealistic model
spaces and static performance hierarchies artificially inflate the perceived
performance of existing metrics, to the point where simple, dataset-agnostic
heuristics can outperform sophisticated methods. Our analysis reveals a
critical disconnect between current evaluation protocols and the complexities
of real-world model selection. To address this, we provide concrete
recommendations for constructing more robust and realistic benchmarks to guide
future research in a more meaningful direction.

Abstract: Attention sinks and compression valleys have attracted significant attention
as two puzzling phenomena in large language models, but have been studied in
isolation. In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention
sinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive
activations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive
activations necessarily produce representational compression and establish
bounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several
models (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence
token develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression
valleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies
validate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose
the Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain
how LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and
representational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit
that Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad
mixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in
the middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers. Our
framework helps explain why embedding tasks perform best at intermediate
layers, whereas generation tasks benefit from full-depth processing, clarifying
differences in task-dependent representations.

*Sanjeda Akter,Ibne Farabi Shihab,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential-EDFL是一种基于经验动态形式提升的序列测试方法，用于语言模型生成停止控制，通过跟踪信息提升并提供形式化的错误控制，在六个基准测试中减少22-28%的生成量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型生成过程中何时停止的问题，通过形式化的统计测试方法提供任何时间有效的错误控制，减少不必要的生成计算。

Method: 使用自归一化经验伯努利e-过程跟踪信息提升（完整模型与弱化骨架基线的对数似然比），处理未知中心化问题，通过混合e-过程组合多个参数，支持分布漂移下的自适应重置。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，Sequential-EDFL相比序列基线减少22-28%的生成量，同时保持delta级控制，计算开销为12%。与轻量级正确性门控组合可提高最终任务正确性。

Conclusion: EDFL作为第一阶段过滤器可减少83%的验证负担，但不能作为安全关键领域的独立解决方案，10.9%的停止序列即使有门控仍不正确。

Abstract: We introduce Sequential-EDFL (Empirical Dynamic Formal Lift), applying
anytime-valid sequential testing to language model generation stopping. Our
approach tracks information lift -- the log-likelihood ratio between full
models and deliberately weakened "skeleton" baselines -- using self-normalized
empirical-Bernstein e-processes that provide formal delta-level error control
regardless of stopping time. We handle unknown centering through online mean
estimation, combine multiple parameters via mixture e-processes, and support
adaptive resets under distributional drift. On six benchmarks, Sequential-EDFL
reduces generation by 22-28% vs. sequential baselines while maintaining
delta-level control with 12% computational overhead. We introduce automated
skeletons (distilled submodels, randomized logits) and show robustness across
skeleton families. Composing EDFL with a lightweight correctness gate (sentence
boundaries + verifier) improves end-task correctness while preserving
anytime-valid guarantees by only delaying stopping. Our certificates control
information sufficiency, not factual correctness -- 10.9% of stopped sequences
remain incorrect even with the gate (13.2-22.7% without it). EDFL serves as a
first-stage filter reducing verification burden by 83%, not as a standalone
solution for safety-critical domains.

*Khoa Trinh,Gaurav Menghani,Erik Vee*

TL;DR: GUIDE是一种新的蒸馏技术，通过让学生在参数空间中匹配教师模型，显著减少了师生质量差距，且不增加训练或推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准蒸馏方法仅让学生匹配教师输出，但训练大模型成本高昂，应该从教师模型中提取更多有用信息。

Method: 提出GUIDE方法，通过引导初始化和嵌入蒸馏，强制学生在参数空间中匹配教师模型。

Result: 使用GUIDE在大型学生模型上显示25-26%的师生质量差距减少，与知识蒸馏结合可获得近乎加性改进，单独应用效果优于单独知识蒸馏。

Conclusion: GUIDE在不增加训练或推理开销的情况下获得模型质量提升，这些改进几乎是免费的。

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency techniques such as distillation
(\cite{hinton2015distillation}) are useful in improving model quality without
increasing serving costs, provided a larger teacher model is available for a
smaller student model to learn from during training. Standard distillation
methods are limited to only forcing the student to match the teacher's outputs.
Given the costs associated with training a large model, we believe we should be
extracting more useful information from a teacher model than by just making the
student match the teacher's outputs.
  In this paper, we introduce \guide (Guided Initialization and Distillation of
Embeddings). \guide can be considered a distillation technique that forces the
student to match the teacher in the parameter space. Using \guide we show
25-26\% reduction in the teacher-student quality gap when using large student
models (400M - 1B parameters) trained on $\approx$ 20B tokens. We also present
a thorough analysis demonstrating that \guide can be combined with knowledge
distillation with near additive improvements. Furthermore, we show that
applying \guide alone leads to substantially better model quality than applying
knowledge distillation by itself.
  Most importantly, \guide introduces no training or inference overhead and
hence any model quality gains from our method are virtually free.

TL;DR: ATLO-ML是一个自适应时间长度优化系统，能自动确定基于用户定义输出时间长度的最优输入时间长度和采样率，提升时间序列预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的时间序列预测严重依赖于合适的输入时间长度和采样率选择，现有方法通常使用固定参数，无法适应不同场景需求。

Method: 开发自适应时间长度优化系统ATLO-ML，动态调整输入时间长度和采样率参数，使用空气质量数据集进行验证。

Result: 使用优化后的时间长度和采样率显著提高了机器学习模型的准确性，相比固定时间长度有显著改进。

Conclusion: ATLO-ML在时间敏感应用中具有泛化潜力，为机器学习工作流中的时间参数优化提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate time-series predictions in machine learning are heavily influenced
by the selection of appropriate input time length and sampling rate. This paper
introduces ATLO-ML, an adaptive time-length optimization system that
automatically determines the optimal input time length and sampling rate based
on user-defined output time length. The system provides a flexible approach to
time-series data pre-processing, dynamically adjusting these parameters to
enhance predictive performance. ATLO-ML is validated using air quality
datasets, including both GAMS-dataset and proprietary data collected from a
data center, both in time series format. Results demonstrate that utilizing the
optimized time length and sampling rate significantly improves the accuracy of
machine learning models compared to fixed time lengths. ATLO-ML shows potential
for generalization across various time-sensitive applications, offering a
robust solution for optimizing temporal input parameters in machine learning
workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了Medix框架，利用中位数操作从未标记数据中识别潜在异常值，然后结合标记的InD数据训练鲁棒的OOD分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中未标记数据通常混合了InD和OOD样本，缺乏明确的OOD样本集使得训练最优OOD分类器变得困难。

Method: 使用中位数操作从未标记数据中识别潜在异常值，因其对噪声和异常值具有鲁棒性，然后利用这些识别出的异常值和标记InD数据训练OOD分类器。

Result: 理论分析显示Medix实现了低错误率，实证结果在开放世界设置中全面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Medix框架通过中位数操作有效识别异常值，在理论和实证上都验证了其在OOD检测中的优越性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the
robustness and reliability of machine learning systems deployed in real-world
applications. Recent approaches have explored the use of unlabeled data,
showing potential for enhancing OOD detection capabilities. However,
effectively utilizing unlabeled in-the-wild data remains challenging due to the
mixed nature of both in-distribution (InD) and OOD samples. The lack of a
distinct set of OOD samples complicates the task of training an optimal OOD
classifier. In this work, we introduce Medix, a novel framework designed to
identify potential outliers from unlabeled data using the median operation. We
use the median because it provides a stable estimate of the central tendency,
as an OOD detection mechanism, due to its robustness against noise and
outliers. Using these identified outliers, along with labeled InD data, we
train a robust OOD classifier. From a theoretical perspective, we derive error
bounds that demonstrate Medix achieves a low error rate. Empirical results
further substantiate our claims, as Medix outperforms existing methods across
the board in open-world settings, confirming the validity of our theoretical
insights.

TL;DR: 文本到图像排行榜存在严重的模型去匿名化漏洞，通过CLIP嵌入空间的简单分类就能高精度识别生成模型，使得排名操纵比之前认为的更容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI排行榜容易受到操纵攻击，其中排名操纵需要首先对展示输出的模型进行去匿名化。虽然这在大型语言模型中已被证明存在威胁，但文本到图像排行榜的问题可能更为严重。

Method: 使用150,000多张生成图像、280个提示词和19个多样化模型，在CLIP嵌入空间中进行实时分类，无需提示控制或历史数据。引入提示级可分离性指标识别能实现近乎完美去匿名化的提示词。

Result: 简单的CLIP嵌入空间分类就能高精度识别生成模型，某些提示词能实现近乎完美的去匿名化效果。

Conclusion: 文本到图像排行榜中的排名操纵比之前认识到的更容易，强调了需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Generative AI leaderboards are central to evaluating model capabilities, but
remain vulnerable to manipulation. Among key adversarial objectives is rank
manipulation, where an attacker must first deanonymize the models behind
displayed outputs -- a threat previously demonstrated and explored for large
language models (LLMs). We show that this problem can be even more severe for
text-to-image leaderboards, where deanonymization is markedly easier. Using
over 150,000 generated images from 280 prompts and 19 diverse models spanning
multiple organizations, architectures, and sizes, we demonstrate that simple
real-time classification in CLIP embedding space identifies the generating
model with high accuracy, even without prompt control or historical data. We
further introduce a prompt-level separability metric and identify prompts that
enable near-perfect deanonymization. Our results indicate that rank
manipulation in text-to-image leaderboards is easier than previously
recognized, underscoring the need for stronger defenses.

Motivation: 研究神经网络输出的独立性，以验证Alignment Research Center提出的计算无巧合猜想，该猜想旨在衡量AI可解释性的极限。

Method: 分析随机初始化神经网络在宽度较大且激活函数满足高斯测度下零均值条件时的输出独立性。

Result: 当激活函数满足$\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$时，神经网络输出近似独立。这包括ReLU和GeLU的加性平移版本、tanh等，但不包括原始ReLU或GeLU。

Conclusion: 具有零均值激活函数的神经网络是验证计算无巧合猜想的有力候选者，其输出独立性为AI可解释性研究提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We establish that randomly initialized neural networks, with large width and
a natural choice of hyperparameters, have nearly independent outputs exactly
when their activation function is nonlinear with zero mean under the Gaussian
measure: $\mathbb{E}_{z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)}[\sigma(z)]=0$. For example, this
includes ReLU and GeLU with an additive shift, as well as tanh, but not ReLU or
GeLU by themselves. Because of their nearly independent outputs, we propose
neural networks with zero-mean activation functions as a promising candidate
for the Alignment Research Center's computational no-coincidence conjecture --
a conjecture that aims to measure the limits of AI interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: POMDP中信念状态的连续性给学习最优策略带来计算挑战，需要找到有效的近似方法。

Method: 将POMDP近似为有限状态MDP（Superstate MDP），使用线性函数逼近的基于策略的学习方法，结合TD学习和策略优化。

Result: 证明了Superstate MDP最优值函数与原始POMDP最优值函数的关系，近似误差随历史长度指数级下降，提供了首个量化非马尔可夫环境下TD学习误差的有限时间界限。

Conclusion: POMDP可以通过转化为MDP并应用标准TD学习来近似求解，该方法具有理论保证和可量化的性能界限。

Abstract: The continuous nature of belief states in POMDPs presents significant
computational challenges in learning the optimal policy. In this paper, we
consider an approach that solves a Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning
(PORL) problem by approximating the corresponding POMDP model into a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) (called Superstate MDP). We first
derive theoretical guarantees that improve upon prior work that relate the
optimal value function of the transformed Superstate MDP to the optimal value
function of the original POMDP. Next, we propose a policy-based learning
approach with linear function approximation to learn the optimal policy for the
Superstate MDP. Consequently, our approach shows that a POMDP can be
approximately solved using TD-learning followed by Policy Optimization by
treating it as an MDP, where the MDP state corresponds to a finite history. We
show that the approximation error decreases exponentially with the length of
this history. To the best of our knowledge, our finite-time bounds are the
first to explicitly quantify the error introduced when applying standard TD
learning to a setting where the true dynamics are not Markovian.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习策略中由自回归模型简单目标条件化引起的不连贯性结构问题，探索通过在线RL微调离线学习策略来改善这一问题的理论基础。

Method: 通过重新构建控制即推理和软Q学习的标准概念，建立三重对应关系：将后验折叠到奖励中，在确定性情况下降低温度参数，并通过软条件生成模型分析不连贯性与有效视野的联系。

Result: 证明了在线RL微调离线学习策略可以减少不连贯性并提高回报，建立了训练-推理权衡的计算内容对应关系。

Conclusion: 通过数学分析揭示了不连贯性问题的本质，建立了迭代重训练过程的多种理解方式之间的对应关系，为改进强化学习策略提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We investigate mathematically the notion of incoherence: a structural issue
with reinforcement learning policies derived by naive goal-conditioning of
autoregressive models. We focus on the process of re-training models on their
own actions, that is, fine-tuning offline-learned policies with online RL. We
prove that it decreases incoherence and leads to an improvement in return, and
we aim to characterize the resulting trajectory of policies. By re-framing
standard notions of control-as-inference and soft Q learning, we establish a
three-way correspondence with two other ways of understanding the iterative
re-training process: as folding the posterior into the reward and, in the
deterministic case, as decreasing the temperature parameter; the correspondence
has computational content via the training-inference trade-off. Through
soft-conditioning generative models, we discuss the link between incoherence
and the effective horizon.

TL;DR: 提出Markovian Thinking范式，通过固定大小的状态推进推理，将思考长度与上下文大小解耦，实现线性计算和恒定内存。Delethink环境将推理结构化为固定大小的块，在块边界重置上下文并通过RL学习无缝继续推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RL推理环境中，状态随推理令牌增加而无限增长，导致注意力策略需要二次计算。需要重新设计思考环境来解决计算开销问题。

Method: 提出Markovian Thinking范式，使用Delethink RL环境将推理分为固定大小的块。在每个块内正常思考，在边界重置上下文并用简短携带信息重新初始化提示。通过RL学习在每个块末尾写入足够的文本状态以实现无缝推理继续。

Result: 1.5B模型在8K令牌块中推理，但思考长度可达24K令牌，性能匹配或超过使用24K预算的LongCoT-RL。在测试时扩展中，Delethink持续改进而LongCoT趋于稳定。在96K平均思考长度下，LongCoT-RL成本为27 H100月，而Delethink仅为7 H100月。

Conclusion: 重新设计思考环境是强大杠杆：无需二次开销即可实现超长推理，为高效、可扩展的推理LLM开辟了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training
reasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard
RL "thinking environment", where the state is the prompt plus all prior
reasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies
to pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment
itself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances
reasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking
length from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear
compute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL
environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each
chunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the
context and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the
policy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient
for seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this
environment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up
to 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.
With test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.
The effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K
average thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.
Analysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)
often sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing
positive samples that make RL effective at scale. Our results show that
redesigning the thinking environment is a powerful lever: it enables very long
reasoning without quadratic overhead and opens a path toward efficient,
scalable reasoning LLMs.

Method: 比较两种AI框架与纯人工评估，通过注入从随机猜测到简单预测的劣质模型来压力测试，使用基于脊柱X光图像的随机对照试验数据进行评估。

Result: AI作为辅助读者（AI-SR）方法在所有标准下表现最佳，即使在劣质模型情况下也能提供可靠的疾病估计，保持临床试验治疗效果估计和结论的有效性。

Conclusion: AI-SR是临床试验中最合适的AI部署方法，能够确保治疗效果的可靠性并在不同人群中保持优势。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical
trials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response
prediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,
particularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial
conclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for
medical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,
and generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad
models, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that
observed treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We
evaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints
derived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a
supporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as
it meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This
method consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical
trial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages
when applied to different populations.

TL;DR: 提出DPA-Net双路径注意力神经网络，从稀疏的SMBG数据直接估计AGP血糖指标，解决CGM成本高、可及性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CGM设备成本高且可及性有限，特别是在中低收入地区难以普及，而SMBG虽然便宜且广泛可用，但数据稀疏不规则，难以转换为有临床意义的血糖指标。

Method: DPA-Net包含两个互补路径：空间通道注意力路径重建CGM样轨迹，多尺度ResNet路径直接预测AGP指标；引入对齐机制减少偏差和过拟合；开发主动点选择器识别反映患者行为模式的SMBG采样点。

Result: 在大型真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，DPA-Net实现了稳健的精度和低误差，同时减少了系统偏差。

Conclusion: 这是首个从SMBG数据估计AGP指标的监督机器学习框架，为无法使用CGM的场景提供了实用且临床相关的决策支持工具。

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose
profiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)
metrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above
Range (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict
its widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In
contrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely
available but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to
translate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.
  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to
estimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two
complementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a
CGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet
path that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two
paths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we
develop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG
sampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.
  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net
achieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework
for estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically
relevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.

Motivation: 现有微调方法往往在性能提升的同时引入噪声，需要一种简单有效的方法来优化微调后的模型权重，而不需要额外的训练数据或计算开销。

Conclusion: POME是一个实用、零成本的增强方法，广泛适用于任何微调流程，无需修改训练管道或增加开销。

Abstract: We introduce Post-Optimization Model Edit (POME), a new algorithm that
enhances the performance of fine-tuned large language models using only their
pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints, without requiring extra data or further
optimization. The core idea is to apply a muon-style projection to $\Delta W$,
the difference between the fine-tuned and pretrained weights. This projection
uses truncated singular value decomposition (SVD) to equalize the influence of
dominant update directions and prune small singular values, which often
represent noise. As a simple post-processing step, POME is completely decoupled
from the training pipeline. It requires zero modifications and imposes no
overhead, making it universally compatible with any optimizer or distributed
framework. POME delivers consistent gains, boosting average performance by
+2.5\% on GSM8K and +1.0\% on code generation. Its broad applicability -- from
7B foundation models to 72B RLHF-instructed models -- establishes it as a
practical, zero-cost enhancement for any fine-tuning pipeline. Code is
available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/POME.

Abstract: Underground water and wastewater pipelines are vital for city operations but
plagued by anomalies like leaks and infiltrations, causing substantial water
loss, environmental damage, and high repair costs. Conventional manual
inspections lack efficiency, while dense sensor deployments are prohibitively
expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly and is
increasingly applied to urban infrastructure. In this research, we propose an
integrated AI and remote-sensor framework to address the challenge of leak
detection in underground water pipelines, through deploying a sparse set of
remote sensors to capture real-time flow and depth data, paired with HydroNet -
a dedicated model utilizing pipeline attributes (e.g., material, diameter,
slope) in a directed graph for higher-precision modeling. Evaluations on a
real-world campus wastewater network dataset demonstrate that our system
collects effective spatio-temporal hydraulic data, enabling HydroNet to
outperform advanced baselines. This integration of edge-aware message passing
with hydraulic simulations enables accurate network-wide predictions from
limited sensor deployments. We envision that this approach can be effectively
extended to a wide range of underground water pipeline networks.

Motivation: 传统的α-散度NMF方法在多层架构中难以保证收敛，需要从新的理论角度分析其收敛行为。

Method: 受化学反应中能量势垒的玻尔兹曼概率启发，提出Chem-NMF方法，引入边界因子来稳定收敛，首次从物理化学视角严格分析NMF算法的收敛行为。

Conclusion: Chem-NMF方法有效解决了多层NMF的收敛问题，显著提升了聚类性能，为NMF收敛分析提供了新的物理化学视角。

Abstract: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning method
offering low-rank representations across various domains such as audio
processing, biomedical signal analysis, and image recognition. The
incorporation of $\alpha$-divergence in NMF formulations enhances flexibility
in optimization, yet extending these methods to multi-layer architectures
presents challenges in ensuring convergence. To address this, we introduce a
novel approach inspired by the Boltzmann probability of the energy barriers in
chemical reactions to theoretically perform convergence analysis. We introduce
a novel method, called Chem-NMF, with a bounding factor which stabilizes
convergence. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a physical
chemistry perspective to rigorously analyze the convergence behaviour of the
NMF algorithm. We start from mathematically proven asymptotic convergence
results and then show how they apply to real data. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves clustering accuracy by 5.6%
$\pm$ 2.7% on biomedical signals and 11.1% $\pm$ 7.2% on face images (mean

*Shiye Su,Yuhui Zhang,Linqi Zhou,Rajesh Ranganath,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的流匹配方法，通过在训练过程中向源样本和流插值注入随机性，解决了分布到分布转换中监督稀疏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配主要关注噪声到数据的转换，但在分布到分布的转换场景中，当源分布也是从有限样本中学习时，标准流匹配会因监督稀疏而失败。

Method: 通过在训练过程中扰动源样本和流插值来注入随机性，这是一种简单且计算高效的方法。

Result: 在五个不同的成像任务中，该方法显著提高了生成质量，平均比现有基线高出9个FID点，并降低了输入和生成样本之间的传输成本。

Conclusion: 该方法使流匹配成为模拟科学中出现的各种分布转换的更实用工具。

Abstract: Modeling transformations between arbitrary data distributions is a
fundamental scientific challenge, arising in applications like drug discovery
and evolutionary simulation. While flow matching offers a natural framework for
this task, its use has thus far primarily focused on the noise-to-data setting,
while its application in the general distribution-to-distribution setting is
underexplored. We find that in the latter case, where the source is also a data
distribution to be learned from limited samples, standard flow matching fails
due to sparse supervision. To address this, we propose a simple and
computationally efficient method that injects stochasticity into the training
process by perturbing source samples and flow interpolants. On five diverse
imaging tasks spanning biology, radiology, and astronomy, our method
significantly improves generation quality, outperforming existing baselines by
an average of 9 FID points. Our approach also reduces the transport cost
between input and generated samples to better highlight the true effect of the
transformation, making flow matching a more practical tool for simulating the
diverse distribution transformations that arise in science.

*Yunpeng Gong,Sihan Lan,Can Yang,Kunpeng Xu,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了StruSR框架，利用训练好的物理信息神经网络从时间序列数据中提取局部结构化物理先验，通过遗传编程进行符号回归，提高收敛速度和表达式可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统符号回归方法缺乏从时间序列观测中提取结构化物理先验的机制，难以捕捉反映系统全局行为的符号表达式。

Method: 使用训练好的PINN进行局部泰勒展开获取导数结构信息，引入基于掩码的归因机制量化子树贡献度，通过混合适应度函数联合最小化物理残差和泰勒系数失配。

Result: 在基准PDE系统上的实验表明，StruSR相比传统基线提高了收敛速度、结构保真度和表达式可解释性。

Conclusion: StruSR为基于物理的符号发现提供了一个有原则的范式，能够更好地捕捉系统的全局行为。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by
searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system
behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.
However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical
priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic
expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose
a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages
trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured
physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on
the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural
information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of
expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that
quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical
residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover
operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high
physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less
informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics
residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the
governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.
Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves
convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability
compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for
physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在测试时缩放和微调方面取得进展，但自回归扩散模型中的引导机制研究不足，特别是在数据同化这一计算昂贵且容易产生预测漂移的领域。

Method: 使用离线训练的轻量级控制器网络，通过预览未来AR扩散模型展开并学习逐步控制，在终端成本目标下预测即将到来的观测值。

Result: 在两个典型偏微分方程和六种观测机制下，该方法在稳定性、准确性和物理保真度方面持续优于四种最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法将数据同化推理简化为单次前向展开，避免了昂贵的伴随计算和优化，在混沌时空偏微分方程的数据同化中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion
models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains
underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained
ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing
future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming
observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the
context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial
differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often
computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse
observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout
with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or
optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and
physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We
will release code and checkpoints publicly.

TL;DR: 论文评估了机器学习算子(MLOs)在零样本超分辨率任务中的表现，发现其无法实现多分辨率推理，存在混叠问题，并提出了一种简单的多分辨率训练协议来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习中的核心挑战是建模连续现象，MLOs被引入以实现任意分辨率的推理。本研究旨在评估MLOs是否能够实现零样本超分辨率，即在比训练时更高分辨率的数据上进行推理。

Method: 将多分辨率推理分解为两个关键行为：1)对不同频率信息的推断；2)在不同分辨率间的插值。通过实证评估MLOs在这两个任务上的表现，并提出了一种计算效率高、数据驱动的多分辨率训练协议。

Result: 实证结果表明MLOs无法以零样本方式完成这两个任务，无法在不同分辨率下进行准确推理，反而表现出脆弱性且容易受到混叠影响。提出的多分辨率训练协议能够克服混叠问题并提供稳健的多分辨率泛化能力。

Conclusion: MLOs本身无法实现零样本多分辨率推理，但通过提出的多分辨率训练协议可以解决其局限性，实现稳健的多分辨率泛化。

Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing
more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are
represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced
as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can
perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether
this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot
super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on
higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We
comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution
(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution
inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency
information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically
demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.
Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at
resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they
are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we
propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution
training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust
multi-resolution generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前向-前向算法目前主要局限于监督学习，而强化学习领域更自然地提供学习信号，因此需要将其扩展到RL领域。

Method: 引入动作条件均方根Q函数(ARQ)，结合FF算法的goodness函数和动作条件，使用时间差分学习进行局部强化学习。

Result: 在MinAtar和DeepMind Control Suite基准测试中，ARQ优于最先进的局部无反向传播RL方法，并在大多数任务中超越使用反向传播的算法。

Conclusion: ARQ方法简单且具有生物学基础，在强化学习中表现出色，证明了前向-前向算法在RL领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) Algorithm is a recently proposed learning procedure
for neural networks that employs two forward passes instead of the traditional
forward and backward passes used in backpropagation. However, FF remains
largely confined to supervised settings, leaving a gap at domains where
learning signals can be yielded more naturally such as RL. In this work,
inspired by FF's goodness function using layer activity statistics, we
introduce Action-conditioned Root mean squared Q-Functions (ARQ), a novel value
estimation method that applies a goodness function and action conditioning for
local RL using temporal difference learning. Despite its simplicity and
biological grounding, our approach achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art local backprop-free RL methods in the MinAtar and the DeepMind
Control Suite benchmarks, while also outperforming algorithms trained with
backpropagation on most tasks. Code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络(MLP、CNN、Transformer等)的非线性能力受限于激活函数选择，需要更强大的非线性模块来提升模型表达能力

Method: 基于高斯混合模型和距离特性，放松概率约束并采用灵活的高斯投影参数化，构建可微分模块，可端到端训练并集成到各种神经网络架构中

Result: 在MLP、CNN、注意力机制和LSTM等架构中集成GMNM后，性能均优于标准基线模型

Conclusion: GMNM是一种强大灵活的非线性模块，能够有效提升各种机器学习应用的效率和准确性

Abstract: Neural networks in general, from MLPs and CNNs to attention-based
Transformers, are constructed from layers of linear combinations followed by
nonlinear operations such as ReLU, Sigmoid, or Softmax. Despite their strength,
these conventional designs are often limited in introducing non-linearity by
the choice of activation functions. In this work, we introduce Gaussian
Mixture-Inspired Nonlinear Modules (GMNM), a new class of differentiable
modules that draw on the universal density approximation Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) and distance properties (metric space) of Gaussian kernal. By
relaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of
Gaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural
architectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as
MLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance
over standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful
and flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range
of machine learning applications.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer已成为序列建模的主流架构，但其结构参数如何影响表达能力仍缺乏深入理解，特别是注意力头数量的作用。

Method: 引入广义D-检索任务作为理论框架，分析Transformer在ε-逼近中的参数复杂度上下界，并验证单头和多头情况下的表达能力。

Result: 证明了多头Transformer可实现高效逼近，而头数过少时参数复杂度至少为O(1/ε^{cT})；单头情况下需要O(T)维嵌入才能完全记忆输入。

Conclusion: 注意力头数量对Transformer的表达能力至关重要，多头设计能显著降低逼近复杂度，这一发现在理论和实验中均得到验证。

Abstract: Transformer has become the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, yet a
detailed understanding of how its structural parameters influence expressive
power remains limited. In this work, we study the approximation properties of
transformers, with particular emphasis on the role of the number of attention
heads. Our analysis begins with the introduction of a generalized $D$-retrieval
task, which we prove to be dense in the space of continuous functions, thereby
providing the basis for our theoretical framework. We then establish both upper
and lower bounds on the parameter complexity required for
$\epsilon$-approximation. Specifically, we show that transformers with
sufficiently many heads admit efficient approximation, whereas with too few
heads, the number of parameters must scale at least as $O(1/\epsilon^{cT})$,
for some constant $c$ and sequence length $T$. To the best of our knowledge,
this constitutes the first rigorous lower bound of this type in a nonlinear and
practically relevant setting. We further examine the single-head case and
demonstrate that an embedding dimension of order $O(T)$ allows complete
memorization of the input, where approximation is entirely achieved by the
feed-forward block. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with
experiments on both synthetic data and real-world tasks, illustrating the
practical relevance of our results.

TL;DR: XRPO是一个基于探索-利用原则的强化学习框架，通过自适应rollout分配和优势函数优化，在数学和编程任务上显著提升了LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO等强化学习方法在LLM推理中存在探索不足和反馈信号利用不充分的问题，主要由于跨提示的固定rollout分配和过度依赖稀疏奖励。

Method: 提出了XRPO框架：1）数学基础的rollout分配器，优先处理不确定性高的提示；2）上下文种子策略，引导模型处理困难推理轨迹；3）基于组相对和新颖性的优势函数锐化机制。

Result: 在多个数学和编程基准测试中，XRPO比GRPO和GSPO等方法在pass@1指标上提升高达4%，在cons@32指标上提升高达6%，训练收敛速度提升2.7倍。

Conclusion: XRPO通过探索-利用的统一框架有效解决了LLM推理中的探索不足和稀疏奖励问题，显著提升了推理性能并加速了训练收敛。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms such as GRPO have driven recent advances in
large language model (LLM) reasoning. While scaling the number of rollouts
stabilizes training, existing approaches suffer from limited exploration on
challenging prompts and leave informative feedback signals underexploited, due
to context-independent rollout allocation across prompts (e.g., generating 16
rollouts per prompt) and relying heavily on sparse rewards. This paper presents
XRPO(eXplore - eXploit GRPO), a unified framework that recasts policy
optimization through the principled lens of rollout exploration-exploitation.
To enhance exploration, XRPO introduces a mathematically grounded rollout
allocator that adaptively prioritizes prompts with higher potential for
uncertainty reduction. It further addresses stagnation on zero-reward prompts
through an in-context seeding strategy that injects curated exemplars, steering
the model into more difficult reasoning trajectories. To strengthen
exploitation, XRPO develops a group-relative, novelty-aware advantage
sharpening mechanism that leverages sequence likelihoods to amplify
low-probability yet correct responses, thereby extending the policy's reach
beyond sparse rewards. Experiments across diverse math and coding benchmarks on
both reasoning and non-reasoning models demonstrate that XRPO outperforms
existing advances (e.g., GRPO and GSPO) up to 4% pass@1 and 6% cons@32, while
accelerating training convergence by up to 2.7X.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，主要因为未能充分考虑文本和时间序列模态的差异，特别是时间序列的单向影响和随时间衰减的特性。

Method: 提出TimeFormer架构，核心是带两个调制项的自注意力机制（MoSA），基于Hawkes过程和因果掩码约束来捕捉时间先验；同时引入多尺度和子序列分析框架来捕获不同时间尺度的语义依赖。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，TimeFormer显著优于现有最优方法，MSE最多降低7.45%，在94.04%的评估指标上创造了新记录；MoSA机制还能泛化提升其他Transformer模型的性能。

Conclusion: TimeFormer通过专门设计的时间序列感知注意力机制，有效解决了Transformer在时间序列预测中的局限性，为时间序列建模提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Transformers excel in natural language processing, their extension
to time series forecasting remains challenging due to insufficient
consideration of the differences between textual and temporal modalities. In
this paper, we develop a novel Transformer architecture designed for time
series data, aiming to maximize its representational capacity. We identify two
key but often overlooked characteristics of time series: (1) unidirectional
influence from the past to the future, and (2) the phenomenon of decaying
influence over time. These characteristics are introduced to enhance the
attention mechanism of Transformers. We propose TimeFormer, whose core
innovation is a self-attention mechanism with two modulation terms (MoSA),
designed to capture these temporal priors of time series under the constraints
of the Hawkes process and causal masking. Additionally, TimeFormer introduces a
framework based on multi-scale and subsequence analysis to capture semantic
dependencies at different temporal scales, enriching the temporal dependencies.
Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that
TimeFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to
a 7.45% reduction in MSE compared to the best baseline and setting new
benchmarks on 94.04\% of evaluation metrics. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
MoSA mechanism can be broadly applied to enhance the performance of other
Transformer-based models.

Motivation: 解决分布式多玩家多臂老虎机问题中玩家间的碰撞问题，在没有中央协调的情况下，仅通过局部观测和碰撞反馈实现高效协作。

Conclusion: 提出的分布式算法在通信效率和遗憾性能上均优于现有方法，并可扩展到异步环境实现对数遗憾。

Abstract: We study the stochastic Multiplayer Multi-Armed Bandit (MMAB) problem, where
multiple players select arms to maximize their cumulative rewards. Collisions
occur when two or more players select the same arm, resulting in no reward, and
are observed by the players involved. We consider a distributed setting without
central coordination, where each player can only observe their own actions and
collision feedback. We propose a distributed algorithm with an adaptive,
efficient communication protocol. The algorithm achieves near-optimal group and
individual regret, with a communication cost of only $\mathcal{O}(\log\log T)$.
Our experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing
baselines. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our approach achieves a
notable reduction in individual regret. Finally, we extend our approach to a
periodic asynchronous setting, proving the lower bound for this problem and
presenting an algorithm that achieves logarithmic regret.

Motivation: 传统PINN训练方法在处理具有冲突目标和不同曲率的多重损失项时存在根本性限制，因为单一优化器处理光谱异质损失景观会破坏其内部预处理机制。

Method: 提出"后组合"训练范式AutoBalance，为每个损失分量分配独立的自适应优化器，在优化后聚合预处理后的更新。

Result: 在具有挑战性的PDE基准测试中，AutoBalance始终优于现有框架，在MSE和L∞范数上显著降低解误差。

Conclusion: AutoBalance是一种有效解决PINN训练平衡问题的新方法，且与其他流行的PINN方法正交互补，能在高要求基准测试中增强其有效性。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a powerful and general
framework for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by embedding
physical laws into loss functions. However, training PINNs is notoriously
difficult due to the need to balance multiple loss terms, such as PDE residuals
and boundary conditions, which often have conflicting objectives and vastly
different curvatures. Existing methods address this issue by manipulating
gradients before optimization (a "pre-combine" strategy). We argue that this
approach is fundamentally limited, as forcing a single optimizer to process
gradients from spectrally heterogeneous loss landscapes disrupts its internal
preconditioning. In this work, we introduce AutoBalance, a novel "post-combine"
training paradigm. AutoBalance assigns an independent adaptive optimizer to
each loss component and aggregates the resulting preconditioned updates
afterwards. Extensive experiments on challenging PDE benchmarks show that
AutoBalance consistently outperforms existing frameworks, achieving significant
reductions in solution error, as measured by both the MSE and $L^{\infty}$
norms. Moreover, AutoBalance is orthogonal to and complementary with other
popular PINN methodologies, amplifying their effectiveness on demanding
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有模型提取攻击在硬标签设置下虽然理论上可行，但随着攻击目标深度增加，所需假设变得不现实，实际需要指数级查询次数，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CrossLayer Extraction攻击方法，不直接提取特定神经元的秘密参数，而是利用跨层神经元交互从更深层提取信息，从而降低查询复杂度。

Result: 新方法显著减少了模型提取所需的查询次数，缓解了现有方法在深度网络中的局限性。

Conclusion: 跨层提取技术为深度神经网络模型提取提供了更实用的解决方案，克服了现有方法在深度增加时的指数成本问题。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have attracted significant attention, and their
internal models are now considered valuable intellectual assets. Extracting
these internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to
extracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,
cryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been
actively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely
deployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)
assume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent
works (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,
where only the final classification result (e.g., "dog" or "car") is available
to the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that
model extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted
setting.
  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack
become increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,
satisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with
respect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in
polynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack
method called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret
parameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs
exponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this
information from deeper layers. This technique significantly reduces query
complexity and mitigates the limitations of existing model extraction
approaches.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理不规则采样和缺失值时效果不佳且计算成本高，而基于扩散的ImagenTime模型虽然强大，但简单掩码会破坏自然邻域关系。

Result: 实现了最先进的性能，判别分数相对提升70%，计算成本降低85%。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了补全和掩码的优势，能够高效生成真实的时间序列数据。

Abstract: Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in
healthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing
values present significant challenges. While prior methods address these
irregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high
computational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as
the diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable
generative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,
making them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular
sequences using simple masking introduces "unnatural" neighborhoods, where
missing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome
this, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer
completes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a
vision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed
values. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,
enabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in
discriminative score by $70\%$ and in computational cost by $85\%$. Code is at

Conclusion: 双目标表示提供了一种理论上有保证且实用的目标表示方法，能够有效提升目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce dual goal representations for goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning (GCRL). A dual goal representation characterizes a state
by "the set of temporal distances from all other states"; in other words, it
encodes a state through its relations to every other state, measured by
temporal distance. This representation provides several appealing theoretical
properties. First, it depends only on the intrinsic dynamics of the environment
and is invariant to the original state representation. Second, it contains
provably sufficient information to recover an optimal goal-reaching policy,
while being able to filter out exogenous noise. Based on this concept, we
develop a practical goal representation learning method that can be combined
with any existing GCRL algorithm. Through diverse experiments on the OGBench
task suite, we empirically show that dual goal representations consistently
improve offline goal-reaching performance across 20 state- and pixel-based
tasks.

Abstract: Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from
domain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly
needed. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single
causal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a
causal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian
experimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure
learning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian
structure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal
Bayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating
elicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed
method successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture
components or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning
performance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated
expert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing
complex distributions in a breast cancer database.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数回归是机器学习的基本应用，但Forward-Forward训练范式目前仅限于分类任务，需要将其扩展到回归问题。

Method: 开发了基于Forward-Forward算法的函数回归方法，并在单变量和多变量函数上进行评估。

Result: 成功实现了使用Forward-Forward算法进行函数回归，并进行了初步的扩展研究。

Conclusion: Forward-Forward算法可以有效地应用于函数回归任务，为无反向传播的神经网络训练开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Function regression/approximation is a fundamental application of machine
learning. Neural networks (NNs) can be easily trained for function regression
using a sufficient number of neurons and epochs. The forward-forward learning
algorithm is a novel approach for training neural networks without
backpropagation, and is well suited for implementation in neuromorphic
computing and physical analogs for neural networks. To the best of the authors'
knowledge, the Forward Forward paradigm of training and inferencing NNs is
currently only restricted to classification tasks. This paper introduces a new
methodology for approximating functions (function regression) using the
Forward-Forward algorithm. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the developed
methodology on univariate and multivariate functions, and provides preliminary
studies of extending the proposed Forward-Forward regression to Kolmogorov
Arnold Networks, and Deep Physical Neural Networks.

TL;DR: 使用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)解决SIR模型逆问题，对德国各联邦州进行细粒度时空分析，估计传播和恢复参数，追踪时变再生数R_t。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行凸显了定量建模的重要性，但传统SIR模型难以直接处理噪声观测数据，需要更有效的方法来分析公共卫生干预措施的效果。

Method: 采用物理信息神经网络(PINNs)方法，利用罗伯特·科赫研究所(RKI)的感染数据，解决SIR模型的逆问题，进行德国各联邦州的时空分析。

Result: 发现不同地区传播行为存在显著差异，与疫苗接种率和主要大流行阶段的时间模式相关，成功估计了州特定的传播和恢复参数以及时变再生数。

Conclusion: 证明了PINNs在局部化、长期流行病学建模中的实用性，能够有效追踪疫情进展并揭示区域差异。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and
analysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc
analyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the
effectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies
and containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR
(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly
incorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the
SIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main
contribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics
across all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate
state-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying
reproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results
highlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing
correlations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with
major pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in
localized, long-term epidemiological modeling.

### [74] [Get RICH or Die Scaling: Profitably Trading Inference Compute for Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06790)
*Tavish McDonald,Bo Lei,Stanislav Fort,Bhavya Kailkhura,Brian Bartoldson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出RICH假设：推理计算防御的效益取决于模型训练数据是否更好地反映了被攻击数据的组成成分。当OOD数据可通过其ID组件理解时，推理计算能增强对防御规范的遵循，从而提高对抗性攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLM推理能提高对防御规范的遵循，从而增强对越狱攻击的鲁棒性，但这种测试计算效益在攻击者获得梯度或多模态输入时会减弱。本文旨在填补这一空白，证明推理计算在这些情况下仍然有效。

Method: 提出RICH假设，通过实验验证在视觉语言模型和不同类型攻击中，如果OOD数据的规范遵循通过组合泛化解锁，测试时计算能带来鲁棒性增益。使用提示增强防御规范强调，分析基础模型鲁棒性与推理计算效益的关联。

Result: 实验表明，通过提示增强防御规范能降低基于梯度的多模态攻击在对抗预训练鲁棒化VLM上的成功率，但对未鲁棒化模型无此效益。推理计算的鲁棒性效益与基础模型鲁棒性相关，形成富者愈富的动态。

Conclusion: 建议将训练时和测试时防御层叠使用以获得协同效益。组合泛化使模型能够通过ID组件理解OOD数据，从而在对抗性OOD输入上遵循防御规范。

Abstract: Models are susceptible to adversarially out-of-distribution (OOD) data
despite large training-compute investments into their robustification. Zaremba
et al. (2025) make progress on this problem at test time, showing LLM reasoning
improves satisfaction of model specifications designed to thwart attacks,
resulting in a correlation between reasoning effort and robustness to
jailbreaks. However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are
given access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying
that inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues
that compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via
its in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive
specifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness
from Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as
the model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We
empirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack
types, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification
following on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL
finetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing
emphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of
gradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial
pretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to
not-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness
benefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:
attacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding
compositional generalization to OOD data. Accordingly, we advise layering
train-time and test-time defenses to obtain their synergistic benefit.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的在线持续图学习方法：使用固定的随机初始化编码器生成节点嵌入，仅在线训练轻量级分类器，无需复杂的内存缓冲或正则化机制。


<details>

Motivation: 解决在线持续图学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，传统方法面临节点逐个到达、分布漂移和无法离线训练的挑战。

Method: 冻结随机初始化的图编码器，仅在线训练轻量级分类器，通过聚合邻域信息生成鲁棒且稳定的节点嵌入。

Result: 在多个OCGL基准测试中，该方法相比最先进方法获得一致提升，最高提升达30%，性能接近离线联合训练的上界。

Conclusion: 在线持续图学习中，通过架构简单性和稳定性可以最小化灾难性遗忘，无需复杂的重放或正则化机制。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the main obstacles for Online Continual
Graph Learning (OCGL), where nodes arrive one by one, distribution drifts may
occur at any time and offline training on task-specific subgraphs is not
feasible. In this work, we explore a surprisingly simple yet highly effective
approach for OCGL: we use a fixed, randomly initialized encoder to generate
robust and expressive node embeddings by aggregating neighborhood information,
training online only a lightweight classifier. By freezing the encoder, we
eliminate drifts of the representation parameters, a key source of forgetting,
obtaining embeddings that are both expressive and stable. When evaluated across
several OCGL benchmarks, despite its simplicity and lack of memory buffer, this
approach yields consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods, with surprising
improvements of up to 30% and performance often approaching that of the joint
offline-training upper bound. These results suggest that in OCGL, catastrophic
forgetting can be minimized without complex replay or regularization by
embracing architectural simplicity and stability.

TL;DR: 论文提出BitTokens，一种将数字编码为单个token的新方法，使用IEEE 754二进制浮点表示，解决了当前LLM处理数值数据时token效率低下的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿LLM需要大量推理token来解决基本计算问题，且其分词策略将单个数字拆分为多个token，限制了模型处理复杂数值问题的能力。

Method: 提出BitTokens分词策略，利用IEEE 754二进制浮点表示将任何数字嵌入到单个token中，满足高效单token数字编码的设计要求。

Result: 实验表明，即使小型语言模型使用BitTokens也能近乎完美地学习解决基本算术运算的算法，显著提升了计算效率。

Conclusion: BitTokens通过提高数值处理的效率，可以扩展语言模型能够解决的问题的长度和复杂度。

Abstract: To drive progress in science and engineering, large language models (LLMs)
must be able to process large amounts of numerical data and solve long
calculations efficiently. This is currently only possible through the use of
external tools or extensive reasoning chains, either limiting the numerical
intuition of LLMs or limiting the length of problems they can solve. We show
that frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even
basic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that
split single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for
efficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of
desiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill
them. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization
strategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary
floating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our
BitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic
arithmetic operations nearly perfectly. This newly gained efficiency could
expand the length and complexity of problems language models can solve.

Motivation: 挑战当前大语言模型中流行的纯注意力机制，指出其无法处理需要长期记忆的智能体任务，特别是在软件工程代理等需要长时间运行的场景中。

Method: 引入循环完备架构，并在GitHub动作序列上进行训练，通过固定参数数量训练不同长度的序列。

Result: 训练损失随序列长度呈幂律分布，且长序列训练的时间成本线性增加但总能获得更低的损失。

Conclusion: 循环机制对于处理长序列智能体任务是必要的，长序列训练在时间成本上是值得的投资。

Abstract: In recent years, attention-like mechanisms have been used to great success in
the space of large language models, unlocking scaling potential to a previously
unthinkable extent. "Attention Is All You Need" famously claims RNN cells are
not needed in conjunction with attention. We challenge this view. In this
paper, we point to existing proofs that architectures with fully parallelizable
forward or backward passes cannot represent classes of problems specifically
interesting for long-running agentic tasks. We further conjecture a critical
time t beyond which non-recurrence-complete models fail to aggregate inputs
correctly, with concrete implications for agentic systems (e.g., software
engineering agents). To address this, we introduce a recurrence-complete
architecture and train it on GitHub-derived action sequences. Loss follows a
power law in the trained sequence length while the parameter count remains
fixed. Moreover, longer-sequence training always amortizes its linearly
increasing wall-time cost, yielding lower loss as a function of wall time.

Abstract: Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and
forms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,
research cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a
diagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study
aims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms
from triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our
proposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on
twosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term
memory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the
classification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.
Thisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few
specific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years
are used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate
forecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results
substantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing
alarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive

Conclusion: 本研究首次实现了FlashAttention的向量化，通过创新的指数函数近似和内存优化策略，在RISC-V向量处理器上成功加速了注意力内核，为相关模型的硬件加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in numerous machine learning and artificial
intelligence models. This work focuses on the acceleration of attention kernel
using FlashAttention algorithm, in vector processors, particularly those based
on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). This work represents the
first effort to vectorize FlashAttention, minimizing scalar code and
simplifying the computational complexity of evaluating exponentials needed by
softmax used in attention. By utilizing a low-cost approximation for
exponentials in floating-point arithmetic, we reduce the cost of computing the
exponential function without the need to extend baseline vector ISA with new
custom instructions. Also, appropriate tiling strategies are explored with the
goal to improve memory locality. Experimental results highlight the scalability
of our approach, demonstrating significant performance gains with the
vectorized implementations when processing attention layers in practical
applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer architectures offer
strengths for modeling temporal data: CNNs excel at capturing local patterns
and translational invariances, while transformers effectively model long-range
dependencies via self-attention. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture
integrating convolutional feature extraction with a temporal fusion transformer
(TFT) backbone to enhance multivariate time series forecasting. The CNN module
first applies a hierarchy of one-dimensional convolutional layers to distill
salient local patterns from raw input sequences, reducing noise and
dimensionality. The resulting feature maps are then fed into the TFT, which
applies multi-head attention to capture both short- and long-term dependencies
and to weigh relevant covariates adaptively. We evaluate the CNN-TFT on a
hydroelectric natural flow time series dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that CNN-TFT outperforms well-established deep learning models,
with a mean absolute percentage error of up to 2.2%. The explainability of the
model is obtained by a proposed Shapley additive explanations with multi-head
attention weights (SHAP-MHAW). Our novel architecture, named CNN-TFT-SHAP-MHAW,
is promising for applications requiring high-fidelity, multivariate time series
forecasts, being available for future analysis at

Result: 随机森林对商业银行数据的预测准确率达到90%，三种机器学习方法都能准确预测农村银行的破产可能性。

Conclusion: 提出的创新机器学习方法有助于实施降低破产成本的政策，为银行风险管理提供更有效的工具。

Abstract: Context: Financial system stability is determined by the condition of the
banking system. A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial
system, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual
banks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the
probability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is
safe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such
as Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a
bankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and
sometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.
New approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are
developed using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),
random forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several
studies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical
methods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present
Research: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial
statements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to
2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports
of 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.
Five rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the
feasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The
results of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from
commercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine
learning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank
bankruptcy. Contribution and Conclusion: The proposed innovative machine
learning approach help to implement policies that reduce the costs of
bankruptcy.

Conclusion: HH-MPNN为实时电力系统操作提供了实用且可推广的机器学习解决方案，实现了跨电网规模的可扩展性和对拓扑变化的适应性。

Abstract: AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale
power systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.
Machine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with
scalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable
scalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose
a Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models
buses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as
distinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for
handling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN
achieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot
to thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap
despite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also
improves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to
10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,
generalizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大推理模型在跨模态推理方面表现出色，但在对抗性或不安全提示下会放大安全风险，这种现象被称为"推理税"。现有防御主要在输出层面，无法约束推理过程，使模型面临隐含风险。

Method: 提出SaFeR-VLM框架，包含四个组件：(I) QI-Safe-10K数据集，强调安全关键和推理敏感案例；(II) 安全感知rollout，不安全生成会经过反思和修正；(III) 结构化奖励建模，具有多维加权标准和明确惩罚；(IV) GRPO优化，强化安全和修正轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架将安全从被动保护转变为推理的主动驱动因素，实现了可扩展和可泛化的安全感知推理，对显性和隐性风险都表现出鲁棒性，支持超越表面过滤的动态和可解释安全决策。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal
reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a
phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at
the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models
exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a
safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly
into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)
QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and
reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations
undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured
reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties
for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which
reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts
safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling
scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further
demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting
dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.
SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and
helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$
larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.
Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass
GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points
respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any
degradation in helpfulness performance. Our codes are available at

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise
constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are
either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with
learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and
real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a
novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using
the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes
pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in
angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering.
SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to
specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid
inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical
guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on
diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights,
confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world
effectiveness. Code is available at

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,
and cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing
multiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for
such problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in
this field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their
deployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge
computing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper
introduces the \textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural
Network-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a
new detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather
than reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike
Time-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural
activity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also
proposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,
assigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a
single spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to
conventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available
datasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance
while significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep
learning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is
validated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies
power curtailment events in a solar inverter. These results highlight its
potential for sustainable and efficient anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DecompGAIL方法来解决多智能体交通仿真中GAIL不稳定的问题，通过分解真实感为ego-map和ego-neighbor组件，过滤误导性交互，并在SMART骨干网络上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交通仿真方法存在局限性：行为克隆存在协变量偏移问题，而GAIL在多智能体设置中不稳定，主要原因是无关交互误导——判别器会因邻居间的不真实交互而惩罚智能体的真实行为。

Method: DecompGAIL方法：1）将真实感显式分解为ego-map和ego-neighbor组件；2）过滤掉误导性的邻居-邻居和邻居-地图交互；3）引入社会PPO目标，用距离加权的邻域奖励增强ego奖励；4）集成到轻量级SMART骨干网络中。

Result: 在WOMD Sim Agents 2025基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DecompGAIL通过分解真实感和过滤误导性交互，有效解决了多智能体GAIL的不稳定性问题，为自动驾驶系统和城市交通规划提供了更真实的交通仿真。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for the development of autonomous
driving systems and urban mobility planning, yet existing imitation learning
approaches often fail to model realistic traffic behaviors. Behavior cloning
suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
(GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key
source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a
discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic
interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed
Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map
and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and
neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that
augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging
overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based
backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim
Agents 2025 benchmark.

Abstract: This study explores the explainability capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), when employed to autonomously generate machine learning (ML) solutions.
We examine two classification tasks: (i) a binary classification problem
focused on predicting driver alertness states, and (ii) a multilabel
classification problem based on the yeast dataset. Three state-of-the-art LLMs
(i.e. OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and DeepSeek) are prompted to design
training pipelines for four common classifiers: Random Forest, XGBoost,
Multilayer Perceptron, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The generated
models are evaluated in terms of predictive performance (recall, precision, and
F1-score) and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
Specifically, we measure Average SHAP Fidelity (Mean Squared Error between SHAP
approximations and model outputs) and Average SHAP Sparsity (number of features
deemed influential). The results reveal that LLMs are capable of producing
effective and interpretable models, achieving high fidelity and consistent
sparsity, highlighting their potential as automated tools for interpretable ML
pipeline generation. The results show that LLMs can produce effective,
interpretable pipelines with high fidelity and consistent sparsity, closely
matching manually engineered baselines.

TL;DR: 提出分组差分注意力(GDA)，通过非平衡的头分配策略改进Transformer的自注意力机制，增强信号聚焦能力并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自注意力机制存在效率问题，经常将大量注意力分配给冗余或噪声上下文。差分注意力虽然解决了这个问题，但其平衡的头分配限制了表示灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: GDA在信号保留组和噪声控制组之间引入非平衡的头分配策略，为信号提取分配更多头，为噪声控制分配较少头，并通过受控重复来稳定噪声控制组。

Result: 大规模预训练和持续训练实验表明，GDA中的适度不平衡比率相比对称基线在泛化性和稳定性方面带来显著改进。

Conclusion: 比率感知的头分配和选择性扩展为设计可扩展、计算高效的Transformer架构提供了有效且实用的路径。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, while foundational to modern Transformer
architectures, suffers from a critical inefficiency: it frequently allocates
substantial attention to redundant or noisy context. Differential Attention
addressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but
its required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on
representational flexibility and scalability.
  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel
approach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving
and noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by
strategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to
noise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to
GQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational
overhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a
scalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,
thereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.
  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we
demonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial
improvements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.
Our results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and
selective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing
scalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.

Motivation: 联邦学习中的遗忘机制面临公平性缺失和现实数据异质性被忽视的问题，现有方法在真实场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出了FedCCCU方法，通过跨客户端约束来显式处理公平性和现实数据异质性挑战。

Result: 实验表明现有方法在现实设置下表现较差，而FedCCCU方法始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedCCCU为现实世界的联邦遗忘提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is critical for enforcing data deletion rights like the
"right to be forgotten." As a decentralized paradigm, Federated Learning (FL)
also requires unlearning, but realistic implementations face two major
challenges. First, fairness in Federated Unlearning (FU) is often overlooked.
Exact unlearning methods typically force all clients into costly retraining,
even those uninvolved. Approximate approaches, using gradient ascent or
distillation, make coarse interventions that can unfairly degrade performance
for clients with only retained data. Second, most FU evaluations rely on
synthetic data assumptions (IID/non-IID) that ignore real-world heterogeneity.
These unrealistic benchmarks obscure the true impact of unlearning and limit
the applicability of current methods. We first conduct a comprehensive
benchmark of existing FU methods under realistic data heterogeneity and
fairness conditions. We then propose a novel, fairness-aware FU approach,
Federated Cross-Client-Constrains Unlearning (FedCCCU), to explicitly address
both challenges. FedCCCU offers a practical and scalable solution for
real-world FU. Experimental results show that existing methods perform poorly
in realistic settings, while our approach consistently outperforms them.

Abstract: Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal
graph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender
systems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting
state-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity
prediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving
Average, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in
training current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction
and suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -
Node Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the
equivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,
training NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss
function for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that
it outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is

Conclusion: FlexMol框架能够灵活处理单模态输入，同时学习统一的分子表示，在分子性质预测任务中取得了显著成果。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning plays a crucial role in advancing
applications such as drug discovery and material design. Existing work
leverages 2D and 3D modalities of molecular information for pre-training,
aiming to capture comprehensive structural and geometric insights. However,
these methods require paired 2D and 3D molecular data to train the model
effectively and prevent it from collapsing into a single modality, posing
limitations in scenarios where a certain modality is unavailable or
computationally expensive to generate. To overcome this limitation, we propose
FlexMol, a flexible molecule pre-training framework that learns unified
molecular representations while supporting single-modality input. Specifically,
inspired by the unified structure in vision-language models, our approach
employs separate models for 2D and 3D molecular data, leverages parameter
sharing to improve computational efficiency, and utilizes a decoder to generate
features for the missing modality. This enables a multistage continuous
learning process where both modalities contribute collaboratively during
training, while ensuring robustness when only one modality is available during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexMol achieves superior
performance across a wide range of molecular property prediction tasks, and we
also empirically demonstrate its effectiveness with incomplete data. Our code

Motivation: 随着量子机器学习特别是量子神经网络的兴趣增长，研究基于Fisher信息矩阵的评估指标如何有效预测其训练和预测性能。

Method: 利用QNN与傅里叶模型的等价性，推导傅里叶模型的FIM解析表达式，构建具有可调有效维度和偏置的模型进行比较分析，并引入张量网络表示。

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular
quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation
metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for
predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the
equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the
interplay between the \emph{effective dimension} and the \emph{bias} of a model
towards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and
performance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,
towards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results
in a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that
are biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is
likely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an
analytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features
controlling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models
with tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We
furthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier
models, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN
models. Overall, these findings provide an explicit example of the interplay
between geometrical properties, model-task alignment and training, which are
relevant for the broader machine learning community.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and
robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation
framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed
maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether
the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks
over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present
a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights
consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A
semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent
objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model
learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,
thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and
structural variations.

Conclusion: HTMformer通过增强的特征提取能力构建了轻量级预测器，证明了改进嵌入方法对提升Transformer在时间序列预测中性能的重要性。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series
forecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in
sequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This
incurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding
performance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly
dependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To
address this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective
information captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional
embeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.
These representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand
the series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate
Embeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature
extraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction
module to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between
model complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer
architecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction
capability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments
conducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型表现出优异的实证性能，但其训练动态的基本原理在特定配置研究之外缺乏充分表征。受语言模型在小初始化尺度下改进推理能力的实证证据启发，作者希望系统研究Transformer训练动态。

Method: 采用[Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022]建立的梯度流分析框架，对线性化Transformer的训练动态进行理论分析，将注意力模块动态分解为两个阶段。

Result: 分析发现：第一阶段，随机初始化的不对称权重扰动维持参数矩阵中的非退化梯度动态，促进从小初始化机制的系统逃逸；第二阶段，之前静态的键查询矩阵积极参与训练，驱动归一化矩阵趋向渐近秩塌缩。

Conclusion: 这种两阶段框架推广了经典的方向收敛结果，为理解Transformer训练动态提供了理论洞见。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown exceptional empirical
performance, the fundamental principles governing their training dynamics are
inadequately characterized beyond configuration-specific studies. Inspired by
empirical evidence showing improved reasoning capabilities under small
initialization scales in language models, we employ the gradient flow
analytical framework established in [Zhou et al. NeurIPS 2022] to
systematically investigate linearized Transformer training dynamics. Our
theoretical analysis dissects the dynamics of attention modules into two
distinct stages. In the first stage, asymmetric weight perturbations from
random initialization sustain non-degenerate gradient dynamics in parameter
matrices, facilitating systematic escape from small initialization regimes.
Subsequently, these matrices undergo condensation, progressively aligning
toward the target orientation. In the second stage, the previously static
key-query matrices actively participate in training, driving the normalized
matrices toward asymptotic rank collapse. This two-stage framework generalizes
classical directional convergence results.

Motivation: 集成微调模型虽然能提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性，但计算成本高昂。Dropout作为轻量级替代方案在预训练模型上容易过度正则化并破坏关键表示。

Method: 使用Mixout技术，以高掩码概率（ViT为0.9，ResNet为0.8）在训练过程中概率性地将微调权重替换为预训练权重，既惩罚偏离预训练参数又减少计算开销。

Result: 在五个领域泛化基准测试中，高率Mixout达到了与集成方法相当的域外准确率，同时显著降低训练成本：梯度计算减少45%，梯度内存使用减少90%。

Conclusion: 高率Mixout在领域泛化任务中实现了与集成方法相当的性能，同时大幅降低了计算和内存开销，为轻量级领域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is
a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes
with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store
multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating
ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to
pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical
representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate
Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to
Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout
mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned
weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby
maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our
study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain
generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9
for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it
yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates
more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting
better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking
substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by
up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five
domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and
DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,
High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based
methods while significantly reducing training costs.

TL;DR: 提出状态化多智能体进化搜索框架，通过持久化推理状态、对抗性变异和进化保留，显著提升单元测试生成中的边缘用例发现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无状态推理方法在多步骤任务中表现不佳，缺乏持久状态；特定任务微调只能实现表面代码生成，对需要深度推理和长程依赖的任务仍然脆弱。

Method: 状态化多智能体进化搜索框架，包含持久推理状态、对抗性变异和进化保留机制。专用智能体顺序提出、变异和评分候选用例，控制器维护跨代持久状态。

Result: 在HumanEval和TestGenEvalMini等基准测试中，相比无状态单步基线方法，在覆盖率方面取得显著提升，使用Llama、Gemma和GPT三种LLM家族验证。

Conclusion: 持久推理状态与进化搜索相结合，能显著改进单元测试生成，产生更鲁棒、高覆盖率的边缘用例。

Abstract: Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,
multi-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on
multi-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,
task-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level
code generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and
long-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful
multi-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from
prior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,
(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate
its effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of
edge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,
where specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A
controller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary
preservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This
yields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge
cases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent
inference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless
single-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as
HumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,
Gemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time
state with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GMixout是一种改进的随机正则化方法，通过动态权重锚点和显式重采样频率调节，在微调视觉基础模型时同时提升域内准确性和分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法虽然能提高域内准确性，但会损害模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。Mixout正则化器通过间歇性替换微调权重来缓解这个问题，但其固定锚点和隐式重采样机制存在局限性。

Method: 提出GMixout方法：(i) 使用指数移动平均快照作为动态锚点替代固定锚点；(ii) 通过显式重采样频率超参数调节掩码周期；(iii) 采用稀疏核实现，仅更新少量参数且无推理开销。

Result: 在ImageNet/ImageNet-LT、DomainNet、iWildCam和CIFAR100-C等基准测试中，GMixout在保持域内准确性提升的同时，在协变量偏移、损坏和类别不平衡等分布偏移场景下，超越了Model Soups和参数高效微调基线方法。

Conclusion: GMixout通过动态锚点和显式频率调节，有效平衡了微调模型的域内准确性和分布偏移鲁棒性，为视觉基础模型的鲁棒微调提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but
comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a
stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with
their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing
implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern
robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and
\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)
replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that
adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit
resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates
only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling
training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate
shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,
iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy
beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong
parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

TL;DR: ELMUR是一种具有结构化外部记忆的Transformer架构，通过双向交叉注意力和LRU记忆模块处理长序列依赖，在部分可观测环境中显著提升决策性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实机器人需要在部分可观测性和长视野下决策，但现有方法主要依赖瞬时信息，难以处理长期依赖。标准循环或Transformer模型在长序列下存在上下文截断和记忆扩展失败的问题

Method: 提出ELMUR架构，每层维护记忆嵌入，通过双向交叉注意力与记忆交互，使用LRU记忆模块通过替换或凸混合进行记忆更新

Result: 在合成T-Maze任务中达到100%成功率（走廊长达100万步），在POPGym中超过半数任务优于基线，在MIKASA-Robo稀疏奖励操作任务中性能几乎翻倍

Conclusion: 结构化、层局部外部记忆为部分可观测环境下的决策提供了一种简单且可扩展的方法

Abstract: Real-world robotic agents must act under partial observability and long
horizons, where key cues may appear long before they affect decision making.
However, most modern approaches rely solely on instantaneous information,
without incorporating insights from the past. Standard recurrent or transformer
models struggle with retaining and leveraging long-term dependencies: context
windows truncate history, while naive memory extensions fail under scale and
sparsity. We propose ELMUR (External Layer Memory with Update/Rewrite), a
transformer architecture with structured external memory. Each layer maintains
memory embeddings, interacts with them via bidirectional cross-attention, and
updates them through an Least Recently Used (LRU) memory module using
replacement or convex blending. ELMUR extends effective horizons up to 100,000
times beyond the attention window and achieves a 100% success rate on a
synthetic T-Maze task with corridors up to one million steps. In POPGym, it
outperforms baselines on more than half of the tasks. On MIKASA-Robo
sparse-reward manipulation tasks with visual observations, it nearly doubles
the performance of strong baselines. These results demonstrate that structured,
layer-local external memory offers a simple and scalable approach to decision
making under partial observability.

Motivation: 网络威胁日益复杂，流量数据存在类别不平衡问题，现有方法难以同时处理拓扑结构和时序依赖关系，且缺乏有效应对数据不平衡的机制。

Method: 结合门控时序卷积网络(G-TCN)提取时序特征和图卷积网络(GCN)学习图结构，通过图注意力网络(GAT)实现残差学习机制，保留原始特征信息以缓解类别不平衡。

Result: 在UNSW-NB15和ToN-IoT数据集上的实验表明，GTCN-G在二元和多类分类任务中显著优于现有基线模型，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GTCN-G框架成功解决了入侵检测中的时序-空间特征融合和数据不平衡问题，为网络安全提供了有效的深度学习解决方案。

Abstract: The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance
in traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological
structures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in
capturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates
both while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This
paper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal
Convolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these
limitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting
hierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core
innovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,
implemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves
original feature information through residual connections, which is critical
for mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity
for rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to
validate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
GTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming
existing baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本量化方法在生成合成数据时未考虑量化模型的锐度，而低锐度的深度神经网络具有更好的泛化能力

Method: 通过最大化重构损失梯度在合成数据和真实验证数据之间的匹配来实现锐度最小化，在没有真实验证集的情况下，使用生成样本与其邻居之间的梯度匹配来近似

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法在低比特量化设置下优于现有最先进技术

Conclusion: 提出的考虑量化模型锐度的零样本量化方法能有效提升模型泛化性能，在低比特量化场景下表现优异

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common
idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for
quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural
networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the
previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized
model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a
novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in
synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first
demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient
matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and
real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem
of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with
the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.
Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in
low-bit quantization settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoIF是一个轻量级模型，通过整合家族内同源序列谱和跨家族结构进化约束，实现了蛋白质突变适应性预测的先进性能，仅需0.15%训练数据和较少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质突变适应性预测对蛋白质工程至关重要，但受限于有限的实验数据与庞大序列空间之间的矛盾。现有蛋白质语言模型(pLMs)虽能进行零样本预测，但需要更高效和精确的方法。

Method: 将自然进化视为隐式奖励最大化，掩码语言建模(MLM)作为逆强化学习(IRL)。EvoIF整合两种进化信号：(i)从检索同源序列获得的家族内谱，(ii)从逆折叠logits提取的跨家族结构进化约束，通过紧凑转换块融合序列-结构表示。

Result: 在ProteinGym基准测试(217个突变实验；>250万突变体)上，EvoIF及其MSA增强变体达到最先进或竞争性性能，仅使用0.15%训练数据和较少参数。消融实验证实家族内和跨家族谱具有互补性，提高了跨功能类型、MSA深度、分类群和突变深度的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EvoIF提供了一个高效且可解释的框架，通过整合互补的进化信号实现了蛋白质突变适应性的准确预测，为蛋白质工程提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering
but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.
Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)
exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by
interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as
inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert
demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this
perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two
complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from
retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints
distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure
representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding
calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational
assays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve
state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the
training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm
that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving
robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The
codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.

TL;DR: MLE-Smith是一个全自动多智能体流水线，通过生成-验证-执行范式将原始数据集转化为竞赛式机器学习工程挑战，解决了MLE训练数据获取困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLE基准测试存在可扩展性低和适用性有限的问题，因为它们依赖于静态、手动策划的任务，需要大量时间和人工努力来制作。

Method: 采用多智能体流水线驱动结构化任务设计和标准化重构，结合混合验证机制强制执行严格的结构规则和高级语义合理性，并通过交互式执行验证经验可解性和真实世界保真度。

Result: 在224个真实世界数据集上生成606个任务，涵盖多个类别、目标和模态。评估显示主流LLM在MLE-Smith任务上的表现与在人工设计任务上的表现高度相关。

Conclusion: MLE-Smith能够有效扩展MLE任务规模，同时保持任务质量，为机器学习工程提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据生成方案。

Abstract: While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating
machine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE
training data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from
low scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually
curated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We
introduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw
datasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient
generate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,
real-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in
MLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled
with a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and
high-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and
real-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of
real-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,
objectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively
across a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks
shows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on
MLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully
human-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to
scaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用现有数据扩展强化学习解决长视距问题提供了高效路径，理论上样本复杂度相比全视距训练有指数级改进。

Abstract: Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance
drops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this
rely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of
which scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap
long-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon
data. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,
multi-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data
using outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in
complexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.
Empirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on
composed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,
competition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.
Importantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than
baselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning
paths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards
achieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon
training, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1
therefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon
problems using only existing data.

Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM智能体需要通过多轮交互掌握策略性工具使用和用户偏好优化，以帮助用户完成复杂规划任务。

Method: 构建了覆盖20个美国国家公园的交通、住宿和票务的真实旅行数据库，以及模拟商业预订平台的综合工具生态系统。

Result: 评估发现两个关键差距：(i)可接受-最优差距：智能体可靠满足约束但未能优化偏好；(ii)计划协调差距：在多服务协调任务上性能崩溃，特别是开源模型。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过在实际用户导向领域中建立推理和规划，提供了一个直接衡量智能体在现实任务中优化用户偏好能力的基准，连接理论进展与现实影响。

Abstract: Real-world large language model (LLM) agents must master strategic tool use
and user preference optimization through multi-turn interactions to assist
users with complex planning tasks. We introduce COMPASS (Constrained
Optimization through Multi-turn Planning and Strategic Solutions), a benchmark
that evaluates agents on realistic travel-planning scenarios. We cast travel
planning as a constrained preference optimization problem, where agents must
satisfy hard constraints while simultaneously optimizing soft user preferences.
To support this, we build a realistic travel database covering transportation,
accommodation, and ticketing for 20 U.S. National Parks, along with a
comprehensive tool ecosystem that mirrors commercial booking platforms.
Evaluating state-of-the-art models, we uncover two critical gaps: (i) an
acceptable-optimal gap, where agents reliably meet constraints but fail to
optimize preferences, and (ii) a plan-coordination gap, where performance
collapses on multi-service (flight and hotel) coordination tasks, especially
for open-source models. By grounding reasoning and planning in a practical,
user-facing domain, COMPASS provides a benchmark that directly measures an
agent's ability to optimize user preferences in realistic tasks, bridging
theoretical advances with real-world impact.

Motivation: 解决语音情感识别中传统超参数优化方法耗时过长的问题，探索在有限计算资源下实现高效优化的可能性

Method: 使用SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base模型作为编码器，比较高斯过程贝叶斯优化和树结构Parzen估计器两种HPO策略，在相同搜索空间和试验预算下进行优化

Result: GP-BO在11分钟内达到0.96平衡准确率，TPE在15分钟内达到0.97，显著优于网格搜索和AutoSpeech 2020基线；跨语言泛化实验显示性能提升0.25-0.26

Conclusion: 预训练编码器结合高效HPO可在普通CPU上实现竞争性的语音情感识别性能，为资源受限环境提供了可行方案

Abstract: We propose a workflow for speech emotion recognition (SER) that combines
pre-trained representations with automated hyperparameter optimisation (HPO).
Using SpeechBrain wav2vec2-base model fine-tuned on IEMOCAP as the encoder, we
compare two HPO strategies, Gaussian Process Bayesian Optimisation (GP-BO) and
Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), under an identical four-dimensional
search space and 15-trial budget, with balanced class accuracy (BCA) on the
German EmoDB corpus as the objective. All experiments run on 8 CPU cores with
32 GB RAM. GP-BO achieves 0.96 BCA in 11 minutes, and TPE (Hyperopt
implementation) attains 0.97 in 15 minutes. In contrast, grid search requires
143 trials and 1,680 minutes to exceed 0.9 BCA, and the best AutoSpeech 2020
baseline reports only 0.85 in 30 minutes on GPU. For cross-lingual
generalisation, an EmoDB-trained HPO-tuned model improves zero-shot accuracy by
0.25 on CREMA-D and 0.26 on RAVDESS. Results show that efficient HPO with
pre-trained encoders delivers competitive SER on commodity CPUs. Source code to

Motivation: 传统无线电地图构建方法需要位置标记的CSI数据，这在实践中具有挑战性。本文旨在解决大规模MIMO网络中无需位置标签的CSI获取问题。

Method: 建立隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)来连接移动设备的隐藏轨迹与大规模MIMO信道的CSI演化，从而估计移动设备位置并构建角度功率地图。

Result: 在均匀直线移动和泊松分布基站的假设下，定位误差的克拉美-罗下界可以在任何信噪比下消失；而在基站受限区域，即使有无限独立测量，误差仍保持非零。基于真实多小区大规模MIMO网络的RSRP数据，实现了平均18米的定位误差。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖位置标签的情况下有效构建角度功率地图，为大规模MIMO网络的无线电资源管理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a
promising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI
acquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction
require location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper
investigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large
timescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a
mobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the
mobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power
map. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed
base stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error
can vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined
to a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent
measurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in
a real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18
meters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single
serving cell.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对非平稳环境中的在线结构化预测问题，提出了一种新的遗憾界形式：$F_T + C(1 + P_T)$，其中$F_T$是比较器序列的累积代理损失，$P_T$是其路径长度。该界通过结合在线梯度下降的动态遗憾界和代理间隙技术，在非平稳环境中提供更强的性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线结构化预测中的代理遗憾界在平稳环境中表现良好，但在非平稳环境中会失效，因为固定估计器的代理损失会随$T$线性增长。需要开发适用于非平稳环境的理论框架。

Method: 将在线梯度下降(OGD)的动态遗憾界与利用代理间隙的技术相结合，提出新的Polyak风格学习率，并通过卷积Fenchel-Young损失扩展到更广泛的问题类别。

Result: 证明了形式为$F_T + C(1 + P_T)$的累积目标损失上界，该界仅通过$F_T$和$P_T$依赖于$T$，在非平稳环境中提供更强的保证。同时证明了该界对$F_T$和$P_T$的依赖是紧的。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在非平稳环境中显著改善了在线结构化预测的性能保证，新的Polyak风格学习率在理论和实验中都表现出色，为动态环境中的在线学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Online structured prediction, including online classification as a special
case, is the task of sequentially predicting labels from input features.
Therein the surrogate regret -- the cumulative excess of the target loss (e.g.,
0-1 loss) over the surrogate loss (e.g., logistic loss) of the fixed best
estimator -- has gained attention, particularly because it often admits a
finite bound independent of the time horizon $T$. However, such guarantees
break down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may
incur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving
a bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where
$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its
path length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only
through $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in
non-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret
bound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the
surrogate gap. Our analysis also sheds light on a new Polyak-style learning
rate for OGD, which systematically offers target-loss guarantees and exhibits
promising empirical performance. We further extend our approach to a broader
class of problems via the convolutional Fenchel--Young loss. Finally, we prove
a lower bound showing that the dependence on $F_T$ and $P_T$ is tight.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The
informativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically
quantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the
efficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level
$\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds
on the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length
for conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild
assumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n} + 1/(\alpha^2 n) + 1/\sqrt{m} + \exp(-\alpha^2 m))$
capture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,
the calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\alpha$. The results
identify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of
$\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction
set length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.

*Mariona Jaramillo-Civill,Peng Wu,Pau Closas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPMM-CFL算法，使用狄利克雷过程先验来自动推断聚类数量，解决了传统聚类联邦学习需要预先设定聚类数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类联邦学习方法需要预先固定聚类数量K，但在实际应用中潜在聚类结构通常是未知的，这限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 在聚类参数分布上放置狄利克雷过程先验，通过非参数贝叶斯推断联合推断聚类数量和客户端分配，同时优化每个聚类的联邦目标。

Result: 在Dirichlet和类分割非IID分区下的基准数据集上验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: DPMM-CFL能够自动推断聚类结构，实现了联邦更新和聚类推断的耦合，为处理客户端异构性提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) improves performance under non-IID client
heterogeneity by clustering clients and training one model per cluster, thereby
balancing between a global model and fully personalized models. However, most
CFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is
impractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL
algorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of
cluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly
infer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing
per-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each
round, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in
this paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet
and class-split non-IID partitions.

*Patrick Peixuan Ye,Chen Shani,Ellen Vitercik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Bridged Clustering半监督框架，通过独立聚类输入X和输出Y，然后用少量配对样本学习稀疏可解释的桥梁，实现高效预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督学习未充分利用输出数据，而密集传输方法缺乏可解释性，需要一种既高效又解释性强的框架。

Method: 首先独立聚类输入和输出数据集，然后用少量配对样本学习稀疏的簇间桥梁，预测时通过最近邻输入簇找到对应输出簇中心作为预测。

Result: 理论分析表明在有限误聚类和误桥接率下算法有效，实验显示在低监督设置下与SOTA方法竞争且标签效率高。

Conclusion: Bridged Clustering是简单、模型无关、高度标签高效的半监督学习方法，在保持稀疏可解释性的同时实现竞争性能。

Abstract: We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn
predictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first
clusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge
between clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input
$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked
output cluster is returned as the prediction $\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,
Bridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense
transport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.
Through theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and
mis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.
Empirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining
simple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究表明，无论模型和数据集规模如何，仅需约250个恶意文档就能成功实施预训练投毒攻击，攻击所需文档数量不随模型规模增加而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设攻击者控制一定比例的训练语料，但对于大型模型，即使很小比例也意味着不切实际的大量数据。本文首次证明投毒攻击所需的文档数量基本恒定，与数据集大小无关。

Method: 进行了迄今为止最大规模的预训练投毒实验，训练参数从6亿到130亿的模型，使用Chinchilla最优数据集（60亿到2600亿token）。同时进行了小规模实验来研究影响攻击成功的因素。

Result: 发现250个投毒文档在所有模型和数据集规模下都能类似地危害模型，尽管最大模型训练了超过20倍的干净数据。在微调过程中也观察到相同的动态。

Conclusion: 通过数据投毒注入后门对大型模型来说可能比之前认为的更容易，因为所需的投毒数量不随模型规模增加而增加，这凸显了需要更多防御研究来减轻未来模型中的这种风险。

Abstract: Poisoning attacks can compromise the safety of large language models (LLMs)
by injecting malicious documents into their training data. Existing work has
studied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the
training corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to
impractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time
that poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents
regardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning
experiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on
chinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned
documents similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,
despite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We
also run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence
attack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and
non-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same
dynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning. Altogether, our results suggest that
injecting backdoors through data poisoning may be easier for large models than
previously believed as the number of poisons required does not scale up with
model size, highlighting the need for more research on defences to mitigate
this risk in future models.

*Joris Dommel,Sven A. Wegner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在宽度w=n和w=n+1时神经网络对Hanin-Sellke反例函数的逼近能力，分析了深度变化对逼近质量的影响以及神经元死亡现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hanin和Sellke在2017年证明了当且仅当w>n时，ReLU激活的任意深度前馈神经网络才能在紧集上一致逼近连续函数。本文旨在研究在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络对Hanin-Sellke反例函数的实际逼近能力。

Method: 作者通过实验方法，在宽度w=n和w=n+1的情况下，尝试用神经网络逼近Hanin-Sellke的反例函数，并研究深度变化对逼近效果的影响。

Result: 研究发现，在宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络确实能够在一定程度上逼近反例函数，但逼近质量受到深度变化的影响，并观察到神经元死亡现象对逼近行为的影响。

Conclusion: 即使在临界宽度w=n和w=n+1时，神经网络仍具有一定的逼近能力，但深度和神经元死亡现象会显著影响逼近质量，这为理解神经网络表达能力的边界提供了新的见解。

Abstract: In 2017, Hanin and Sellke showed that the class of arbitrarily deep,
real-valued, feed-forward and ReLU-activated networks of width w forms a dense
subset of the space of continuous functions on R^n, with respect to the
topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, if and only if w>n holds. To
show the necessity, a concrete counterexample function f:R^n->R was used. In
this note we actually approximate this very f by neural networks in the two
cases w=n and w=n+1 around the aforementioned threshold. We study how the
approximation quality behaves if we vary the depth and what effect (spoiler
alert: dying neurons) cause that behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MoE架构在现代AI系统中广泛应用，但其训练动态的理论理解仍然有限，仅限于专家-路由器分离优化或特定路由场景。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 采用学生-教师框架，分析软路由MoE模型的联合训练，其中路由器和专家都是非线性的，并包含训练后剪枝和微调过程。

Result: 证明了在适度过参数化条件下，学生网络能够通过特征学习阶段恢复教师网络参数，训练后剪枝能有效消除冗余神经元，微调过程可收敛到全局最优。

Conclusion: 这是首个深入理解MoE架构优化景观的分析，为MoE训练动态提供了理论保证和新见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a cornerstone of
modern AI systems. In particular, MoEs route inputs dynamically to specialized
experts whose outputs are aggregated through weighted summation. Despite their
widespread application, theoretical understanding of MoE training dynamics
remains limited to either separate expert-router optimization or only top-1
routing scenarios with carefully constructed datasets. This paper advances MoE
theory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed
MoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.
We prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network
undergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is
``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters. Moreover, we
show that a post-training pruning can effectively eliminate redundant neurons,
followed by a provably convergent fine-tuning process that reaches global
optimality. To our knowledge, our analysis is the first to bring novel insights
in understanding the optimization landscape of the MoE architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了Thompson Sampling作为在线优化算法的本质，通过引入"忠实"平稳化方法将动态优化问题转换为平稳目标，从而解释了其如何平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling虽然被广泛使用和研究，但其通过后验采样来"正确"平衡探索与利用的确切机制仍然是个谜，本文旨在解决这一核心问题。

Method: 引入"忠实"平稳化方法，将有限时域动态优化问题转换为平稳目标，使用Bellman原理推导时间不变最优策略，从而将Thompson Sampling重新表述为在线优化算法。

Result: 发现Thompson Sampling具有简单的在线优化形式，模仿Bellman最优策略的结构，其中贪婪性通过基于点二列相关性的剩余不确定性度量进行正则化。

Conclusion: 这回答了Thompson Sampling如何平衡探索与利用的问题，并为研究和改进Thompson原始思想提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit
algorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid
theoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit
algorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced
by Thompson) is able to "properly" balance exploration and exploitation,
remains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this
question stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization
algorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer
to as "faithful" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the
finite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary
counterpart which "closely resembles" the original objective (in contrast, the
classical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins
index, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly
crafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which
leads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,
Thompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the
structure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by
a measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This
answers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances
exploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to
study and further improve Thompson's original idea.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了判别性特征反馈（DFF）学习协议的理论性质，分析了在可实现和不可实现设置下的最优错误界限，揭示了DFF与在线学习的关键差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFF学习协议使用判别性特征解释作为反馈，但缺乏与经典协议（如监督学习和在线学习）相媲美的系统理论研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，深入理解DFF的理论特性。

Method: 在一般框架下系统研究DFF协议，分析可实现和不可实现设置下的最优错误界限，引入新的维度概念来刻画可实现设置下的错误界限。

Result: 在可实现设置中，使用新维度概念刻画了错误界限；在不可实现设置中，给出了错误上界并证明其一般不可改进。结果显示DFF与在线学习存在本质差异。

Conclusion: DFF与在线学习有显著差异：在DFF中，可实现维度不足以刻画最优不可实现错误界限或无遗憾算法的存在性，这揭示了更丰富反馈设置下的新理论特性。

Abstract: We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol
Discriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning
protocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We
provide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is
comparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and
online learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable
and the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well
as insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with
richer feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the
realizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable
setting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved
in general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable
dimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake
bound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.

TL;DR: TTGS是一种轻量级规划方法，通过构建数据集状态图并进行快速搜索来组装子目标序列，以解决离线目标条件强化学习中的长时决策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在长时决策中存在时间信用分配和误差累积问题，离线设置会放大这些效应，需要一种轻量级规划方法来缓解这些问题。

Method: TTGS接受任何状态空间距离或成本信号，构建数据集状态的加权图，执行快速搜索来组装子目标序列，由冻结策略执行。对于基于值的学习器，距离直接从学习的目标条件值函数中推导。

Result: 在OGBench基准测试中，TTGS提高了多个基础学习器在挑战性运动任务上的成功率。

Conclusion: 简单的度量引导测试时规划对离线GCRL有益，TTGS无需改变训练、额外监督、在线交互或特权信息，完全在推理时运行。

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that
reach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,
domain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free
datasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL
agents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the
offline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
Test-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the
GCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a
weighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a
sequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is
value-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned
value function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to
training, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged
information, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS
improves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion
tasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for
offline GCRL.

TL;DR: MolGA是一种通过灵活整合分子领域知识来适应预训练2D图编码器到下游分子应用的方法，包括分子对齐策略和条件适应机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练2D图编码器忽略了与亚分子实例相关的丰富分子领域知识，而专门的分子预训练方法缺乏整合多样化知识的灵活性。

Method: 提出分子对齐策略来桥接预训练拓扑表示与领域知识表示之间的差距，并引入条件适应机制生成实例特定令牌以实现细粒度知识整合。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上的广泛实验证明了MolGA的有效性。

Conclusion: MolGA提供了一种实用的替代方案，能够重用广泛可用且经过良好验证的预训练2D编码器，同时在下游适应过程中整合分子领域知识。

Abstract: Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and
biomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated
strong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge
associated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular
pre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training
objectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of
knowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in
molecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D
encoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream
adaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose
MolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular
applications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.
First, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between
pre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.
Second, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates
instance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain
knowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on
eleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.

Motivation: 在加权公平分配中，WMMS是一个重要的公平性概念，但长期以来是否存在常数因子近似算法一直未知，这是该领域的重要开放问题。

Method: 引入了典型实例归约和代理估值的不同界限，通过这些技术手段构建了常数因子近似算法。

Result: 成功设计了第一个常数因子近似WMMS算法，同时证明了优于2-近似的保证是不可能的，将已知下界从1.366提高到2。

Conclusion: 本文在加权公平分配领域取得了突破性进展，首次实现了WMMS的常数因子近似，并建立了最优近似比的界限。

Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible chores among agents with
asymmetric weights. Among the various fairness notions, weighted maximin share
(WMMS) stands out as particularly compelling. However, whether WMMS admits a
constant-factor approximation has remained unknown and is one of the important
open problems in weighted fair division [ALMW22, Suk25]. So far, the best known
approximation ratio is O(log n), where n is the number of agents. In this
paper, we advance the state of the art and present the first constant-factor
approximate WMMS algorithm. To this end, we introduce canonical instance
reductions and different bounds of agents' valuations. We also prove that
guaranteeing better than 2-approximation is not possible, which improves the
best-known lower bound of 1.366.

Motivation: 解决基础模型推理能力的两大瓶颈：模型内在能力有限和测试时迭代不可靠，旨在提升模型的推理性能。

Method: 通过编排多个模型和专业工具实现可验证推理，结合计算工具（Python与数值/符号库）和检索工具（任务相关外部信息）进行精确计算和决策，使用共享状态图支持多轮多模型解决方案演化。

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025评估中，Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct模型获得+5.15% Average@32和+23.34% Pass@32提升，Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct模型获得+8.91% Average@32和+26.67% Pass@32提升，超过80%的工具调用成功执行。

Conclusion: AlphaApollo系统通过工具使用显著提升了基础模型的能力上限，证明了多模型协作和工具整合在推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present AlphaApollo, a self-evolving agentic reasoning system that aims to
address two bottlenecks in foundation model (FM) reasoning-limited
model-intrinsic capacity and unreliable test-time iteration. AlphaApollo
orchestrates multiple models with professional tools to enable deliberate,
verifiable reasoning. It couples (i) a computation tool (Python with numerical

further supports multi-round, multi-model solution evolution via a shared state
map that records candidates, executable checks, and feedback for iterative
refinement. In evaluations on AIME 2024/2025 across multiple models,
AlphaApollo delivers consistent gains: +5.15% Average@32 and +23.34% Pass@32
for Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, and +8.91% Average@32 with +26.67% Pass@32 for
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. Tool-use analysis shows that more than 80% of tool

Motivation: 当前AI在模式识别任务上取得进展，但缺乏对推理能力的明确定义和度量标准，需要建立系统化的评估框架。

Conclusion: 复杂性分布外泛化不能仅通过扩展数据解决，需要专门针对复杂性的架构和训练机制来实现稳健推理。

Abstract: Recent progress has pushed AI frontiers from pattern recognition tasks toward
problems that require step by step, System2 style reasoning, especially with
large language models. Yet, unlike learning, where generalization and out of
distribution (OoD) evaluation concepts are well formalized, there is no clear,
consistent definition or metric for reasoning ability. We propose Complexity
Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization as a framework and problem
setting to define and measure reasoning. A model exhibits Complexity OoD
generalization when it maintains performance on test instances whose minimal
required solution complexity, either representational (richer solution
structure) or computational (more reasoning steps/program length), exceeds that
of all training examples. We formalize complexity via solution description
Kolmogorov complexity and operational proxies (e.g., object/relation counts;
reasoning step counts), clarifying how Complexity OoD differs from length and
compositional OoD. This lens unifies learning and reasoning: many cases
solvable with System1 like processing at low complexity become System2 like
under complexity pressure, while System2 can be viewed as generalization over
solution structures. We translate this perspective into practice with
recommendations for operationalizing Complexity OoD across the stack:
incorporating complexity into benchmark and evaluation metric design,
rethinking supervision to target solution traces, seeking and designing
inductive biases for Complexity OoD generalization, addressing learning to
reason spillovers such as spurious shortcuts, semantic robustness, catastrophic
forgetting, and step wise calibration. Because Complexity OoD cannot be solved
by scaling data alone, progress toward robust reasoning will require
architectures and training regimes that explicitly model and allocate
computation with respect to complexity.

Motivation: 当前AI模型主要通过模仿学习，难以解决超出已有数据范围的新问题。需要开发能够通过交互探索获得技能的智能体，但寻找可扩展的学习机制仍是一个重大开放性问题。

Method: BuilderBench包含硬件加速的机器人模拟器和42个多样化目标结构的任务套件。训练时智能体需无监督地探索环境并学习通用原理；评估时需搭建未见过的目标结构。

Result: 实验表明当前算法在许多任务上仍面临挑战。为此提供了"训练轮"协议，让智能体针对单个目标结构进行训练和评估。

Conclusion: BuilderBench为研究开放式探索的智能体预训练提供了基准测试框架，并提供了六种算法的单文件实现作为参考基准。

Abstract: Today's AI models learn primarily through mimicry and sharpening, so it is
not surprising that they struggle to solve problems beyond the limits set by
existing data. To solve novel problems, agents should acquire skills for
exploring and learning through experience. Finding a scalable learning
mechanism for developing agents that learn through interaction remains a major
open problem. In this work, we introduce BuilderBench, a benchmark to
accelerate research into agent pre-training that centers open-ended
exploration. BuilderBench requires agents to learn how to build any structure
using blocks. BuilderBench is equipped with $(1)$ a hardware accelerated
simulator of a robotic agent interacting with various physical blocks, and
$(2)$ a task-suite with over 42 diverse target structures that are carefully
curated to test an understanding of physics, mathematics, and long-horizon
planning. During training, agents have to explore and learn general principles
about the environment without any external supervision. During evaluation,
agents have to build the unseen target structures from the task suite. Solving
these tasks requires a sort of \emph{embodied reasoning} that is not reflected
in words but rather in actions, experimenting with different strategies and
piecing them together. Our experiments show that many of these tasks challenge
the current iteration of algorithms. Hence, we also provide a ``training
wheels'' protocol, in which agents are trained and evaluated to build a single
target structure from the task suite. Finally, we provide single-file
implementations of six different algorithms as a reference point for
researchers.

combination diverse system architectures of merging organizations. Although the
theoretical and practical guidance exists for post-merger integration on the
business level, there is a significant gap in training for information system
integration in this context. In prior research specific methods AMILI (Support
method for informed decision identification) and AMILP (Support method for
informed decision-making) were introduced for the support of information system
integration decisions in the post-merger integration. But during the practical
application was reported high learning curve and low learner motivation. This
paper explores how game-based learning design can address these limitations by
transforming static method training into engaging learning experience. The
study analyzes foundational learning theories, cognitive load and motivation
models, and serious game design frameworks to identify the essential
requirements for a game-based learning design framework tailored to information
system integration in post-merger integration. Requirements are structured in
two components: the transformation process and resulting learning experience.
The paper concludes with a plan for developing and evaluating the proposed
framework through iterative design and real-world validation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了BCCS框架，通过选择最优合作者和校准系统内部信念来促进稳定的共识，在MATH和MMLU基准数据集上分别比现有最佳结果提高了2.23%和3.95%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统共识寻求方法通常依赖投票机制来判断共识，忽视了系统内部信念的矛盾会破坏共识稳定性，且采用无差别的协作方式无法为每个智能体找到最优合作者。

Method: 提出了信念校准共识寻求（BCCS）框架，包括选择最优合作者以最大化共识稳定性，以及通过系统内部信念校准共识判断的理论框架。

Result: 在MATH和MMLU基准数据集上的实验结果表明，BCCS框架在挑战性任务上的准确率分别比现有最佳结果提高了2.23%和3.95%。

Conclusion: BCCS框架通过选择最优合作者和校准系统内部信念，能够有效促进多智能体系统的稳定共识形成，显著提升复杂NLP任务的性能。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) enhances its capacity to solve complex natural
language processing (NLP) tasks through collaboration among multiple agents,
where consensus-seeking serves as a fundamental mechanism. However, existing
consensus-seeking approaches typically rely on voting mechanisms to judge
consensus, overlooking contradictions in system-internal beliefs that
destabilize the consensus. Moreover, these methods often involve agents
updating their results through indiscriminate collaboration with every other
agent. Such uniform interaction fails to identify the optimal collaborators for
each agent, hindering the emergence of a stable consensus. To address these
challenges, we provide a theoretical framework for selecting optimal
collaborators that maximize consensus stability. Based on the theorems, we
propose the Belief-Calibrated Consensus Seeking (BCCS) framework to facilitate
stable consensus via selecting optimal collaborators and calibrating the
consensus judgment by system-internal beliefs. Experimental results on the MATH
and MMLU benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCCS framework
outperforms the best existing results by 2.23% and 3.95% of accuracy on
challenging tasks, respectively. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/dengwentao99/BCCS.

### [127] [Off-Trajectory Reasoning: Can LLMs Collaborate on Reasoning Trajectory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06410)
*Aochong Oliver Li,Tanya Goyal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现，标准单模型推理训练无法产生良好的离轨迹推理能力，即模型难以从其他模型的错误推理中恢复或基于正确推理继续思考。更强的模型在基准测试中表现更好，但在干扰下更脆弱，所有模型都无法有效利用协作推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索推理LLMs是否能够有效协作，即在共享推理轨迹中评估和利用其他模型的思考过程，这对于多模型协作推理至关重要。

Method: 提出双测试方法：可恢复性测试模型从误导推理中回溯的能力，可引导性测试模型基于更强协作者的正确推理继续思考的能力。评估了15个开源LLMs（1.5B-32B），并分析了蒸馏教师选择、RL使用和数据选择策略的影响。

Result: 反直觉发现：基准测试中更强的LLMs在干扰下更脆弱；所有模型在超出自身能力的问题上利用引导步骤的解决率低于9.2%；教师模型的不佳可恢复性行为会传递给蒸馏学生。

Conclusion: 标准推理训练无法产生理想的离轨迹推理行为，需要专门训练原生强推理协作者。这项工作为评估多模型协作推理奠定了基础，并揭示了现成推理LLMs的局限性。

Abstract: Reasoning LLMs are trained to verbalize their reasoning process, yielding
strong gains on complex tasks. This transparency also opens a promising
direction: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking
within a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and
exploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the
usefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this
off-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can
standard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory
behaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the
off-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can
backtrack from "distractions" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and
Guidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from
stronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and
reveals a counterintuitive finding -- "stronger" LLMs on benchmarks are often
more fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively
leverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent
capabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control
studies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these
behaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data
selection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training
natively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal
recoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled
students even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,
this work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in
shared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf
reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个知识图谱，将食物与健康联系起来，重点关注类黄酮含量与癌症的关系，使用KNARM方法在机器可操作的格式中表示这些关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前很少有研究使用语义网以标准化、机器可读的格式表示食物与健康之间的关系，这限制了有效利用这些知识的能力。

Method: 利用USDA数据库中的类黄酮含量数据和文献中的癌症关联信息，采用KNARM方法构建知识图谱，将来自不同平台的信息整合。

Result: 成功创建了一个知识图谱，能够有效表示食物与健康之间的复杂关系，为研究人员探索饮食选择与疾病管理提供了工具。

Conclusion: 该知识图谱为研究人员提供了一个示例，未来工作将扩展图谱范围，捕捉更多细节，添加相关数据，并通过推理揭示隐藏关系。

Abstract: The focus on "food as medicine" is gaining traction in the field of health
and several studies conducted in the past few years discussed this aspect of
food in the literature. However, very little research has been done on
representing the relationship between food and health in a standardized,
machine-readable format using a semantic web that can help us leverage this
knowledge effectively. To address this gap, this study aims to create a
knowledge graph to link food and health through the knowledge graph's ability
to combine information from various platforms focusing on flavonoid contents of
food found in the USDA databases and cancer connections found in the
literature. We looked closely at these relationships using KNARM methodology
and represented them in machine-operable format. The proposed knowledge graph
serves as an example for researchers, enabling them to explore the complex
interplay between dietary choices and disease management. Future work for this
study involves expanding the scope of the knowledge graph by capturing nuances,
adding more related data, and performing inferences on the acquired knowledge
to uncover hidden relationships.

Conclusion: PuzzlePlex能够进行针对性评估，并为未来基础模型在推理、规划和泛化方面的改进提供指导。

Abstract: This work investigates the reasoning and planning capabilities of foundation
models and their scalability in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce
PuzzlePlex, a benchmark designed to assess these capabilities through a diverse
set of puzzles. PuzzlePlex consists of 15 types of puzzles, including
deterministic and stochastic games of varying difficulty, as well as
single-player and two-player scenarios. The PuzzlePlex framework provides a
comprehensive environment for each game, and supports extensibility to generate
more challenging instances as foundation models evolve. Additionally, we
implement customized game-playing strategies for comparison. Building on this
benchmark, we develop fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an in-depth analysis of frontier foundation models across two settings:
instruction-based and code-based. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
their scaling limits. Our findings show that reasoning models outperform others
in instruction-based settings, while code-based execution presents greater
challenges but offers a scalable and efficient alternative. PuzzlePlex enables
targeted evaluation and guides future improvements in reasoning, planning, and
generalization for foundation models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了行为引导技术，通过识别四种有益推理行为（信息验证、权威评估、自适应搜索、错误恢复）来训练更有效的智能搜索模型，在多个基准测试中取得超过35%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能搜索利用LLMs解释复杂用户信息需求并执行多步骤搜索过程，这对LLMs的推理和智能能力提出了独特挑战。需要研究有效的推理行为模式来提升智能搜索性能。

Method: 提出推理驱动的LLM管道分析成功搜索轨迹，识别四种有益推理行为，然后通过行为引导技术合成展现这些行为的轨迹，通过监督微调和强化学习训练模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试（GAIA、WebWalker、HLE）上，行为引导使Llama3.2-3B和Qwen3-1.7B相比直接RL训练获得超过35%的性能提升。SFT数据中的期望推理行为（而非最终答案正确性）是获得强最终性能的关键因素。

Conclusion: 引入的推理行为赋予模型更有效的探索能力和测试时扩展能力，为强化学习提供了坚实基础。期望推理行为比答案正确性对最终性能更重要。

Abstract: Agentic search leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret complex
user information needs and execute a multi-step process of planning, searching,
and synthesizing information to provide answers. This paradigm introduces
unique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting
with retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a
reasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior
patterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic
search trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:
Information Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error
Recovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior
Priming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic
search trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into
the agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by
standard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,
WebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in
Llama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models
with RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the
SFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical
factor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on
trajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to
better performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our
analysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning
behaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and
entropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a
strong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE)框架，通过自动学习评估维度来提升LLM评判者的可靠性，在零样本设置下将GPT-4o在Reward Bench上的协议率从87.2%提升到90.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评判者经常遗漏关键评估维度，因为它们无法识别人类评估背后的隐含标准，导致评估可靠性不足。

Method: 提出自适应框架APE，自动从失败案例中学习评估维度，采用基于置信度的集成机制，通过Collective Confidence方法决定何时采用额外评估维度的判断。

Result: 广泛实验表明APE显著提升了LLM评判者在多样化标准基准上的可靠性，特别是在Reward Bench上实现了协议率的显著提升。

Conclusion: APE为LLM评判者提供了一种原则性方法，能够利用测试时计算，弥合人类与LLM评判者之间的评估差距。

Abstract: We present a novel framework that improves the reliability of LLM judges by
selectively augmenting LLM with auxiliary evaluation dimensions. Existing LLM
judges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize
the implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,
we propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that
automatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE
incorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the
judgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence
estimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse
standard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward
Bench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a
principled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge
the evaluation gap between human and LLM judges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WebDART是一个通用框架，通过动态任务分解和持续重规划，使单个大语言模型能够处理复杂的网页任务，在WebChoreArena上比之前最先进代理的成功率提高了13.7个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在简单网页任务上表现良好，但在需要长视野导航、大规模信息提取和约束下推理的复杂目标上仍然存在困难。

Method: WebDART框架：(i) 将每个目标动态分解为导航、信息提取和执行三个专注子任务；(ii) 随着新网页的揭示持续重规划分解，利用新发现的过滤器或捷径，避免冗余探索。

Result: 在WebChoreArena上，WebDART比之前最先进代理的成功率提高了13.7个百分点，在WebArena套件上性能相当，完成任务所需的导航步骤最多减少14.7步。

Conclusion: WebDART通过动态任务分解和持续重规划，显著提升了LLM代理处理复杂网页任务的能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming competent at straightforward
web tasks, such as opening an item page or submitting a form, but still
struggle with objectives that require long horizon navigation, large scale
information extraction, and reasoning under constraints. We present WebDART, a
general framework that enables a single LLM to handle such complex chores.
WebDART (i) dynamically decomposes each objective into three focused subtasks:
navigation, information extraction, and execution, so the model concentrates on
one skill at a time, and (ii) continuously replans the decomposition as new
webpages are revealed, taking advantage of newly discovered filters or
shortcuts and avoiding redundant exploration. Evaluated on WebChoreArena,
WebDART lifts success rates by up to 13.7 percentage points over previous SOTA
agents, while matching their performance on the easier WebArena suite and
completing tasks with up to 14.7 fewer navigation steps.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了情感上下文学习(EICL)方法，通过引入情感相似的示例和动态软标签策略来改进细粒度情感识别中的决策过程，显著优于传统上下文学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习的方法虽然增强了推理过程，但忽视了决策过程。语义相似的示例往往会引入情感差异，阻碍准确的情感表示并导致错误。

Method: 提出EICL方法：1)引入情感相似的示例；2)使用动态软标签策略改进查询表示；3)采用两阶段排除策略从多角度评估相似性，优化决策过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EICL方法显著优于传统的上下文学习方法。

Conclusion: 基于原型理论，通过关注情感相似性和改进决策过程，EICL能够有效提升细粒度情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in
queries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role
in various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the
representation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar
examples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the
reasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but
overlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making
in fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL
relies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional
prototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are
critical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional
discrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To
address this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces
emotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve
query representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion
strategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further
optimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL
significantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.

Motivation: 标准离线方法依赖批量标注，无法实时改进客服系统。需要将人类反馈直接嵌入到运营工作流中，实现持续优化。

Method: AITL框架在实时客服操作中集成四种标注：响应偏好对比、客服采纳与理由、知识相关性检查、缺失知识识别。

Abstract: We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a
continuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer
support system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch
annotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live
customer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and
rationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing
knowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,
reducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving
US-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality
(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore
the effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational
workflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着元代理被用于自动化设计代理系统，需要解决其在学习效率、行为多样性和经济可行性方面的实际挑战。

Method: 通过实验比较不同学习策略（如扩展上下文vs进化方法），评估代理行为多样性，并分析自动化设计的经济成本效益。

Result: 发现进化方法优于简单扩展上下文；设计的代理行为多样性低；仅在少数数据集上自动化设计具有经济优势。

Conclusion: 当前元代理方法在跨迭代学习、行为多样性和经济可行性方面仍存在显著局限，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using
meta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In
this paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.
First, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that
simply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous
works, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the
performance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the
meta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a
single agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral
diversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess
when automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few
cases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying
the agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over
15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not
justify the design cost, regardless of scale.

Conclusion: 该知识图谱在个性化医疗、认知障碍诊断和认知神经科学假设制定方面具有重要应用价值，为从分子到行为领域提供了统一的多层次视角。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the integration
of knowledge graphs (KGs) in biomedical and cognitive sciences, overcoming
limitations in traditional machine learning methods for capturing intricate
semantic links among genes, diseases, and cognitive processes. We introduce
MultiCNKG, an innovative framework that merges three key knowledge sources: the
Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graph (CNKG) with 2.9K nodes and 4.3K edges
across 9 node types and 20 edge types; Gene Ontology (GO) featuring 43K nodes
and 75K edges in 3 node types and 4 edge types; and Disease Ontology (DO)
comprising 11.2K nodes and 8.8K edges with 1 node type and 2 edge types.
Leveraging LLMs like GPT-4, we conduct entity alignment, semantic similarity
computation, and graph augmentation to create a cohesive KG that interconnects
genetic mechanisms, neurological disorders, and cognitive functions. The
resulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,
Diseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,
Associated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular
to behavioral domains. Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),
recall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty
detection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and
coherence. Link prediction evaluations with models like TransE (MR: 391, MRR:
0.411) and RotatE (MR: 263, MRR: 0.395) show competitive performance against
benchmarks like FB15k-237 and WN18RR. This KG advances applications in
personalized medicine, cognitive disorder diagnostics, and hypothesis
formulation in cognitive neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在顺序决策任务中的应用日益增多，需要确保这些基于LLM的策略能够满足安全性要求，但目前缺乏系统性的验证方法。

Method: 给定MDP、LLM策略和PCTL安全要求，增量构建可达状态空间，将状态编码为自然语言提示，解析LLM响应为动作，扩展可达后继状态，最后使用Storm模型检查器验证策略是否满足安全属性。

Result: 在标准网格世界基准测试中，通过Ollama访问的开源LLM在确定性种子下可以被验证，但通常表现不如深度强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: 该工具与Ollama原生集成并支持PRISM规范任务，为形式化验证日益强大的LLM奠定了实用基础，支持用户指定顺序决策任务的持续基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce a tool for rigorous and automated verification of large language
model (LLM)- based policies in memoryless sequential decision-making tasks.
Given a Markov decision process (MDP) representing the sequential
decision-making task, an LLM policy, and a safety requirement expressed as a
PCTL formula, our approach incrementally constructs only the reachable portion
of the MDP guided by the LLM's chosen actions. Each state is encoded as a
natural language prompt, the LLM's response is parsed into an action, and
reachable successor states by the policy are expanded. The resulting formal
model is checked with Storm to determine whether the policy satisfies the
specified safety property. In experiments on standard grid world benchmarks, we
show that open source LLMs accessed via Ollama can be verified when
deterministically seeded, but generally underperform deep reinforcement
learning baselines. Our tool natively integrates with Ollama and supports
PRISM-specified tasks, enabling continuous benchmarking in user-specified
sequential decision-making tasks and laying a practical foundation for formally
verifying increasingly capable LLMs.

Abstract: Automating the end-to-end scientific research process poses a fundamental

address this bilevel challenge, we propose a novel Double-Loop Multi-Agent

It employs an evolutionary algorithm through involvement, improvement, and

composed of doctoral student agents, is responsible for executing the
best-evolved plan. It dynamically adjusts the plan during implementation via
pre-hoc and post-hoc meetings, ensuring each step (e.g., drafting, coding) is
well-supported by contextual and external observations. Extensive experiments
on benchmarks like ACLAward and Laboratory show that DLMA generates research
papers that achieve state-of-the-art scores in automated evaluation,
significantly outperforming strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm the
critical roles of both loops, with evolution driving novelty and execution
ensuring soundness.

TL;DR: 提出了ATF方法，通过集成语法检查和一致性验证工具来改进自动形式化，显著提升了形式化陈述的语法有效性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有形式化方法在生成语法有效且语义一致的形式化陈述方面仍存在困难，需要改进自动形式化的质量。

Method: ATF方法整合Lean 4编译器进行语法校正，采用多LLM判断进行一致性验证，通过工具反馈自适应优化生成结果。训练包括冷启动、专家迭代和直接偏好优化三个阶段。

Result: 实验表明ATF显著优于基线模型，人类评估进一步验证其优越性能，且展现出良好的推理扩展特性。

Conclusion: ATF通过工具反馈机制有效提升了自动形式化的质量，开源了Numina-ATF数据集促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Autoformalization addresses the scarcity of data for Automated Theorem
Proving (ATP) by translating mathematical problems from natural language into
formal statements. Efforts in recent work shift from directly prompting large
language models to training an end-to-end formalizer model from scratch,
achieving remarkable advancements. However, existing formalizer still struggles
to consistently generate valid statements that meet syntactic validity and
semantic consistency. To address this issue, we propose the Autoformalizer with
Tool Feedback (ATF), a novel approach that incorporates syntactic and
consistency information as tools into the formalization process. By integrating
Lean 4 compilers for syntax corrections and employing a multi-LLMs-as-judge
approach for consistency validation, the model is able to adaptively refine
generated statements according to the tool feedback, enhancing both syntactic
validity and semantic consistency. The training of ATF involves a cold-start
phase on synthetic tool-calling data, an expert iteration phase to improve
formalization capabilities, and Direct Preference Optimization to alleviate
ineffective revisions. Experimental results show that ATF markedly outperforms
a range of baseline formalizer models, with its superior performance further
validated by human evaluations. Subsequent analysis reveals that ATF
demonstrates excellent inference scaling properties. Moreover, we open-source
Numina-ATF, a dataset containing 750K synthetic formal statements to facilitate
advancements in autoformalization and ATP research.

*Daria Ozerova,Ekaterina Trofimova*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR)框架，结合GRPO和基于Thompson采样的树搜索，用于改进大语言模型的迭代精炼过程，在代码调试任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代精炼方法依赖预定义启发式规则，面临探索-利用困境，且无法根据过去的精炼结果进行自适应调整。

Method: TGPR框架结合GRPO和基于Thompson采样的树搜索，主动探索失败和成功的精炼路径，提供更密集的训练轨迹和更自适应的策略。

Result: 在HumanEval、MBPP和APPS基准测试中，相比GRPO基线，pass@1在MBPP上提升4.2个百分点，pass@10在APPS上提升12.51个百分点。

Conclusion: TGPR为结合学习策略和结构化搜索方法提供了原则性方法，是增强LLMs迭代精炼和状态推理的通用框架。

Abstract: Iterative refinement has been a promising paradigm to enable large language
models (LLMs) to resolve difficult reasoning and problem-solving tasks. One of
the key challenges, however, is how to effectively search through the enormous
search space of possible refinements. Existing methods typically fall back on
predefined heuristics, which are troubled by the exploration-exploitation
dilemma and cannot adapt based on past refinement outcomes. We introduce
Tree-Guided Policy Refinement (TGPR), a novel framework that combines GRPO with
a Thompson-Sampling-based tree search. TGPR explores both failed and successful
refinement paths actively, with denser training trajectories and more adaptive
policies. On HumanEval, MBPP, and APPS benchmarks, our method achieves up to
+4.2 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@1 (on MBPP) and up to
+12.51 percentage points absolute improvement in pass@10 (on APPS) compared to
a competitive GRPO baseline. Apart from debugging code, TGPR focuses on a
principled approach to combining learned policies with structured search
methods, offering a general framework for enhancing iterative refinement and
stateful reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成开发环境，用于简化AJAN多智能体系统中基于RDF/RDFS和SPARQL的智能体行为建模，并利用大型语言模型扩展用户群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AJAN框架虽然支持基于语义Web标准的多智能体系统开发，但RDF/RDFS和SPARQL的复杂使用（如URI处理和复杂查询）在实践中存在很大障碍，限制了框架的广泛应用。

Method: 开发了一个集成开发环境，通过简化RDF/RDFS和SPARQL的使用来降低建模难度，并整合大型语言模型来辅助智能体工程。

Result: 该IDE降低了AJAN智能体建模的技术门槛，使非专家用户也能更容易地使用该框架。

Conclusion: 提出的集成开发环境有效解决了AJAN框架在实际应用中的技术障碍，通过结合大型语言模型扩展了用户群体，促进了多智能体系统的开发。

Abstract: There are many established semantic Web standards for implementing
multi-agent driven applications. The AJAN framework allows to engineer
multi-agent systems based on these standards. In particular, agent knowledge is
represented in RDF/RDFS and OWL, while agent behavior models are defined with
Behavior Trees and SPARQL to access and manipulate this knowledge. However, the
appropriate definition of RDF/RDFS and SPARQL-based agent behaviors still
remains a major hurdle not only for agent modelers in practice. For example,
dealing with URIs is very error-prone regarding typos and dealing with complex
SPARQL queries in large-scale environments requires a high learning curve. In
this paper, we present an integrated development environment to overcome such
hurdles of modeling AJAN agents and at the same time to extend the user
community for AJAN by the possibility to leverage Large Language Models for
agent engineering.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究验证了统一信息密度(UID)假设在大型语言模型推理追踪中的应用，发现步骤级信息密度均匀性可作为推理质量的强预测指标，通过选择信息密度更均匀的推理路径可显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视统一信息密度原则在LLM推理追踪中的适用性，探究步骤级信息密度均匀性是否反映推理质量。

Method: 提出基于熵的步骤级信息密度度量方法，引入局部和全局均匀性评分两个互补的均匀性衡量指标。

Result: 在六个推理基准测试中，步骤级均匀性不仅提供理论视角，还带来实际性能提升：选择信息密度更均匀的推理路径在AIME2025上相对基线提升准确率10-32%。正确推理路径避免信息密度尖峰，错误路径则呈现不规则信息爆发。

Conclusion: UID启发的信息密度度量优于其他内部信号作为推理质量预测指标，信息密度均匀性可作为构建更可靠准确推理系统的稳健诊断和选择标准。

Abstract: The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective
communication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit
this principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,
asking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,
we propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce
two complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.
Across the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that
step-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also
yields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces
with more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by
10-32\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals
that correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,
while incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results
demonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform
alternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results
highlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and
selection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅依赖直接推理的语言模型在处理需要最新知识或计算工具（如计算器、代码解释器）的复杂算术运算任务时仍存在困难。

Method: 采用改进的动态采样策略优化（DAPO）强化学习框架，专门针对工具调用场景进行适配，使模型能够动态地在复杂推理与按需工具使用之间切换。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B和Qwen2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，该方法在需要外部知识和数学计算的任务上实现了最先进性能，比基线方法具有更高效的工具利用率。

Conclusion: 结合高级推理与工具使用在知识密集型和计算密集型任务中具有显著潜力，能够有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have popularized test-time
scaling, where models generate additional reasoning tokens before producing
final answers. These approaches have demonstrated significant performance
improvements on benchmarks involving mathematical reasoning. However, language
models relying solely on direct inference still struggle with tasks demanding
up-to-date knowledge or computational tools such as calculators and code
interpreters for complex arithmetic operations. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Tool-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel reinforcement
learning framework that systematically integrates multi-hop reasoning with
adaptive tool-calling capabilities. Our approach employs a modified version of
Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), a recently developed RL paradigm,
which we adapt specifically for tool invocation scenarios, enabling models to
dynamically interleave complex reasoning with on-demand tool usage (including
search APIs and Python interpreters).
  To support this research, we introduce two new datasets: TAPO-easy-60K and
TAPO-hard-18K, specifically designed to train and evaluate both fact-based
reasoning and mathematical calculation capabilities. Our experiments on
Qwen2.5-3B and Qwen2.5-7B models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
with both models achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring
external knowledge and mathematical computation among methods with comparable
parameters. Notably, TAPO achieves more efficient tool utilization than
baseline methods while preventing excessive calls caused by reward hacking.
These results highlight the significant potential of combining advanced
reasoning with tool usage to enhance model performance in knowledge-intensive
and computationally demanding tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架成功构建了能够捕捉人类群体多样性的LLM代理集合，为使用LLM作为人类行为代理提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: The difficulty and expense of obtaining large-scale human responses make
Large Language Models (LLMs) an attractive alternative and a promising proxy
for human behavior. However, prior work shows that LLMs often produce
homogeneous outputs that fail to capture the rich diversity of human
perspectives and behaviors. Thus, rather than trying to capture this diversity
with a single LLM agent, we propose a novel framework to construct a set of
agents that collectively capture the diversity of a given human population.
Each agent is an LLM whose behavior is steered by conditioning on a small set
of human demonstrations (task-response pairs) through in-context learning. The
central challenge is therefore to select a representative set of LLM agents
from the exponentially large space of possible agents. We tackle this selection
problem from the lens of submodular optimization. In particular, we develop
methods that offer different trade-offs regarding time complexity and
performance guarantees. Extensive experiments in crowdsourcing and educational
domains demonstrate that our approach constructs agents that more effectively
represent human populations compared to baselines. Moreover, behavioral
analyses on new tasks show that these agents reproduce the behavior patterns
and perspectives of the students and annotators they are designed to represent.

Conclusion: 成功开发了可能性逻辑程序的归纳推理方法，验证了所提算法在普通逻辑程序上的优越性能。

Abstract: Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major
variant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic
stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of
inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an
approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples
(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of
induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and
two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are
presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental
results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype
outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from
stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.

Conclusion: VRPAgent是首个在VRP领域推进技术前沿的基于LLM的范式，为自动化启发式发现展示了有前景的未来。

Abstract: Designing high-performing heuristics for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is a
complex task that requires both intuition and deep domain knowledge. Large
language model (LLM)-based code generation has recently shown promise across
many domains, but it still falls short of producing heuristics that rival those
crafted by human experts. In this paper, we propose VRPAgent, a framework that
integrates LLM-generated components into a metaheuristic and refines them
through a novel genetic search. By using the LLM to generate problem-specific
operators, embedded within a generic metaheuristic framework, VRPAgent keeps
tasks manageable, guarantees correctness, and still enables the discovery of
novel and powerful strategies. Across multiple problems, including the
capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, and the prize-collecting VRP, our
method discovers heuristic operators that outperform handcrafted methods and
recent learning-based approaches while requiring only a single CPU core. To our
knowledge, \VRPAgent is the first LLM-based paradigm to advance the
state-of-the-art in VRPs, highlighting a promising future for automated
heuristics discovery.

Result: 在ALFWorld(~35动作)和SciWorld(~500动作)之间观察到表示选择的拐点，更强的规划能力使拐点右移，更好的模式实例化能力使拐点左移。

Conclusion: 需要可扩展的动作表示方法，为构建更强大的PwS智能体提供了实用指导，以实现更好的可扩展自主性。

Abstract: Enabling LLMs to effectively operate long-horizon task which requires
long-term planning and multiple interactions is essential for open-world
autonomy. Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable
action list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation
choice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial
exploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As
environmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation
for long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the
effectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is
conventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its
effectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas
(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., "move [OBJ]
to [OBJ]" -> "move apple to desk") to ensure concise action space and reliable
scalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human
cognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format
restriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual
framework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action
representations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection
point between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve
as evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct
controlled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point
interacts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts
the inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it
leftward. Finally, noting the suboptimal performance of PwS agents, we provide
an actionable guide for building more capable PwS agents for better scalable
autonomy.

Conclusion: 通过内在驱动的具身智能体在开放多智能体环境中学习，可以培养开放性和关怀能力，为解决人工智能的适应性和对齐问题提供新思路。

Abstract: Physical vulnerability and mortality are often seen as obstacles to be
avoided in the development of artificial agents, which struggle to adapt to
open-ended environments and provide aligned care. Meanwhile, biological
organisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical
world with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the
conditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,
adaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions
for physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin
Heidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and
being-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal
states due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these
conditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining
integrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an
intrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing
inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,
we examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,
empowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to
meet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to
maintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement
learning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven
embodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate
the capacities for open-endedness and care.ov

Conclusion: 该框架成功将领域知识整合到流程发现中，通过LLM提取规则指导模型构建，避免了与领域知识相矛盾的问题流程结构，提高了流程模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Process discovery aims to derive process models from event logs, providing
insights into operational behavior and forming a foundation for conformance
checking and process improvement. However, models derived solely from event
data may not accurately reflect the real process, as event logs are often
incomplete or affected by noise, and domain knowledge, an important
complementary resource, is typically disregarded. As a result, the discovered
models may lack reliability for downstream tasks. We propose an interactive
framework that incorporates domain knowledge, expressed in natural language,
into the process discovery pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
approach leverages LLMs to extract declarative rules from textual descriptions
provided by domain experts. These rules are used to guide the IMr discovery
algorithm, which recursively constructs process models by combining insights
from both the event log and the extracted rules, helping to avoid problematic
process structures that contradict domain knowledge. The framework coordinates
interactions among the LLM, domain experts, and a set of backend services. We
present a fully implemented tool that supports this workflow and conduct an
extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs and prompt engineering strategies. Our
empirical study includes a case study based on a real-life event log with the
involvement of domain experts, who assessed the usability and effectiveness of
the framework.

Abstract: Large language models are emerging as powerful tools for scientific law
discovery, a foundational challenge in AI-driven science. However, existing
benchmarks for this task suffer from a fundamental methodological trilemma,
forcing a trade-off between scientific relevance, scalability, and resistance
to memorization. Furthermore, they oversimplify discovery as static function
fitting, failing to capture the authentic scientific process of uncovering
embedded laws through the interactive exploration of complex model systems. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising
324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains. Our design
mitigates the evaluation trilemma by using metaphysical shifts - systematic
alterations of canonical laws - to generate a vast suite of problems that are
scalable, scientifically relevant, and memorization-resistant. Moreover, we
elevate the evaluation from static function fitting to interactive model
discovery, requiring agents to experimentally probe simulated complex systems
to uncover hidden principles. Our extensive experiment reveals a clear but
fragile capability for discovery in frontier LLMs: this ability degrades
precipitously with increasing system complexity and exhibits extreme
sensitivity to observational noise. Notably, we uncover a paradoxical effect of
tool assistance: providing a code interpreter can hinder more capable models by
inducing a premature shift from exploration to exploitation, causing them to
satisfice on suboptimal solutions. These results demonstrate that robust,
generalizable discovery in complex, interactive environments remains the core
challenge. By providing a scalable, robust, and scientifically authentic
testbed, NewtonBench offers a crucial tool for measuring true progress and
guiding the development of next-generation AI agents capable of genuine
scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 词典序框架和LCBS算法为多目标多智能体路径规划提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于目标数量较多的情况。

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios require multiple agents to coordinate in shared
environments, while balancing trade-offs between multiple, potentially
competing objectives. Current multi-objective multi-agent path finding
(MO-MAPF) algorithms typically produce conflict-free plans by computing Pareto
frontiers. They do not explicitly optimize for user-defined preferences, even
when the preferences are available, and scale poorly with the number of
objectives. We propose a lexicographic framework for modeling MO-MAPF, along
with an algorithm \textit{Lexicographic Conflict-Based Search} (LCBS) that
directly computes a single solution aligned with a lexicographic preference
over objectives. LCBS integrates a priority-aware low-level $A^*$ search with
conflict-based search, avoiding Pareto frontier construction and enabling
efficient planning guided by preference over objectives. We provide insights
into optimality and scalability, and empirically demonstrate that LCBS computes
optimal solutions while scaling to instances with up to ten objectives -- far
beyond the limits of existing MO-MAPF methods. Evaluations on standard and
randomized MAPF benchmarks show consistently higher success rates against
state-of-the-art baselines, especially with increasing number of objectives.

Abstract: Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and
management. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we
demonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and
analysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than
traditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user
query as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the
underlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved
through carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95
percent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10
minutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational
efficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and
engaging storylines.
