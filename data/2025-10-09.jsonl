Of interest here is the Stein exponent,\ni.e. the largest rate of decay (in $n$) of the type II error probability for a\nvanishingly small type I error probability. When the hypotheses are simple and\ni.i.d., the Chernoff-Stein lemma states that this is given by the relative\nentropy between the single-copy probability distributions. Generalisations of\nthis result exist in the case of composite hypotheses, but mostly to settings\nwhere the probability distribution of $X^n$ is not genuinely correlated, but\nrather, e.g., a convex combination of product distributions with components\ntaken from a base set. Here, we establish a general Chernoff-Stein lemma that\napplies to the setting where both hypotheses are composite and genuinely\ncorrelated, satisfying only generic assumptions such as convexity (on both\nhypotheses) and some weak form of permutational symmetry (on either\nhypothesis). Our result, which strictly subsumes most prior work, is proved\nusing a refinement of the blurring technique developed in the context of the\ngeneralised quantum Stein's lemma [Lami, IEEE Trans. Inf.

The\nsecond part of the work is devoted to applications: we provide a single-letter\nformula for the Stein exponent characterising the discrimination of broad\nfamilies of null hypotheses vs a composite i.i.d. or an arbitrarily varying\nalternative hypothesis, and establish a 'constrained de Finetti reduction'\nstatement that covers a wide family of convex constraints.

It is mostly depicted that it is possible\nin a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after\nreaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate\ndata science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new\ntechnique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,\nagility and iterative approach to business processes."}

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR\nperforms a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained\nautoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,\ndata-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences\nautoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens\nwithin each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive\nexperiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient\nthan masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.\nBuilding on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion\nwith minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel\ngeneration. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures\nconfirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger\nrobustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups\nwithout accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning\nand domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on\nchallenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and\ngains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting\nand pass@k.

These tasks align with building digital twins\nof highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively\nunderstood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI\nmodels with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge\nextends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these\nsettings before assuming broader decision-making roles.\n  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient\nself-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual\nlimits in overcoming it.

Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery.

It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL).

Conventional methods adopt planning with actions where a executable\naction list would be provided as reference. However, this action representation\nchoice would be impractical when the environment action space is combinatorial\nexploded (e.g., open-ended real world). This naturally leads to a question: As\nenvironmental action space scales, what is the optimal action representation\nfor long-horizon agents? In this paper, we systematically study the\neffectiveness of two different action representations. The first one is\nconventional planning with actions (PwA) which is predominantly adopted for its\neffectiveness on existing benchmarks. The other one is planning with schemas\n(PwS) which instantiate an action schema into action lists (e.g., \"move [OBJ]\nto [OBJ]\" -> \"move apple to desk\") to ensure concise action space and reliable\nscalability. This alternative is motivated by its alignment with human\ncognition and its compliance with environment-imposed action format\nrestriction. We propose cognitive bandwidth perspective as a conceptual\nframework to qualitatively understand the differences between these two action\nrepresentations and empirically observe a representation-choice inflection\npoint between ALFWorld (~35 actions) and SciWorld (~500 actions), which serve\nas evidence of the need for scalable representations. We further conduct\ncontrolled experiments to study how the location of this inflection point\ninteracts with different model capacities: stronger planning proficiency shifts\nthe inflection rightward, whereas better schema instantiation shifts it\nleftward.

To\naddress these critical gaps, we introduce NewtonBench, a benchmark comprising\n324 scientific law discovery tasks across 12 physics domains.

In this work, we evaluate whether\nthis architectural innovation is sufficient to perform \"zero-shot\nsuper-resolution,\" namely to enable a model to serve inference on\nhigher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We\ncomprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution\n(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution\ninference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency\ninformation; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.\nConsequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at\nresolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they\nare brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we\npropose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution\ntraining protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust\nmulti-resolution generalization."}

Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing\nmultiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for\nsuch problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in\nthis field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge\ncomputing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces the \\textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural\nNetwork-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a\nnew detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather\nthan reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike\nTime-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural\nactivity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also\nproposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,\nassigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a\nsingle spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to\nconventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available\ndatasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance\nwhile significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep\nlearning and machine learning baselines.

However, stateless inference often struggles on\nmulti-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,\ntask-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level\ncode generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and\nlong-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate\nits effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of\nedge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,\nwhere specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A\ncontroller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary\npreservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This\nyields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge\ncases across unseen codebases.

In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly\ncrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which\nleads to a time invariant optimal policy.

This paradigm introduces\nunique challenges for LLMs' reasoning and agentic capabilities when interacting\nwith retrieval systems and the broader web. In this paper, we propose a\nreasoning-driven LLM-based pipeline to study effective reasoning behavior\npatterns in agentic search. Using this pipeline, we analyze successful agentic\nsearch trajectories and identify four beneficial reasoning behaviors:\nInformation Verification, Authority Evaluation, Adaptive Search, and Error\nRecovery. Based on these findings, we propose a technique called Behavior\nPriming to train more effective agentic search models. It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on three benchmarks (GAIA,\nWebWalker, and HLE) demonstrate that behavior priming yields over 35% gains in\nLlama3.2-3B and Qwen3-1.7B compared to directly training agentic search models\nwith RL. Crucially, we demonstrate that the desired reasoning behaviors in the\nSFT data, rather than the correctness of the final answer, is the critical\nfactor for achieving strong final performance after RL: fine-tuning on\ntrajectories with desirable reasoning behaviors but incorrect answers leads to\nbetter performance than fine-tuning on trajectories with correct answers. Our\nanalysis further reveals the underlying mechanism: the introduced reasoning\nbehaviors endow models with more effective exploration (higher pass@k and\nentropy) and test-time scaling (longer trajectories) capabilities, providing a\nstrong foundation for RL. Our code will be released as open source."}

Existing LLM\njudges often miss crucial evaluation dimensions because they fail to recognize\nthe implicit standards underlying human assessments. To address this challenge,\nwe propose the Auto-Prompt Ensemble (APE), an adaptive framework that\nautomatically learns evaluation dimensions from its failure cases. APE\nincorporates a confidence-based ensemble mechanism to decide when to adopt the\njudgments from additional evaluation dimensions through a novel confidence\nestimation approach called Collective Confidence. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that APE improves the reliability of LLM Judge across diverse\nstandard benchmarks. For instance, APE enhances GPT-4o agreement rate on Reward\nBench from 87.2% to 90.5% in the zero-shot setting. Overall, APE provides a\nprincipled approach for LLM Judge to leverage test-time computation, and bridge\nthe evaluation gap between human and LLM judges."}

In\nthis paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.\nFirst, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that\nsimply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous\nworks, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the\nperformance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the\nmeta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a\nsingle agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral\ndiversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess\nwhen automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few\ncases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying\nthe agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over\n15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not\njustify the design cost, regardless of scale."}

The\nresulting MultiCNKG encompasses 6.9K nodes across 5 types (e.g., Genes,\nDiseases, Cognitive Processes) and 11.3K edges spanning 7 types (e.g., Causes,\nAssociated with, Regulates), facilitating a multi-layered view from molecular\nto behavioral domains.

Despite achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance, these methods remain hindered by the prohibitive storage overhead\nand excessive training time, due to the massive scale of the database and the\ncomputational burden of intensive message passing across interconnected tables.\nTo alleviate these concerns, we propose and study the problem of Relational\nDatabase Distillation (RDD). Specifically, we aim to distill large-scale RDBs\ninto compact heterogeneous graphs while retaining the predictive power (i.e.,\nutility) required for training graph-based models. Multi-modal column\ninformation is preserved through node features, and primary-foreign key\nrelations are encoded via heterogeneous edges, thereby maintaining both data\nfidelity and relational structure. To ensure adaptability across diverse\ndownstream tasks without engaging the traditional, inefficient bi-level\ndistillation framework, we further design a kernel ridge regression-guided\nobjective with pseudo-labels, which produces quality features for the distilled\ngraph.

Meanwhile, biological\norganisms survive, thrive, and care for each other in an open-ended physical\nworld with relative ease and efficiency. Understanding the role of the\nconditions of life in this disparity can aid in developing more robust,\nadaptive, and caring artificial agents. Here we define two minimal conditions\nfor physical embodiment inspired by the existentialist phenomenology of Martin\nHeidegger: being-in-the-world (the agent is a part of the environment) and\nbeing-towards-death (unless counteracted, the agent drifts toward terminal\nstates due to the second law of thermodynamics). We propose that from these\nconditions we can obtain both a homeostatic drive - aimed at maintaining\nintegrity and avoiding death by expending energy to learn and act - and an\nintrinsic drive to continue to do so in as many ways as possible. Drawing\ninspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's existentialist concept of will-to-power,\nwe examine how intrinsic drives to maximize control over future states, e.g.,\nempowerment, allow agents to increase the probability that they will be able to\nmeet their future homeostatic needs, thereby enhancing their capacity to\nmaintain physical integrity. We formalize these concepts within a reinforcement\nlearning framework, which enables us to examine how intrinsically driven\nembodied agents learning in open-ended multi-agent environments may cultivate\nthe capacities for open-endedness and care.ov"}
