Existing\napproaches typically follow the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) paradigm:\nfirst retrieving subgraphs relevant to the query and then generating answers\nconditioned on the retrieved subgraphs. However, such two-phase pipelines often\nstruggle to faithfully incorporate graph structure, since the generation\nprocess is ultimately constrained by the quality and completeness of the\nretrieved subgraph. Although many advanced retrievers have been proposed\nrecently to mitigate this issue, they are usually tailored to the training\ngraphs and generalize poorly to unseen graphs, which limits their practical\napplicability. In this work, we propose Reasoning by Exploration (RoE), a novel\napproach that unifies retrieval and generation by framing reasoning over graphs\nas a process of graph exploration. At each step, the LLM selects candidate\nnodes and edges to explore, gradually constructing reasoning paths and\ngenerating answers along the way. To enable effective exploration, RoE is\ntrained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on gold reasoning paths,\nfollowed by reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance exploration effectiveness\nand generalization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RoE\nachieves substantial overall improvements over baselines, while also\ngeneralizing effectively to unseen graphs."}

With respect to the\nparameterized complexity, we consider the temporal graph parameters\nvertex-interval-membership-width $(vimw)$ and interval-membership-width\n$(imw)$. We show that all considered problems admit FPT-algorithms when\nparameterized by $vimw + k+\\ell$. This provides a smaller parameter combination\nthan the ones used for previously known FPT-algorithms for \\textsc{Timeline\nVertex Cover}. Surprisingly, for $imw+ k+\\ell$, \\textsc{Timeline Dominating\nSet} turns out to be easier than \\textsc{Timeline Vertex Cover}, by also\nadmitting an FPT-algorithm, whereas the vertex cover version is NP-hard even if\n$imw+\\, k+\\ell$ is constant.

As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making.

Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test\ntime transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard\nevaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on\nbenchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving\nrelative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16\ndataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM\nconsistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of\ncompositional reasoning."}

As a\nresult, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators\nor simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,\nand routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with\nboth reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external\nto the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language\nby internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the\nvocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but\nmay trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.\nFrom there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive\nfeedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a\nresult. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new\nenvironments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with\ncounterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions\nand contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with\nvocabulary-constrained actions.

At\nits core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a\nhigh-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline\nverifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning\nsteps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data\nfiltering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate\npolicy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster\nprogressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search\nbenchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and\nrelevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming\nSFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and\nrobustness."}

Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a\nnon-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized\nmini-batch SGD ($\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{c\\beta}{c\\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in\ncentralized and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{2c\\beta}{2c\\beta +2}}/{n\nm^{\\frac{1}{2c\\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the\nfirst unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,\nnode count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the\ngeneralization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients\nassumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.\nFinally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical\nfindings."}

To address this, the\nDivide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training\ndata into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.\nThis strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the\ninfluence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation\ntypically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like\ndata size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying\ngeneralization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization.

When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear\nmode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width\nensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance\nof finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,\neven without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for\nachieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further\nexplain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.\nSpecifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity\n(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be\nrepresented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the\ncorresponding layers of the original models.

Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a\nnon-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized\nmini-batch SGD ($\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{c\\beta}{c\\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in\ncentralized and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{2c\\beta}{2c\\beta +2}}/{n\nm^{\\frac{1}{2c\\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the\nfirst unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity,\nnode count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the\ngeneralization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients\nassumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training.\nFinally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical\nfindings."}

To\novercome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit\ncardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these\ndependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven\ncardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw\ndata access, query logs, or retraining on the target database.

However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,\nprincipally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising\navenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly\nreal-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly\ncomplex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and\nflow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or\npolicy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability\nto larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to\ndevelop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or\nbackpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for\nOffline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that\nintegrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns\nan optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At\ninference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection\nsampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient\noptimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.\nEmpirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of\noffline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value\nlearning into offline RL."}

We introduce\nClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces\ntransparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.\n  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov\nDecision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from\nlegal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and\nused both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural\nlanguage justifications.\n  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,\nClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance\nby 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded\nexplanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.\n  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision\nand explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and\nregulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and\nthe EU AI Act."}

Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test\ntime transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard\nevaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables\nSigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first\nresult surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.\n  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,\nself-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any\nexternal supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for\nexample, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a\nnew state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on\nbenchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving\nrelative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16\ndataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM\nconsistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of\ncompositional reasoning."}

These previous works have found that language\nmodel embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they\ndo not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as\ncontinuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear\nreconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models\nnot only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce\nsignificant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google\nGemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high\nfidelity ($R^2 \\geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of\nvariation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components\nwithin the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.\nFurther, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with\nincreasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space\nbeing fundamentally unchanged.

Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models\noutperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms\nthem when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been\ninterpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We\nargue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric\noutputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success\nin the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can\ntherefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of\nproblems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of\ncompletions are correct.

The\nproposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a\nsingle prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row\npairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to\noptimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the\nsize of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size).

When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack\nfine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or\ntree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical\nlinks. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share\ninformation across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space\ndiversity.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods."}
