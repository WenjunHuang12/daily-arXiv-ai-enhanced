This problem is extremely well-studied and a nearly-optimal\n$\\widetilde{O}(d \\log n)$ query algorithm is known due to\nHopkins-Kane-Lovett-Mahajan (FOCS 2020). However, their algorithm is granted\nthe power to query arbitrary points outside of $X$ (point synthesis), and in\nfact without this power there is an $\\Omega(n)$ query lower bound due to\nDasgupta (NeurIPS 2004).\n  In this work our goal is to design efficient algorithms for learning\nhalfspaces without point synthesis. To circumvent the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound,\nwe consider learning halfspaces whose normal vectors come from a set of size\n$D$, and show tight bounds of $\\Theta(D + \\log n)$. As a corollary, we obtain\nan optimal $O(d + \\log n)$ query deterministic learner for axis-aligned\nhalfspaces, closing a previous gap of $O(d \\log n)$ vs. $\\Omega(d + \\log n)$.\nIn fact, our algorithm solves the more general problem of learning a Boolean\nfunction $f$ over $n$ elements which is monotone under at least one of $D$\nprovided orderings. Our technical insight is to exploit the structure in these\norderings to perform a binary search in parallel rather than considering each\nordering sequentially, and we believe our approach may be of broader interest.\n  Furthermore, we use our exact learning algorithm to obtain nearly optimal\nalgorithms for PAC-learning. We show that $O(\\min(D + \\log(1/\\varepsilon),\n1/\\varepsilon) \\cdot \\log D)$ queries suffice to learn $f$ within error\n$\\varepsilon$, even in a setting when $f$ can be adversarially corrupted on a\n$c\\varepsilon$-fraction of points, for a sufficiently small constant $c$.

However, these\ncoarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and\nintentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific\nitem attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in\ninaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a\npersistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately\nundermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.\n  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation\nFeed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within\nmainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users\nto passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control\nover recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support\nthis paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser\nAgent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a\nPlanner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly\npolicy adjustment.

Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory", "summary": "This paper studies the capacity of massive random-access cellular networks,\nmodeled as a MIMO fading channel with an infinite number of interfering cells.\nTo characterize the symmetric sum rate of the network, a random-coding argument\nis invoked together with the assumption that in all cells users draw their\ncodebooks according to the same distribution. This can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the assumption of Gaussian codebooks, often encountered in\nthe literature. The network is further assumed to be noncoherent: the\ntransmitters and receivers are cognizant of the statistics of the fading\ncoefficients, but are ignorant of their realizations. Finally, it is assumed\nthat the users access the network at random. For the considered channel model,\nrigorous bounds on the capacity are derived. The behavior of these bounds\ndepends critically on the path loss from signals transmitted in interfering\ncells to the intended cell. In particular, if the fading coefficients of the\ninterferers (ordered according to their distance to the receiver) decay\nexponentially or more slowly, then the capacity is bounded in the transmit\npower. This confirms that the saturation regime in interference-limited\nnetworks -- observed by Lozano, Heath, and Andrews (\"Fundamental limits of\ncooperation\", IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Sept. 2013) -- cannot be avoided by\nrandom user activity or by using channel inputs beyond the scale family. In\ncontrast, if the fading coefficients decay faster than double-exponentially,\nthen the capacity is unbounded in the transmit power. Proving an unbounded\ncapacity is nontrivial even if the number of interfering cells is finite, since\nthe condition that the users' codebooks follow the same distribution prevents\ninterference-avoiding strategies such as time- or frequency-division multiple\naccess. We obtain this result by using bursty signaling together with treating\ninterference as noise."}

Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on\nthe used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that\nTransformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data\nquality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational\ncosts, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.\nThis study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of\nhyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the\nquality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It\nis performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model\nsetups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on\nthree dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to\nreal data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world\ndatasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of\nhyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT\nconsistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the\nlargest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools\nachieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger\ndatasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity.

Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,\nmost existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In\nthis study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial\nstates through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose\nthe concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's\ncompetitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly\nshaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error\nbound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To\nbridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a\nfine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training\ncontroller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a\nprincipled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals\nand thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a\ncomputationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information\ndecomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into\nfine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and\nsynergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically\nbalances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial\nstate to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.\nOur work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a\npowerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking\nsynergistic multi-modal fusion."}

In terms of changing\ntrends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown\nexcellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to\ncapture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures\nposes limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,\nresulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components\nbeing ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively\nincorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose\ncombining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider\nlong-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained\nlocal patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling\nlocal variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that\nprocesses the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the\ninter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel\nprocessing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the\nadoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce\ncomputational cost.

To\naddress this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL\nstrategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the\ndetrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension\nto existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the\ncurrent label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a\nbalanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.\nSubsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our\ndistribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two\ndatasets.

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in\nparticular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea\ngeneration, constituting a form of generalization from training data\nunaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to\nforms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an\nopen-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against\nfixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a\ntheoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their\ndegrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical\ncontributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of\ncreativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there\nexist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that\nthe ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific\nideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a\nmore fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity\nalgorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at\nscale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their\ncurrent form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide\na foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,\nmarking a new frontier in generalization abilities."}

What\nmakes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search\nuses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user\ninterests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to\nwhether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as\ncentral element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.\nIntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities.
