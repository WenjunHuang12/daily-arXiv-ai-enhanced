To better respond real-time user feedback, we have deployed an interactive recommender system (IRS) alongside our core homepage recommender system. This IRS is triggered by user click on homepage, and generates a series of highly relevant recommendations based on the clicked item to meet focused browsing demands. Different from traditional e-commerce RecSys, the full-screen UI and immersive swiping down functionality present two distinct challenges for regular ranking system. First, there exists explicit interference (overlap or conflicts) between ranking objectives, i.e., conversion, view and swipe down. This is because there are intrinsic behavioral co-occurrences under the premise of immersive browsing and swiping down functionality. Second, the ranking system is prone to temporal greedy traps in sequential recommendation slot transitions, which is caused by full-screen UI design. To alleviate these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-temporal collaborative ranking (STCRank) framework to achieve collaboration between multi-objectives within one slot (spatial) and between multiple sequential recommondation slots. In multi-objective collaboration (MOC) module, we push Pareto frontier by mitigating the objective overlaps and conflicts. In multi-slot collaboration (MSC) module, we achieve global optima on overall sequential slots by dual-stage look-ahead ranking mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed method brings about purchase and DAU co-growth. The proposed system has been already deployed at Kuaishou E-shop since 2025.6."}

This paper introduces a structured, iterative methodology leveraging LLMs to optimize knowledge acquisition, automate ontology artifact generation, and enable continuous refinement cycles. We demonstrate this approach through a detailed case study focused on developing a user context profile ontology within the vehicle sales domain. Key contributions include significantly accelerated ontology construction processes, improved ontological consistency, effective bias mitigation, and enhanced transparency in the ontology engineering process. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of integrating LLMs into ontology development, notably improving scalability, integration capabilities, and overall efficiency in knowledge management systems."}

We identify the lack of {\\itshape need-to-modify} itinerary data as the critical bottleneck hindering research on this task and propose a general pipeline to overcome it. This pipeline frames the generation of such data as an intent-driven perturbation task. It instructs large language models to perturb real world itineraries using three atomic editing operations: REPLACE, ADD, and DELETE. Each perturbation is grounded in three intents, including disruptions of popularity, spatial distance, and category diversity. Furthermore, a hybrid evaluation metric is designed to ensure perturbation effectiveness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on iTIMO, revealing the limitations of current LLMs and lead to several valuable directions for future research.

RAG systems are often dynamic and may involve multiple rounds of retrieval. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are available through academic IR platforms, these platforms are typically designed for the Cranfield paradigm in which all queries are known up front and can be batch processed offline. This simplification accelerates research but leaves state-of-the-art retrieval models unable to support downstream applications that require online services, such as arbitrary dynamic RAG pipelines that involve looping, feedback, or even self-organizing agents. In this work, we introduce RoutIR, a Python package that provides a simple and efficient HTTP API that wraps arbitrary retrieval methods, including first stage retrieval, reranking, query expansion, and result fusion. By providing a minimal JSON configuration file specifying the retrieval models to serve, RoutIR can be used to construct and query retrieval pipelines on-the-fly using any permutation of available models (e.g., fusing the results of several first-stage retrieval methods followed by reranking). The API automatically performs asynchronous query batching and caches results by default. While many state-of-the-art retrieval methods are already supported by the package, RoutIR is also easily expandable by implementing the Engine abstract class.

STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs."}

Current tokenomic models, which predominantly rely on static or threshold-based buyback heuristics, are ill-equipped to handle complex system dynamics and often function pro-cyclically, exacerbating instability during market downturns. To bridge this gap, we propose the Dynamic-Control Buyback Mechanism (DCBM), a formalized control-theoretic framework that utilizes a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with strict solvency constraints to regulate the token economy as a dynamical system. Extensive agent-based simulations utilizing Jump-Diffusion processes demonstrate that DCBM fundamentally outperforms static baselines, reducing token price volatility by approximately 66% and lowering operator churn from 19.5% to 8.1% in high-volatility regimes. These findings establish that converting tokenomics from static rules into continuous, structurally constrained control loops is a necessary condition for secure and sustainable decentralized intelligence networks."}

As algorithms are increasingly used in decision-making over datapoints with sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it is becoming crucial to enforce fairness to avoid bias and discrimination. Recent work has addressed the challenge of developing efficient approximation algorithms for fair matroid submodular maximization. However, the best algorithms known so far are only guaranteed to satisfy a relaxed version of the fairness constraints that loses a factor 2, i.e., the problem may ask for $\\ell$ elements with a given attribute, but the algorithm is only guaranteed to find $\\lfloor \\ell/2 \\rfloor$. In particular, there is no provable guarantee when $\\ell=1$, which corresponds to a key special case of perfect matching constraints.\n  In this work, we achieve a new trade-off via an algorithm that gets arbitrarily close to full fairness. Namely, for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, we give a constant-factor approximation to fair monotone matroid submodular maximization that in expectation loses only a factor $(1-\\varepsilon)$ in the lower-bound fairness constraint. Our empirical evaluation on a standard suite of real-world datasets -- including clustering, recommendation, and coverage tasks -- demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our methods."}

Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods."}

However, link-cut trees cannot support parallel batch-dynamic updates and have limitations on the kinds of queries they support.\n  In this paper, we design a new parallel batch-dynamic trees data structure called UFO trees that simultaneously supports a wide range of query functionality, supports work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic updates, and is competitive with link-cut trees when run sequentially.

We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets.

We propose a unified probabilistic framework to construct L-PIR-SI schemes where the privacy leakage is quantified by a parameter $\\varepsilon$, consistent with differential privacy standards. We characterize the achievable download costs and show that our results generalize several landmark results in the PIR literature: they recover the capacity of PIR-SI when $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, and reduce to the known bounds for leaky-PIR when side information is absent. This work provides the first look at the trade-offs between leakage, side information, and retrieval efficiency."}

Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large.

The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks.

We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time."}

Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization."}

In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity.

It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook."}

In particular, we study linear compression schemes and show that simple truncation is the best linear scheme in two cases: (1) testing opposite signs of the same magnitude of correlation, and (2) testing for or against independence. We conjecture, supported by numerical evidence, that truncation is the best linear code for testing any correlations of opposite signs. Further, for testing against independence, we also compute classical random coding exponents and show that truncation, and consequently any linear code, is strictly suboptimal."}

While existing literature extensively covers link-level designs, the transition toward large-scale deployment necessitates a fundamental understanding of network-level performance. This paper investigates a network ISAC model where a source node communicates with a destination via a relay network, while intermediate nodes concurrently perform cooperative sensing over specific spatial regions. We formulate a novel optimization framework that captures the interplay between multi-node routing and sensing coverage. For a one-dimensional path network, we provide an analytical characterization of the complete sensing-throughput region. Extending this to general network topologies, we establish that the sensing-throughput Pareto boundary is piecewise linear and provide physical interpretations for each segment. Our results reveal the fundamental trade-offs between sensing coverage and communication routing, offering key insights for the design of future 6G heterogeneous networks."}

In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity."}

In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $Δ$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $Δ$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse. We also characterize the performance of the scheme in the finite field using another converse based on counting arguments."}

Lalitha"], "title": "Basis-Spline Assisted Coded Computing: Strategies and Error Bounds", "comment": null, "summary": "Coded computing has become a key framework for reliable distributed computation over decentralized networks, effectively mitigating the impact of stragglers. Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our framework significantly outperforms Berrut-based methods for various non-polynomial functions."}

In their work, Chandan et al. characterized the expressions for the rate-privacy trade-offs for these classes of WPIR schemes, under the mutual information leakage and maximal leakage metrics. Explicit achievable trade-offs for the same were also presented, which were shown to be competitive or better than prior WPIR schemes. However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved."}

Success is predicated on at least one decoder recovering the source within a maximum distortion constraint. We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint."}

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication."}

Deep neural networks are able to capture rich dependencies in data, offering a powerful means of estimating these probabilities and hence an avenue towards more effective compression algorithms. However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data. These results confirm that, when paired an advanced prediction model, PMATIC is robust to prediction mismatch while achieving compression rates that out-perform standard modern compression tools."}

The scheme uses two decoder views linked by automorphisms of the polar transform and publicly draws the encoder at random from the corresponding automorphism group. This yields perfect receiver privacy at any finite blocklength, since the public encoder distribution is independent of the receiver's choice bit. Sender privacy is obtained asymptotically via channel polarization combined with privacy amplification. Because the construction deliberately injects randomness on selected bad bit-channels, we derive a relaxed reliability criterion and evaluate finite-blocklength performance. Finally, we characterize the polar-transform automorphisms as bit-level permutations of bit-channel indices, and exploit this structure to derive and optimize an achievable finite-blocklength OT rate."}
