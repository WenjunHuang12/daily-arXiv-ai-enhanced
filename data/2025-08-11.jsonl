Prior\nmethods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw\nmodality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the\nuser-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these\nsemantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient\nmodeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions\nintroduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising\nperformance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals\nfrom the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item\nsemantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based\npersonalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with\nmodulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive\nviews. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through\ncontrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in\nsemantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism\nthat first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based\nInfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns\nbehavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to\nensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark\ndatasets validate the effectiveness of our framework."}

To preserve special patterns, weighting of the\nregularization components of the loss function has been introduced based on\nStatistical Process Control methodology. The proposed decomposition can be\napplied as a smoothing algorithm against the mean and dispersion of the time\nseries.

To resolve this problem,pruning operation is a crucial part in\noptimizing decision trees, as it not only reduces the complexity of trees but\nalso decreases the probability of generating overfit models. The conventional\npruning techniques like Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP) and Reduced Error Pruning\n(REP) are mostly based on greedy approaches that focus on immediate gains in\nperformance while pruning nodes of the decision tree. However, this might\nresult in a lower generalization in the long run, compromising the robust\nability of the tree model when introduced to unseen data samples, particularly\nwhen trained with small and complex datasets. To address this challenge, we are\nproposing a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based pruning approach, a reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-based technique, that will dynamically prune the tree to generate\nan optimal decision tree with better generalization. Our proposed approach\nassumes the pruning process as an exploration-exploitation problem, where we\nare utilizing the MAB algorithms to find optimal branch nodes to prune based on\nfeedback from each pruning actions.

Clinical\ninformation that informs prognostication is collected serially over time.\nShortly after cardiac arrest, various time-invariant baseline features are\ncollected (e.g., demographics, cardiac arrest characteristics). After ICU\nadmission, additional features are gathered, including time-varying hemodynamic\ndata (e.g., blood pressure, doses of vasopressor medications). We view these as\ntwo phases in which we collect new features. In this study, we propose a novel\nstepwise dynamic competing risks model that improves the prediction of\nneurological outcomes by automatically determining when to take advantage of\ntime-invariant features (first phase) and time-varying features (second phase).\nNotably, our model finds patients for whom this second phase (time-varying\nhemodynamic) information is beneficial for prognostication and also when this\ninformation is beneficial (as we collect more hemodynamic data for a patient\nover time, how important these data are for prognostication varies). Our\napproach extends the standard Fine and Gray model to explicitly model the two\nphases and to incorporate neural networks to flexibly capture complex nonlinear\nfeature relationships. Evaluated on a retrospective cohort of 2,278 comatose\npost-arrest patients, our model demonstrates robust discriminative performance\nfor the competing outcomes of awakening, withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy,\nand death despite maximal support.

A common solution is to enrich item representations using\nmultimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features.\nHowever, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not\ntailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user\ntastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual\ntones can also drift over time.

In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property\nestablishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\\mu$:\nlower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but\nimpose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in\nthem. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve\neffective classification performance under label noise.
