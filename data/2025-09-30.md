### [1] [Efficient Identification of High Similarity Clusters in Polygon Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23942)
*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个通过减少需要验证的聚类数量来降低计算负载的框架，用于大规模空间相似性计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Shapely 2.0和Triton等工具提高了空间相似性计算效率，但在处理极大数据集时仍面临计算量过大的挑战。

Method: 集成动态相似性索引阈值、监督调度和召回约束优化，利用核密度估计动态确定相似性阈值，机器学习模型优先处理聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算成本，具有可扩展性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够在满足用户定义的精度和召回要求的同时优化计算效率。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

### [2] [T-TAMER: Provably Taming Trade-offs in ML Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22992)
*Yuanyuan Yang,Ruimin Zhang,Jamie Morgenstern,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-Tamer是一个多阶段决策框架，通过引入“召回”机制（能够重新访问早期模型）来优化级联模型的准确性与延迟权衡，证明了召回策略在多项式时间内可获得最优性能保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型规模和复杂度的增长，高效服务面临准确率、延迟、资源使用等多目标权衡问题。级联模型中的提前退出决策需要平衡延迟减少与准确率损失，现有启发式方法缺乏理论保证和通用性。

Method: 将多模型服务形式化为多阶段决策过程，提出召回机制（允许重新访问早期模型），证明召回策略在多项式时间内可获得最优权衡。

Result: 在合成数据集以及视觉和NLP基准测试的提前退出工作负载上验证，基于召回的策略始终产生高效的准确率-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 召回机制对于实现可证明的性能保证是必要且充分的，该工作为提前退出和级联模型的设计提供了连接启发式实践与理论保证的原则性基础。

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

### [3] [Localizing Adversarial Attacks To Produces More Imperceptible Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22710)
*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究系统评估了局部对抗攻击的效果，发现相比全局攻击，局部攻击具有更低的像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM，但计算成本更高且攻击成功率略有下降。迭代方法比单步方法对局部化约束更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在系统评估局部对抗攻击的有效性、不可感知性和计算效率。

Method: 通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上评估局部对抗攻击，比较其像素扰动、PSNR、SSIM和攻击成功率等指标。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击实现了显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和改进的SSIM，但计算工作量增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法（PGD和C&W）比单步方法（FGSM）对局部化约束更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了局部对抗攻击的全面分析，为推进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

### [4] [In-Context Learning can Perform Continual Learning Like Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22764)
*Liuwang Kang,Fan Wang,Shaoshan Liu,Hung-Chyun Chou,Chuan Lin,Ning Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的持续学习能力，提出了上下文持续学习(ICCL)框架，发现模型在分布式练习中表现出类似人类的记忆保留特性，并提出了衡量模型与人类记忆相似度的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs通过上下文学习能够快速适应新任务，但其在多任务顺序到达时是否能实现长期保留和跨任务知识积累尚未充分探索。受人类记忆研究启发，作者希望探索ICL在多任务设置中的保留特性。

Method: 提出上下文持续学习(ICCL)框架，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习能力。在马尔可夫链基准上进行实验，分析分布式练习对保留的影响，并提出人类保留相似度指标来量化CL方法与人类记忆动态的匹配程度。

Result: 实验表明特定大型语言模型的ICCL受益于分布式练习，类似人类记忆保留，存在间距"甜蜜点"。线性注意力模型如MAMBA和RWKV展现出特别类似人类的保留模式，尽管其保留性能不如基于Transformer的LLMs。

Conclusion: ICCL既具有认知合理性又具有实际有效性，提供了一个仅需推理的持续学习范式，能够缓解灾难性遗忘并解决传统CL方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

### [5] [Sample-efficient Multiclass Calibration under $\ell_{p}$ Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23000)
*Konstantina Bairaktari,Huy L. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多类预测器校准误差定义，在指数样本复杂度和多项式样本复杂度之间插值，实现了多项式样本下的校准算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类预测器的校准具有挑战性，因为可能的预测值数量呈指数级增长，现有方法要么需要指数样本要么只能处理特定情况。

Method: 提出插值校准误差定义，应用自适应数据分析技术，在保持对数样本开销的同时实现高适应性。

Result: 算法能在除一个端点外的整个插值范围内使用多项式样本校准任何预测器，在另一个端点实现了对误差参数的近乎最优依赖。

Conclusion: 该工作为多类校准提供了理论保证，通过新颖的自适应数据分析应用解决了样本复杂度的挑战。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

### [6] [Communication-Efficient and Interoperable Distributed Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22823)
*Mounssif Krouka,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种支持模型异构的通信高效分布式学习框架，通过融合层输出共享实现隐私保护和模块化组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构间的协作学习挑战，确保互操作性同时保护隐私。

Method: 采用通用融合层输出维度，将模型划分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，客户端仅共享融合层输出。

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分割学习基线，实现了更优的通信效率，并在异构架构下保持稳定的训练性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了通信效率、模型异构性和隐私保护需求。

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [7] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，分析了自注意力机制在给定预算下能可靠恢复多少种不同关系，推导出容量缩放定律，并为多头注意力提供了基于容量的新理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知自注意力能学习token间的关系，但缺乏对其容量的形式化理解：在给定预算下，单层能可靠恢复多少种不同关系？

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道表示为具有m'条有向边的图，分析总键维度DK与可恢复关系数之间的关系，推导信息论下界和显式构造上界。

Result: 证明DK = Θ(m' log m' / d_model)在广泛图类中既是必要的信息论下界，也是充分的显式构造上界；当嵌入被压缩时，将固定DK分配到多个小头能减轻干扰，增加可恢复关系数。

Conclusion: 结果为自注意力容量提供了具体的缩放定律，并为跨头分配键-查询预算提供了原则性设计规则。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

### [8] [Drift-Adapter: A Practical Approach to Near Zero-Downtime Embedding Model Upgrades in Vector Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23471)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter是一个轻量级可学习转换层，通过将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间，避免生产向量数据库升级时需要重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，显著降低运营中断和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库并重建近似最近邻索引，导致显著的运营中断和计算成本。

Method: 提出Drift-Adapter轻量级可学习转换层，系统评估三种适配器参数化方法：正交Procrustes、低秩仿射和紧凑残差MLP，在少量新旧嵌入对样本上训练。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率，仅增加不到10微秒的查询延迟，相比完全重新索引减少100倍以上的重新计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter作为敏捷模型部署的实用解决方案，能够实现接近零运营中断的升级，并分析了其对不同模型漂移、训练数据大小和可扩展性的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

*Roie Kazoom,Yuval Ratzabi,Etamar Rothstein,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对表格数据的黑盒决策型对抗攻击方法，结合无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索，在最小化查询次数的前提下有效攻击表格模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据的对抗鲁棒性研究相对视觉和语言领域较为缺乏，需要专门针对表格数据特性的攻击方法来揭示模型脆弱性。

Method: 采用黑盒决策攻击框架，结合无梯度方向估计和迭代边界搜索策略，能够有效处理离散和连续特征空间。

Result: 攻击方法在多种模型上均取得超过90%的成功率，包括传统机器学习分类器和基于大语言模型的流程，且每个实例仅需少量查询。

Conclusion: 表格模型对对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，现实世界决策系统迫切需要更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DPO-PoP方法，通过偏好间的偏好标注来推断自适应边界，在RLHF中改善泛化能力和对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定边界或基于评分的简单边界，无法处理偏好强度的变化，且依赖可能不可靠的偏好评分。

Method: 扩展DPO方法，利用偏好间的偏好监督来推断每个数据点的自适应边界。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上优于vanilla DPO、固定边界DPO和真实边界DPO，但发现判别性能和生成性能存在权衡。

Conclusion: 提出两种采样策略来平衡判别和生成性能，通过偏好间的偏好监督可以更有效地建模偏好强度。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

### [11] [GBSK: Skeleton Clustering via Granular-ball Computing and Multi-Sampling for Large-Scale Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23742)
*Yewang Chen,Junfeng Li,Shuyin Xia,Qinghong Lai,Xinbo Gao,Guoyin Wang,Dongdong Cheng,Yi Liu,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GBSK算法，利用粒度球技术处理大规模数据聚类，通过多采样构建多粒度粒度球来发现数据骨架结构，显著降低计算开销同时保持高聚类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大规模数据集聚类任务的计算效率问题，需要开发能够有效捕捉数据底层结构的高效算法。

Method: 使用粒度球技术，通过多采样数据集并构建多粒度粒度球，逐步揭示统计骨架结构，还提出了参数简化的自适应版本AGBSK。

Result: 在标准计算硬件上的大量实验表明，GBSK在大规模数据集上实现了高效率和强聚类性能，包括处理1亿个实例、256维的数据集。

Conclusion: GBSK算法能够有效处理大规模数据聚类问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

*Sameep Chattopadhyay,Nikhil Karamchandani,Sharayu Mohair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对在线学习排序算法的对抗攻击框架，能够通过O(log T)次操纵使目标项目出现在top-K推荐中，同时让学习算法产生线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在线学习排序算法在信息检索和推荐系统中广泛应用，但其对协同对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 提出了两种攻击策略：针对CascadeUCB1的CascadeOFA和针对PBM-UCB的PBMOFA，通过精心设计的操纵手段干扰学习过程。

Result: 理论证明两种策略仅需O(log T)次操纵即可成功，并在真实数据上的实验验证了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了在线学习排序算法在对抗攻击下的安全漏洞，为开发更鲁棒的排序系统提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

Conclusion: 研究为基于数据集特征和计算约束选择合适的校准方法提供了实用指南，弥合了不确定性量化中理论理解与实际实施之间的差距。

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文使用神经正切核理论分析图神经网络中的邻域采样方法，发现不同采样方法在有限样本下产生不同的后验高斯过程，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同结果，且没有一种采样方法在所有情况下都最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样是训练大规模图神经网络的重要技术，能控制内存和时间消耗，但其系统性行为缺乏理论理解。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具分析几种标准邻域采样方法及其对应的后验高斯过程。

Result: 有限样本下不同采样方法产生不同的后验分布，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同结果；后验协方差不可比较，与观察到的没有采样方法占主导地位的现象一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法在理论上具有不同的行为特性，没有单一方法在所有情况下最优，这解释了实践中观察到的现象。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

Method: 通过理论分析建立扩散模型与凯利准则的数学联系，研究条件扩散模型中互信息的存储机制，分析分类器无引导对互信息的影响，并与量子力学中的费米黄金法则建立关联。

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于X与Y之间的互信息，分类器无引导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这对图像生成特别重要，因为图像与标签的互信息通常较低。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则存在深刻联系，条件扩散模型通过存储互信息实现条件生成，分类器无引导是提升互信息的有效策略，同时澄清了扩散模型作为无限深度自编码器的理解。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的Conformal Prediction技术对数据集中的敏感属性不敏感，需要将公平性纳入CP框架，确保不同子组之间的条件覆盖保证。

Method: 将Conformal Fairness框架扩展到联邦学习设置，利用可交换性假设，分析不同人口群体的公平性差距来审计联邦模型的公平性。

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上进行了实证验证，充分验证了所提出框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 成功将CF框架扩展到联邦学习环境，为联邦模型的公平性审计提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下的奖励感知蒸馏提供了理论上有保证且实际高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MonoCon是一个通过功能约束学习高质量表示的框架，使用单调MLP头连接到预训练编码器，在保持性能的同时获得更紧凑和鲁棒的嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习高质量、鲁棒、高效且解耦的表示是AI的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种方法。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调MLP头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应，学习鲁棒、解耦且紧凑的嵌入。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上，表示比基线紧凑9倍、鲁棒1.5倍，保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI上，表示紧凑3.4倍、鲁棒1.4倍，STSb分数略有降低。

Conclusion: MonoCon通过功能约束学习到的鲁棒超紧凑表示为边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

Motivation: 解决量化感知训练中FP阶段和QAT阶段计算分配不明确的问题，寻找最优计算分配策略以提高量化模型精度。

Method: 通过大量实验分析不同计算预算、QAT位宽和模型大小下的性能影响，提出基于tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量的预测方法，并开发融合冷却和QAT的新方法。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，提出的缩放定律能准确预测最优QAT比例和最终性能，新方法可节省大量计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为高效QAT规划提供了实用指导，能够在相同计算预算下训练出更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从梯度白化角度分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，解释其预条件器作为白化矩阵的近似，并建立SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价性。

Method: 通过梯度白化理论框架分析三种算法，建立SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下的理论等价关系，并使用nanoGPT和灰度图像着色实验进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失方面与Adam和Shampoo相比没有显著优势，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP虽然在训练效率上表现良好，但与Shampoo在理论上等价，实际性能差异不显著，梯度白化视角为理解这些优化算法提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行列方差，解决低比特量化中的异常值表示问题，显著提升语言模型的困惑度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下精度时会出现困惑度下降，主要原因是异常值表示导致共享尺度的参数精度问题，这在无校准的均匀量化方法中尤为明显。

Method: SINQ通过添加第二轴尺度因子和快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法，找到尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一新的量化代理目标。该方法无需层间交互，可轻松应用于新架构的任何线性层。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上的评估显示，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4的困惑度表现，优于无校准均匀量化基线，并可进一步与校准和非均匀量化级别结合增强效果。

Conclusion: SINQ是一种有效的后训练量化增强方法，能够解决低比特量化中的精度问题，提升语言模型在低精度部署时的性能表现。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

Motivation: 变分数据同化方法在海洋和大气预报中广泛应用，但涉及Hessian信息时计算成本高昂，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）构建元学习框架，近似逆Hessian算子，为共轭梯度法提供初始化，形成FNO-CG方法。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的数值实验显示，FNO-CG方法相比标准CG平均相对误差减少62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态条件下改进最明显。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法在挑战性数据同化问题中展现出鲁棒性和高效性，特别适用于病态场景。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Conclusion: GDR-learners具有准oracle效率和速率双重稳健性，是渐近最优的，为潜在结果分布估计提供了理论保证的灵活框架。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: 提出的功能评论家建模为离策略actor-critic学习提供了一个新的框架，成功解决了移动目标问题和离策略策略梯度估计困难，是首个可证明收敛的离策略目标AC算法。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了将变分方法融入稀疏自编码器(SAE)是否能改善特征组织和可解释性，但发现变分SAE(vSAE)在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，主要因为KL散度项导致过度正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索变分方法是否能通过概率采样改善SAE中的特征组织，使特征在潜在空间中更连贯地排列并避免重叠。

Method: 提出变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用从学习的高斯后验中随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，并加入朝向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，虽然特征独立性和消融指标表现优异，但KL散度项导致过度正则化，显著减少了活跃特征比例。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于SAE并不能改善特征组织或可解释性，vSAE特征虽然鲁棒性更好，但死特征数量明显多于基线。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

Conclusion: SPS-GAN成功实现了从任意测量类型中发现配置空间结构，并能推广到未见物理参数，为多系统动力学建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS是一种轻量级微调方法，可将单个MoE检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制面，允许在推理时动态调整稀疏度k，无需更换模型或架构改动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏专家混合模型通常针对固定稀疏度训练，为满足不同效率目标需要训练和维护多个模型，这增加了服务复杂性、训练成本和维护负担。

Method: PHDS通过跨稀疏度级别的混合训练和在高稀疏度下的短期课程学习，无需架构修改即可实现稀疏度控制。

Result: 实验表明PHDS在多个基准模型上匹配或超过专用模型性能，跨稀疏度一致性提升达22%，实现了简化的运行时MoE部署。

Conclusion: 该方法使全局稀疏度成为一等服务原语，为MoE部署提供了灵活性和简化性。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Conclusion: 层理论为拓扑深度学习提供了自然且有原则的形式化方法，能够实现更表达力的消息传递，特别是对于高阶拓扑结构。

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

TL;DR: 该论文通过谱分析方法研究大语言模型预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化，发现了三个一致的几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、中期的维度扩展和随后的各向异性压缩，这些阶段与模型性能提升密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型复杂能力的涌现，因此需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型训练过程中的内在变化。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，测量有效秩(RankMe)和特征谱衰减(α-ReQ)，分析OLMo(1B-7B)和Pythia(160M-12B)模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现了三个一致的几何阶段：初始表示坍缩、中期维度扩展(对应n-gram记忆峰值)、后期各向异性压缩(对应下游任务性能显著提升)。后训练中SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，RLVR诱导压缩寻求动态。

Conclusion: 模型训练中的几何阶段变化源于交叉熵优化与表征瓶颈的相互作用，不同后训练方法对表示几何产生不同影响，从而影响模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾难性干扰（灾难性遗忘）是机器学习中的基本挑战，当模型适应新任务时会逐渐丧失对先前学习任务的性能。本文旨在从潜在表示学习的角度更好地理解和建模这个问题

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用最大似然估计从部分任务感知（PTA）和全任务感知（ATA）配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量

Result: 理论分析和实证验证表明，识别和学习这些共享表示可以有效缓解机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰

Conclusion: 通过识别共享潜在变量最小化PTA和ATA设置之间的距离，为缓解灾难性干扰提供了理论保证和实际性能提升

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Motivation: 6G网络需要边缘智能，联邦学习是实现协作训练的关键，但面临数据敏感性和异构性挑战：参数共享存在数据重建风险，统一模型难以适应不同本地分布。

Method: 使用样本级表示进行知识共享，应用个性化差分隐私策略抵御重建攻击；开发隐私感知的神经架构搜索算法，生成本地定制架构和超参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上，相比PerFedRLNAS方法准确率提升6.82%，模型大小减少到1/10，通信成本降低到1/20。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对表示型联邦学习的个性化差分隐私解决方案，具有理论收敛保证，在保证强隐私保护的同时显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

TL;DR: 提出了GuardNet，一种分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越容易受到越狱攻击，这些攻击会绕过对齐约束并引发未经授权或有害行为，威胁模型的安全性、可靠性和可信度。

Method: 构建结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力派生标记关系的结构化图，然后应用图神经网络进行提示级和标记级过滤。

Result: 在多个数据集和攻击设置下，GuardNet显著优于现有防御方法，提示级F1分数从66.4%提升到99.8%，标记级F1从48-75%提升到74-91%。

Conclusion: GuardNet尽管结构复杂但保持了可接受的延迟，在跨域评估中泛化良好，是实际应用中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

TL;DR: IsingFormer是一个基于Transformer的神经网络，通过生成全局自旋配置来加速马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法，在采样和组合优化任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的MCMC方法在临界点和复杂能量景观中混合缓慢，Parallel Tempering虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。需要能够生成全局配置的提案机制来加速采样和优化。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上学习生成完整的自旋配置，这些配置作为Metropolis步骤中的全局提案，与传统的单自旋翻转互补。在Parallel Tempering框架中注入这些神经提案。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中，IsingFormer能重现磁化和自由能曲线，并泛化到未见温度；在3D自旋玻璃优化中，找到显著更低的能量状态；在整数分解任务中，成功泛化到未见半素数。

Conclusion: IsingFormer证明通过神经提案捕获全局结构可以系统加速蒙特卡洛方法，实现更快的采样和更强的组合优化性能，并具有跨问题实例的泛化能力。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 在医疗等数据隐私重要的领域，联邦学习面临统计异质性挑战。受医疗场景启发，探索中央服务器能否不仅构建模型，还能指导新患者到最适合其病情的医院。

Method: 引入基于经验似然的框架，同时实现两个目标：(1) 在每个客户端上学习有效的本地模型，(2) 为新查询找到最佳匹配的客户端。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，相比标准联邦学习方法，该框架在模型准确性和客户端指导精度方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能和资源高效的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异质性视为特征而非问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在任务中常依赖预训练的语言先验而忽视视觉证据，现有分析方法无法揭示视觉信息如何影响模型内部机制。

Method: 通过嵌入链分析层间表示动态，识别视觉整合点(VIP)，并开发TVI估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响强度。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合中，VIP现象普遍存在，TVI能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该方法为诊断和理解LVLMs中的语言先验提供了原则性工具包。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、优化器无关，可轻松集成到ML实验跟踪平台上，训练出的模型具有更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

*Wanjin Feng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于频谱相干性的可预测性对齐诊断框架，包含SCP和LUR两个工具，揭示了时间序列预测中可预测性漂移现象和模型架构的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI时间序列预测评估方法的根本缺陷——标准评估指标混淆了模型性能与数据内在不可预测性，需要更公平、更深入理解的评估范式。

Method: 引入频谱相干性可预测性(SCP)评分和线性利用比率(LUR)诊断工具，SCP量化预测任务的固有难度，LUR测量模型利用线性可预测信息的效率。

Result: 验证了框架有效性，首次系统证明了"可预测性漂移"现象，揭示了复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更优，而线性模型在更可预测任务上高效的架构权衡。

Conclusion: 呼吁从简单的聚合评分转向更深入的可预测性感知评估，促进更公平的模型比较和对模型行为的更深理解。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CLAD-Net框架，通过结合自监督transformer和知识蒸馏CNN，解决可穿戴传感器数据在连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在PAMAP2数据集上取得91.36%的最终准确率，仅8.78%的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴传感器人类活动识别中的分布偏移和灾难性遗忘问题，特别是在连续学习场景下，当模型面对新用户数据时性能下降的问题。

Method: CLAD-Net框架整合自监督transformer作为长期记忆，通过跨传感器注意力捕获全局活动模式；同时使用监督CNN通过知识蒸馏进行活动分类，在用户级微调时保留先验知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上达到91.36%最终准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法；在半监督设置下（仅10-20%标注数据）仍保持强性能。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net有效解决了可穿戴传感器连续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，对标注数据稀缺具有鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对奇Sigmoid激活函数类的初始化方法，通过选择适当的噪声尺度来避免激活值坍塌或饱和，使网络无需归一化层也能可靠训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数与权重初始化相互依赖，不恰当的初始化会导致饱和、方差坍塌和学习率敏感性问题，需要为特定激活函数定制初始化方法。

Method: 定义了奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出初始化方法，通过闭式选择噪声尺度使前向激活在目标层前保持良好分散。

Result: 该方法无需归一化层即可可靠训练，表现出强大的数据效率，并能支持标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、Orthogonal）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化的相互依赖问题，为特定激活函数类提供了有效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Flow Critic (DFC)，一种新型评论家架构，通过学习完整的状态-动作回报分布来增强流基策略的表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流基策略在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其潜力常受限于传统评论家只能学习单一标量期望回报估计。

Method: 使用流匹配技术对回报分布进行建模，将其表示为从简单基础分布到复杂目标回报分布的连续灵活变换。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中表现出色，特别是在需要多模态动作分布的任务上，在离线和离线到在线微调中都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFC通过提供丰富的分布式贝尔曼目标，为表达性流基策略提供了更稳定和信息丰富的学习信号。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而本研究专注于分析网络基础模型隐藏表示中编码的潜在知识，从表示空间利用、领域特征对齐和协议扰动鲁棒性角度进行系统评估。

Method: 采用三部分评估框架：嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用率，度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的对应关系，因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用5个多样化网络数据集评估4个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 发现所有模型都表现出显著各向异性、不一致特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖性等特性。识别出所有模型存在的众多局限性，证明解决这些问题可显著提升模型性能(最高提升0.35 F1分数，无需架构更改)。

Conclusion: 网络基础模型在潜在知识编码方面存在系统性局限性，通过针对性解决这些局限性可以显著改进模型性能，为未来网络基础模型的改进提供了重要方向。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种计算扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性的方法，可以在不重新训练的情况下预测模型输出的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练扩散模型相当于构建从数据分布到最优评分函数的映射。如果能对此映射进行微分，就可以在投入昂贵的重新训练之前预测模型对训练数据微小扰动的敏感性。

Method: 提出了一种闭式程序来计算该映射的方向导数，仅需要黑盒访问预训练评分模型及其对输入的导数。该方法扩展到估计扩散模型样本对目标度量加性扰动的敏感性。

Result: 该方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，计算时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径的对数似然相当。得到的敏感性与图像扩散模型在重新训练和微调后样本的变化相关。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效预测扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性，为模型优化和调整提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

TL;DR: CE-PO是一个增强策略优化的框架，通过引入因果连贯性奖励来减少语言模型的奖励攻击和不忠实推理，提高模型在因果扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，将正确输出与虚假或不忠实的推理配对，并在小的因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: CE-PO使用基于雅可比矩阵的敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实硬化抑制干扰信号，并通过Minkowski组合器将因果连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验结果显示，CE-PO相比基线平均提高准确率5.49%（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO框架有效减少了奖励攻击和不忠实推理链，在保持近似准确性的同时显著提高了模型的因果鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Motivation: 区块链和加密货币的匿名性为非法活动创造了机会，传统反洗钱监管面临挑战，需要能够同时捕捉结构和时间依赖关系且对噪声、不平衡和对抗行为具有鲁棒性的检测模型。

Method: 使用软投票集成方法整合图卷积网络(GCN)、图注意力网络(GAT)和图同构网络(GIN)，在真实世界Elliptic数据集上进行训练和优化。

Result: 优化的软投票集成在保持误报率低于1%的同时实现了对非法交易的高召回率，超越了单个GNN模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 集成图神经网络为实时加密货币监控提供了实用且前瞻性的解决方案，既具有即时反洗钱效用，又为量子增强的金融安全分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文介绍了8位Muon优化器，通过分块量化技术显著减少内存占用，在保持性能的同时比AdamW和8位AdamW表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中比AdamW有更快的收敛速度和计算效率，但像AdamW一样需要存储模型权重和累积梯度，存在内存开销问题。现有的8位AdamW变体虽然通过分块量化缓解了这个问题，但通常只在动态量化下稳定。

Method: 提出了使用分块量化的8位Muon优化器，支持线性和动态两种量化方案。

Result: 8位Muon在两种量化方案下都保持稳定，相比全精度Muon减少约74%的内存占用。在1.6B模型预训练和Llama 3.2 3B模型微调实验中，8位Muon性能接近Muon，且优于AdamW和8位AdamW。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在显著减少内存占用的同时保持了性能，并提供了理论视角来解释其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，现有方法难以有效处理这些特性。

Method: 采用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，使用分层注意力捕获日和周依赖关系，结合预计算提示嵌入来丰富标记表示，并冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上评估，RHYTHM相比最先进方法在整体准确率上提升2.4%，周末准确率提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM框架有效解决了人类移动预测中的复杂依赖问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Impute-MACFM，一种基于掩码感知条件流匹配的表格数据填补框架，专门处理随机缺失、随机缺失和非随机缺失机制，在多种基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据在医疗等应用中很常见，但缺失值问题普遍存在，会降低模型保真度和可靠性。现有填补方法要么假设限制严格，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而最近的生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用掩码感知条件流匹配框架，仅对缺失条目构建轨迹，同时约束观测条目的预测速度接近零。结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入，使用约束保持的常微分方程积分进行推理。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的性能，比竞争方法提供更稳健、高效和高质量的填补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配是处理表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）的有前景方向，Impute-MACFM为此建立了有效框架。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）在开发推理模型时存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了自感知推理模型的实现。

Method: 提出组序列策略梯度（GSPG）框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，并应用交叉熵正则化器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。对于非二元奖励，应用非线性奖励归一化和自适应正则化器裁剪。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中对大型语言模型进行后训练，显示该方法在推理准确性和置信度校准方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG方法能有效提升推理性能并抑制过度自信，置信度校准正则化器和GSPG在二元奖励情况下具有协同作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗式IRL方法训练不稳定，而近期非对抗式方法虽然提高了稳定性但缺乏理论保证，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出了TRRO理论框架，通过Minorization-Maximization过程保证单调改进，并实例化为PIRO算法，联合学习奖励函数和策略。

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，在奖励恢复、策略模仿和样本效率方面达到或超过最先进基线。

Conclusion: TRRO为IRL提供了类似TRPO在正向RL中的稳定性保证，PIRO是一个实用且稳定的IRL算法。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

*Sipeng Chen,Yan Zhang,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiINR是一个统一的框架，将隐式神经表示(INR)配置作为优化问题，使用贝叶斯优化自动寻找最优激活函数和初始化参数组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR配置依赖启发式方法、暴力网格搜索或任务特定调优，导致跨模态结果不一致，缺乏系统化的配置策略。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化在离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）和连续初始化参数的联合空间中进行高效搜索。

Result: OptiINR能够找到全局最优配置，在不同信号处理应用中一致地最大化性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR为INR设计建立了原则性基础，用数据驱动的优化过程取代了分散的手动调优。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

### [58] [TimeExpert: Boosting Long Time Series Forecasting with Temporal Mix of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23145)
*Xiaowen Ma,Shuning Ge,Fan Yang,Xiangyu Li,Yun Chen,Mengting Ma,Wei Zhang,Zhipeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，将键值对重新构想为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家以捕获长期依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键挑战：固有的滞后效应（历史时间戳对查询的动态相关性变化）和异常段（引入噪声信号降低预测精度）。

Method: 提出TMOE注意力机制，将键值对视为局部专家，每个专家专门处理不同的时间上下文，通过局部过滤进行自适应专家选择，同时保留共享全局专家。在PatchTST和Timer框架中替换原始注意力机制。

Result: 在七个真实世界长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，在保持Transformer长期依赖捕获能力的同时，实现了更精确的预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Mirror-Critique框架，通过对比模型生成解与真实解来训练具有信息性批判能力的验证器，显著提升了LLM推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励模型选择的测试时扩展方法常无法识别少数但正确的答案，限制了其效果超过简单多数投票，这源于验证器训练中缺乏信息性批判信号

Method: 利用小型指令调优模型通过拒绝采样合成高质量批判数据，教导验证器不仅知道什么错误，还知道为什么错误；使用合成数据冷启动LLMs的RLVR过程；部署Mirror-Verifier对候选解生成多个批判并聚合成验证分数

Result: Mirror-Verifier在解准确率方面显著优于多数投票，同时提高了求解器识别自身能力边界并拒绝回答的诚实性

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号有效提升了LLM的推理性能和诚实性

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalGym是一个用于晶体材料发现的开源强化学习环境，通过直接使用DFT计算作为反馈信号，为材料设计提供基准测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前材料设计主要依赖高精度DFT计算，机器学习方法大多不使用直接DFT信号作为反馈。为了在材料设计循环中引入直接DFT信号，需要开发适合的强化学习环境。

Method: 提出CrystalGym强化学习环境，对常见的基于值和策略的强化学习算法进行基准测试，优化带隙、体积模量和密度等DFT计算属性。

Result: 基准测试显示不同算法在不同环境设置下具有不同的样本效率和收敛特性，但没有算法能解决所有CrystalGym任务。

Conclusion: CrystalGym为强化学习研究者和材料科学家提供了解决实际设计问题的测试平台，为处理耗时奖励信号的强化学习方法开辟了新挑战领域。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用LSTM模型从智能手机被动感知数据中检测认知障碍，通过日常行为特征序列分析，采用两种技术提高模型泛化能力：日常感知增强和人口统计学个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床评估频率低且敏感性不足，难以捕捉老年人细微认知衰退。被动智能手机感知提供自然连续监测的潜力。

Method: 基于LSTM模型分析多模态感知数据的行为特征序列，采用日常感知增强生成合成序列，以及人口统计学个性化重新加权训练样本。

Result: 在36名老年人6个月数据上评估，两种技术联合将AUPRC从0.637提升至0.766。

Conclusion: 被动感知技术具有扩展老年人认知障碍监测的潜力。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

*Ziheng Peng,Shijie Ren,Xinyue Gu,Linxiao Yang,Xiting Wang,Liang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供层次化原型组织以支持专家引导和多级可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型通常只提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质且交互的输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式，这在高风险场景中限制了深度学习模型的信任度。

Method: ProtoTS基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，保留丰富的异质信息；通过层次化原型组织，粗粒度原型捕获全局时间模式，细粒度原型捕获局部变化，支持专家引导。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试（包括新发布的LOF数据集）中，ProtoTS不仅预测精度超过现有方法，还提供了专家可引导的解释，提升模型理解和决策支持。

Conclusion: ProtoTS成功实现了高精度时间序列预测与透明决策的结合，通过原型建模和层次化组织为高风险场景提供了可信赖的解释能力。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

*Chandan Tankala,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将密集关联记忆从向量扩展到概率分布，提出基于2-Wasserstein距离的分布关联记忆框架，主要关注高斯分布的Bures-Wasserstein类，实现分布存储和检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆模型仅限于向量表示，无法处理概率分布。本文旨在将关联记忆从向量提升到完整分布，连接经典关联记忆与现代生成建模。

Method: 定义存储分布上的log-sum-exp能量函数，以及基于最优传输映射的Gibbs加权聚合检索动态。平稳点对应于自一致的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，在Wasserstein扰动下提供定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从向量到分布的关联记忆升级，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了新框架。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

*Hangwei Zhang,Chun Kang,Yan Wang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究科学机器学习中的参数高效微调(PEFT)，发现LoRA在大型算子模型上表现较差，而适配器在傅里叶域具有指数衰减误差。基于此提出了频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，在3D Navier-Stokes基准上取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习领域尚未探索，该领域目标是建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 引入频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，根据频谱复杂性分配适配器容量，为低频分量分配高维模块，为高频分量分配低维模块。

Result: F-Adapter在多个具有挑战性的3D Navier-Stokes基准上建立了最先进的结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中PEFT的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域有效范式。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam是一种用于测试时熵最小化的非对称孪生架构，通过非对称散度对齐防止模型崩溃，在视觉适应和大型语言模型推理任务中表现稳定且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯熵最小化可能导致模型选择非泛化的捷径（如膨胀logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别），从而产生崩溃解，需要防止这种退化行为。

Method: 提出ZeroSiam非对称孪生架构，使用可学习的预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作器实现非对称散度对齐，有效防止崩溃。

Result: 实验表明ZeroSiam不仅能防止崩溃解，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在各种测试场景和不同模型（包括易崩溃的小模型）中表现稳定。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam是一种简单高效的测试时熵最小化方法，在防止模型崩溃的同时提升性能，适用于视觉适应和语言模型推理任务。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

TL;DR: CoSIFL是一个联邦学习框架，集成了主动警报机制、本地差分隐私和基于Stackelberg博弈的激励机制，以应对恶意客户端攻击并激励高质量数据贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临恶意客户端攻击和激励参与者贡献高质量数据的挑战，需要在严格隐私要求下确保系统安全性和参与积极性。

Method: 使用主动警报机制和鲁棒聚合防御拜占庭和推理攻击，采用Tullock竞赛启发式激励机制，将服务器与客户端交互建模为两阶段Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 实验证明CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案，系统存在唯一均衡点。

Conclusion: CoSIFL通过集成安全、隐私和激励机制，有效解决了联邦学习中的安全威胁和参与激励问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了MXFP4和NVFP4两种4位浮点格式在LLM推理中的实际表现，发现现有方法在FP4量化中存在两个关键问题，并提出了MR-GPTQ方法来解决这些问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式如MXFP4和NVFP4承诺革新LLM推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证，需要系统评估和专门优化方法。

Method: 提出了Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ)方法，通过块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来适配FP4的独特属性，并开发了高性能GPU内核实现。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现了3.6x层级和2.2x端到端加速，在RTX5090上实现6x层级和4x端到端加速，显著提升了MXFP4的精度，接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但格式专门化方法如MR-GPTQ能够解锁精度与性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了上下文价值感知的上下文强化学习(CV-ICRL)，通过引入上下文价值来解决上下文模糊性问题，有效改善了ICRL在测试时的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICRL方法在测试时无法像训练数据那样持续改进性能，存在上下文模糊性问题，即模型自身的随机动作可能生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史，导致性能下降的恶性循环。

Method: 提出CV-ICRL方法，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时策略理论上可达到的理想性能。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提高了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: 上下文价值能够收紧相对于理想单调改进策略的性能差距下界，CV-ICRL成功解决了上下文模糊性问题，提升了ICRL的适应能力。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

automotive dataset with 29,100 events and 474 labels, OSCAR recovers
interpretable causal structures in minutes, while classical methods fail to
scale, enabling practical scientific diagnostics at production scale.

Conclusion: 紧凑模型通过领域特定强化学习可以在专门技术数学上达到大型模型性能，且训练过程对通用数学能力有积极迁移作用，验证了可验证正确性属性在强化学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

### [71] [SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Speculative Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23232)
*Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Zijun Min,Liang Yao,Haibo Zhang,Yang Liu,Anxiang Zeng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个新颖的框架，将推测性解码与RL rollout过程集成，通过重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，避免冗余生成，将rollout时间减少2-3倍而不影响策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地依赖带有可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）来引发可靠的思维链推理。然而，训练过程仍然受到计算昂贵的rollout阶段的瓶颈限制。现有加速方法（如并行化、目标和数据驱动的修改以及重放缓冲区）要么收益递减，要么引入偏差，要么忽略了迭代间的冗余。

Method: SPEC-RL整合了推测性解码与RL rollout过程，重用先前的轨迹段作为推测前缀，并通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在多种数学推理和泛化基准测试（包括GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等）上的实验表明，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少了2-3倍，而不会影响策略质量。

Conclusion: 作为一个纯粹的rollout阶段增强，SPEC-RL与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为扩展大型推理模型的RLVR提供了一条通用且实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

*Shayan Alahyari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LatentDiff框架，使用条件扩散模型和基于优先级的生成方法，在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征，以解决深度不平衡回归问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界回归任务中数据分布严重倾斜，模型主要从丰富的多数样本中学习，但无法准确预测少数标签。虽然不平衡分类已被广泛研究，但不平衡回归相对较少探索。深度不平衡回归缺乏适合高维数据的专用数据级解决方案。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型与基于优先级的生成方法，在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征。该方法计算效率高，适用于图像、文本等多种高维数据模态。

Result: 在三个深度不平衡回归基准测试中，在少数区域表现出显著改进，同时保持整体准确性。

Conclusion: LatentDiff填补了深度不平衡回归领域数据级解决方案的空白，为处理高维不平衡回归问题提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ATDP方法，通过针对敏感token梯度施加更大噪声，显著减少DP训练时间，同时保护敏感信息并保持模型在非敏感数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPSGD方法对所有梯度注入均匀噪声，导致训练时间显著延长且模型准确性下降。LLMs经常记忆敏感信息，存在隐私风险。

Method: ATDP是DP-SGD的改进版本，自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重。在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，仅需少量轻量级后处理。

Result: ATDP将DP微调的计算开销减少约90%，训练时间大幅缩短，同时达到与最先进DP-SGD方法相当的隐私保护水平，准确性损失最小。

Conclusion: ATDP可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，或直接应用于非私有模型作为快速隐私增强措施，提供高效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的高维参数空间子空间回归方法，用于降阶建模。通过预测比所需维度更大的子空间来简化学习问题，提高映射平滑度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化降阶建模中，高维参数空间使得经典插值策略不可行或不可靠，需要更有效的子空间近似方法。

Method: 将插值问题松弛为回归问题，引入适合子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络近似高维目标函数，并通过预测更大维度的子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，使Grassmann流形上的映射更平滑。实证结果显示预测更大子空间能显著提高准确性。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数偏微分方程求解等任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大规模数据集微调方法计算成本高且效率低，需要开发更智能的数据合成方法来精确提升模型在特定推理能力上的表现。

Method: 采用对抗性框架，模型交替扮演攻击者和防御者角色，由工具增强的评判者监督，合成带解释性注释的多步骤问题，针对特定推理能力进行训练数据生成。

Conclusion: 研究发现数据集特征与模型性能存在非单调关系，揭示了领域特定的最优复杂度点，表明未来模型改进可能依赖于智能合成的小型、精确针对性训练数据集。

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测抗体-抗原界面对于疫苗设计、免疫诊断和治疗性抗体开发至关重要，但仅从序列进行可靠预测仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于Conformer骨干网络，引入物理启发的滑动注意力机制，无需三维结构数据即可恢复残基级接触。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体-抗原数据集上达到最先进性能，超越广泛使用的基于序列的抗体无关表位预测方法。消融研究显示滑动注意力显著提升表位预测精度。

Conclusion: ABCONFORMER能够仅从序列准确预测抗体-抗原相互作用，为疫苗和抗体开发提供有力工具，代码将在接受后开源。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在推理时的控制通常依赖启发式指导或需要偏差校正的SMC方法，需要更灵活高效的替代方案。

Method: 基于副本交换算法设计CREPE方法，通过副本交换机制实现扩散模型的推理时控制。

Result: 在温度退火、奖励倾斜、模型组合和分类器自由指导去偏等任务中表现优异，与现有SMC方法性能相当。

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型的推理时控制提供了灵活有效的解决方案，具有序列生成、样本多样性和在线优化等优势。

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Result: 迁移学习、随机生存森林和集成方法在MA.27中改善了校准性能（ICI从0.042降至≤0.007），区分度保持相当（AUC从0.738提升至0.744-0.799）。在SEER外部验证中确认了这些方法的优势。

Conclusion: 当PREDICT v3相关信息缺失或可能存在数据集偏移时，迁移学习、从头随机生存森林和集成方法能够改善乳腺癌的预后准确性。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Motivation: 传统资产-负债管理方法难以有效平衡探索与利用，且需要大量调参。本文旨在开发一种无需环境建模、能直接学习最优策略的模型无关方法。

Method: 采用模型无关的策略梯度软演员-评论家算法，为ALM定制了演员的自适应探索和评论家的调度探索机制，确保探索与利用的有效平衡。

Result: 在200个随机市场场景中评估，该方法在所有替代策略中获得了更高的平均奖励，具有快速初始收益和持续优异表现。

Conclusion: 该方法优于传统金融策略和现有RL算法，其优势不在于复杂神经网络或改进参数估计，而在于无需学习环境即可直接学习最优ALM策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Motivation: 不规则多元时间序列在医疗和金融等领域普遍存在，其异步采样和不规则间隔给现有方法带来两个核心挑战：如何准确表示原始信息而不引入数据失真，以及如何有效捕获观测点之间的复杂动态依赖关系。

Method: ASTGI框架包含四个模块：时空点表示模块将离散观测编码为可学习嵌入空间中的点；邻域自适应图构建模块通过最近邻搜索为每个点构建因果图；时空动态传播模块基于点间相对位置生成消息并计算交互权重来迭代更新信息；查询点预测模块通过聚合邻域信息进行回归预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ASTGI优于各种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ASTGI框架有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的核心挑战，在准确表示原始信息和捕获复杂动态依赖方面表现出色。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 循环深度transformer的迭代过程具有两尺度特性，基于二阶步长差异的早退机制是更优的退出策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可识别的时间因果表示学习框架，专门为LLMs的高维概念空间设计，能够捕捉时间延迟和瞬时因果关系，为LLM的机制可解释性提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器等机制可解释性工具缺乏时间依赖建模、瞬时关系表示和理论保证，而因果表示学习方法又无法扩展到LLMs丰富的概念空间。

Method: 设计可识别的时间因果表示学习框架，结合稀疏自编码器技术，捕捉时间延迟和瞬时因果关系。

Result: 在匹配现实世界复杂度的合成数据集上验证了有效性，成功发现了LLM激活中有意义的概念关系。

Conclusion: 同时建模时间和瞬时概念关系能够提升LLMs的可解释性。

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调会导致次优迁移问题，提出Epsilon-Scheduling方法和expected robustness指标来改善鲁棒性微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管开源仓库中有大量非鲁棒预训练模型，但它们在鲁棒微调(RFT)方面的潜力尚未被充分理解。现有方法在同时实现下游任务适应性和对抗样本鲁棒性方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 系统研究从非鲁棒模型进行RFT，发现鲁棒目标会阻碍任务适应，提出Epsilon-Scheduling（在训练过程中调度扰动强度的启发式方法）和expected robustness评估指标。

Result: 实验表明Epsilon-Scheduling能有效防止次优迁移，在六种预训练模型和五个数据集上均能持续提升预期鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling方法成功解决了从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调时的次优迁移问题，为鲁棒性微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Conclusion: 这是离散空间SB方法评估的第一步，为未来更可重复的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Motivation: 在高维数据集中在低维流形的假设下，解决当流形仅通过数据分布隐式给出且缺乏经典算法所需的标准流形操作时的优化问题。

Method: 引入链接函数连接数据分布与几何操作，建立与扩散模型中得分函数的联系，提出DLF和DRGD两种推理算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代生成式AI中的数据驱动设计问题提供了实用解决方案，可应用于生成和设计应用。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

Motivation: 虽然先前研究表明连续思维链通过隐式并行思维提升大语言模型的推理能力，但叠加机制如何从基于梯度的训练方法中自然学习仍不清楚。

Method: 理论分析简化双层transformer在定向图可达性问题上的训练动态，追踪索引匹配logit的变化，并通过实验验证理论。

Result: 分析显示训练过程中索引匹配logit先增加后保持有界，有效平衡推理过程中的探索与利用，导致叠加机制的出现。

Conclusion: 连续思维链训练自然产生叠加机制，模型在不确定时会给多个合理搜索路径分配可比权重，实现并行推理探索。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，包括KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO四种选择器，在表格数据集上与传统方法相比表现出竞争力，特别是在结构化和合成数据集上有时更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。KANs通过样条参数化特征变换，可以直接获得可解释的重要性度量。

Method: 提出四种KAN-based特征选择器：KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO，并在多个分类和回归表格数据集基准上与经典基线方法(LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE)进行比较。

Result: KAN-based选择器在结构化和合成数据集上与经典基线竞争且有时更优。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归数据集和异构数据集上表现稳健。在分类任务中，KAN选择器有时通过消除冗余而超越其他选择器，特别是在高维多类数据中。

Conclusion: KAN-based特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习的特征表示常包含噪声的类间相似性，与模型预测语义相矛盾。GCR旨在解决这一问题，通过图一致性层使特征级关系反映类一致的预测行为。

Method: 引入参数无关的图一致性层(GCLs)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐。采用多层跨空间图对齐机制和自适应权重，学习层重要性。

Result: GCR在各种网络和数据集上改善了语义结构，促进更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的框架，无需修改架构或训练过程即可提升特征质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

TL;DR: 本文提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，通过改进离散扩散模型的训练目标来解决规划器在推理时引入的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过灵活的并行生成路径实现快速推理，但规划器修改了反向路径，导致训练时的均匀随机去噪路径与推理时的规划路径不匹配。

Method: 推导了新的Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO)，将基于规划器的反向动态直接纳入训练目标，并提出PAPL方法来调整标准掩码离散扩散损失。

Result: PAPL在多个领域带来一致改进：蛋白质序列建模相对增益40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对增益23%。

Conclusion: PAPL通过将规划器感知的路径学习纳入训练目标，有效解决了扩散语言模型中训练-推理不匹配问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么合并图层要么独立处理图层，这会丢失关键的层间依赖关系且难以扩展。需要一种能够有效融合多层证据并保持可扩展性的方法。

Result: 在六个公共多路数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）实现了持续的macro-F1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，有效解决了多路图链接预测中层间依赖和可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持精度但无法GPU加速，而2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%稀疏率会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡精度与加速的灵活稀疏方案。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持跨层非均匀稀疏分布。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的精度差距，在LLaMA-2 7B上实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，相比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM精度提升0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功平衡了模型精度与推理加速，为大规模语言模型部署提供了有效的稀疏解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

Conclusion: URS是首个能够用单一模型处理超过100种VRP变体的神经求解器，显著提升了零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具备线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射重新表述为查询和键之间的低秩传输计划来解决传统注意力机制的计算复杂度和注意力分布不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制存在两个主要问题：1）标准softmax注意力的二次计算复杂度限制了长上下文窗口的扩展；2）大多数注意力机制产生的行归一化映射可能导致过度关注少数token，降低鲁棒性和信息流动。现有双重随机注意力机制虽然能平衡token参与度，但通常引入显著开销，影响可扩展性。

Method: 利用注意力映射与查询和键之间传输计划的联系，通过将传输计划约束为低秩来实现。具体方法：1）学习一个具有小支撑的可学习枢轴度量；2）解决两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键）；3）将它们组合成条件耦合，产生秩最多为r≪n的注意力矩阵，在O(nr)时间内应用而不形成完整的n×n映射。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，LOTFormer实现了最先进的结果，在准确性和效率方面都超越了先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的注意力机制，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，有效解决了传统注意力机制的计算瓶颈和注意力分布不平衡问题，为长序列建模提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了哪些近似最关键，指导未来在计算可行性和归因准确性之间取得平衡的研究方向。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

*Wenhao Yang,Lin Li,Xiaohui Tao,Kaize Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的数据移除方法，通过因子去相关和损失扰动来增强深度预测模型，在保护用户隐私的同时提升模型在分布外场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规遵从要求从模型训练中移除敏感数据，但这一过程通常会导致分布偏移，从而损害模型性能，特别是在分布外场景下。

Method: 引入判别保持因子去相关模块（使用动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新）和平滑数据移除机制（通过损失扰动创建信息论保障）。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于其他基线方法，即使在显著分布偏移下也能保持高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景中均表现出卓越的效率和适应性，为隐私保护下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHASE是一个用于科学模拟的物理集成深度学习框架，通过结合异构数据编码和多级物理约束，将地球系统模型中生物地球化学自旋过程从1200年加速到20年，实现60倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数值模拟计算成本高昂，现有AI代理在关键任务应用中存在物理合理性、可信度和异构数据融合等问题，需要开发更可靠的加速方案。

Method: PHASE框架包含异构数据感知编码器和多级物理约束，从局部动力学到全局系统行为确保物理一致性，并在E3SM陆地模型中验证。

Result: 仅使用前20年模拟数据，PHASE就能推断出原本需要1200年积分才能达到的近平衡状态，实现至少60倍的积分长度减少，且能良好泛化到更高空间分辨率。

Conclusion: PHASE能够捕捉控制物理规律而非表面相关性，为陆地表面建模和其他复杂科学工作流程提供了实用且物理一致的加速方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Result: 在各种预训练和后训练任务中实现无损训练加速，节省高达近45%的挂钟时间

Conclusion: 该方法为现代大规模机器学习的数据效率研究提供了新的思路和方向

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

TL;DR: GEMS是一个无代理的生成式进化元求解器框架，用紧凑的潜在锚点和单个摊销生成器替代显式策略种群，通过蒙特卡洛模拟和元动态自适应扩展策略集，在多种游戏中比PSRO快6倍、内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中的可扩展性问题，现有基于种群的方法（如PSRO）需要存储显式策略种群和构建完整收益矩阵，导致二次计算和线性内存成本。

Method: 使用紧凑的潜在锚点和单个摊销生成器替代显式种群；通过无偏蒙特卡洛模拟、乘法权重元动态和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集；在生成器内使用基于优势的信任域目标训练最佳响应，无需存储和训练单独的参与者。

Result: 在欺骗消息游戏、库恩扑克和多粒子环境等双人和多人游戏中，GEMS比PSRO快约6倍，内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS保留了PSRO的博弈论保证，同时克服了其基本低效性，使多智能体学习在多个领域具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为POC的框架，用于决定何时重新求解MILP优化问题，在性能和成本之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时操作中需要频繁求解计算密集的MILP问题，但何时重新求解是一个重要经济决策。现有方法主要关注启发式、低数据设置和平滑目标，对常见的NP-hard MILP问题关注不足。

Method: 提出了POC框架，结合近端策略优化和变点检测，系统性地平衡性能和成本来决定重新求解时机。理论上建立了重新求解次数与成本之间的关系。

Result: 在8个合成和真实世界数据集上测试，POC始终优于现有基线方法2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架有效解决了MILP重新求解决策问题，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试和评估标准的文献空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调方法虽然减少了可训练参数，但内存开销仍然是实际部署的关键瓶颈，特别是模型激活在大批次和长上下文场景下占用大量内存

Method: 基于激活矩阵低秩特性的观察，提出LoRAct方法，使用在线压缩策略无需校准数据，并设计了针对低秩矩阵的采样正交分解算法

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明，LoRAct比广泛采用的LoRA方法进一步减少约80%的激活内存，同时保持竞争力性能

Conclusion: LoRAct提供了一种灵活高效的内存优化方法，解决了参数高效微调中的内存瓶颈问题

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的逼近率和Rademacher复杂度，比较不变与非不变网络的泛化误差。

Result: 群不变结构引入因子δ≤1，当δ小时显著改善逼近精度；Rademacher复杂度不增加，估计误差不变；泛化误差在对称函数学习中有明显优势。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构在神经网络中能为对称目标函数带来明确的统计优势，理论分析支持这种结构设计的有效性。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布漂移下往往性能下降，论文旨在探索仅依靠历史数据时模型能否实现对未来数据的泛化。

Method: 研究了两种主要方法：参数插值（历史模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超出历史参数凸包的外推），在语言建模、新闻摘要、卫星图像分类等多个时序任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 实证结果显示，所有评估方法都无法在所有场景中持续优于简单使用最新可用模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据访问或对数据生成过程的强假设时，泛化和外推到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

Motivation: 随着新优化器的流行和模型量化成为高效部署标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能，目前这方面的系统证据仍然有限。

Method: 训练50M到1.5B参数的全精度模型，使用六种优化器探索超参数空间；应用PTQ评估不同优化器训练模型的性能退化；训练量化模型进行QAT研究；推导不同优化器下的量化感知训练缩放定律。

Result: 发现与异常值相关的指标（如MMR和峰度）无法预测不同优化器的PTQ性能；Shampoo在QAT中表现出最低的准确率退化；Shampoo在所有测试优化器中实现了最高的参数效率。

Conclusion: 优化器选择显著影响模型量化鲁棒性，在原始预训练中表现良好的优化器在QAT中可能不是最优选择，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最佳。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Conclusion: IDMVAE通过互补的组件设计，有效解决了多模态数据表示学习中的信息解耦问题，在生成质量和语义连贯性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: 序列感知CNN与特征学习XGBoost的集成框架克服了单独使用无序特征或序列模型的局限性，形成强大的抗生素耐药性预测方法。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Motivation: 传统约束方法如PC假设完美CI测试和穷举搜索，在实际中常被违反导致级联错误。现有LLM方法假设完美专家，但LLM易产生幻觉。

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD在最终图构建中比现有约束方法获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: 通过改进初始种子的可靠性和鲁棒传播策略，MosaCD显著提高了因果发现的准确性。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EVO-LRP使用CMA-ES优化LRP超参数，通过量化可解释性指标提升归因质量，在视觉一致性和类别特征敏感性方面优于传统XAI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，LRP实现通常依赖未优化的启发式规则集，缺乏与模型行为的对齐。

Method: 应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来调整LRP超参数，基于忠实度或稀疏度等量化可解释性指标进行优化。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过原则性、任务特定的优化可以系统性地提升归因质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

*Andres Fernandez,Felix Dangel,Philipp Hennig,Frank Schneider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKETCHLORD方法能够同时估计低秩和对角分量，针对低秩加对角线性算子类，相比顺序估计方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习和科学计算任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵向量乘积访问。现有方法只能构造低秩或对角近似，但存在近似误差。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD建模为凸优化问题，开发可扩展算法同时估计低秩和对角分量。

Result: 理论和实验证明该方法在恢复低秩加对角结构方面表现优异，优于任何顺序变体。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是结构化近似工具包的有价值补充，特别适用于需要高保真近似的大规模算子，如深度学习Hessian矩阵。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个全流程的持续模型融合框架，在融合前、融合中和融合后三个阶段进行干预，解决持续学习中的可扩展性和功能信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每领域任务向量导致可扩展性问题，要么在无法访问旧数据时仅依赖权重空间融合而丢失关键功能信息。

Method: 首先在切线空间中对主模型进行领域特定数据的微调以增强任务权重解耦；融合时利用优化器状态的功能信息；融合后通过校正对齐表示差异。

Result: 在标准类增量学习和领域增量学习基准测试中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了竞争性性能，还为灾难性遗忘问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，同时在不访问历史数据的情况下保持恒定内存约束。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的秩1 EWC方法，结合重放机制来解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在多个图像生成数据集上显著降低了遗忘


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法如重放需要强生成器且易分布漂移，EWC假设任务间共享最优解且使用对角Fisher近似存在局限

Method: 利用扩散模型在低信噪比下梯度共线性的特性，提出秩1 EWC变体，结合重放方法鼓励参数共享并约束漂移

Result: 在MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10、ImageNet-1k等数据集上，平均FID提升，遗忘显著减少，在MNIST和FashionMNIST上几乎消除遗忘，在ImageNet-1k上减少约一半

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩1的Fisher矩阵，改进的Fisher估计使EWC成为重放的有力补充，重放促进任务间参数共享，EWC有效约束重放引起的漂移

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Conclusion: 将线性系统的经典理论与现代学习技术相结合，有望构建鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的时间序列预测模型。

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

TL;DR: 提出GraphIFE框架解决图数据中的类别不平衡问题，通过图不变特征提取缓解合成节点质量不一致问题，提升模型在少数类上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别分布平衡，但在实际图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的学习偏差和性能下降，特别是合成节点质量不一致问题

Method: 提出GraphIFE框架，结合图不变学习的两个关键概念，增强嵌入空间表示，识别不变特征来缓解合成节点质量不一致

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，GraphIFE框架具有高效性和鲁棒泛化能力，始终优于各种基线方法

Conclusion: GraphIFE通过解决合成节点质量不一致问题，有效缓解了图数据中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型在少数类上的性能表现

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统训练评估设置存在信息泄漏和OOD泛化能力差的问题，特别是2x2时空分割允许测试数据通过早停影响模型选择

Method: 采用3x3分区分离训练、验证和测试集，提出DRIK方法在节点层面扰动坐标捕获空间关系，在边层面丢弃边减少信息流模糊性，在子图层面添加伪标签子图增强域泛化

Result: 在6个多样化时空数据集上，DRIK始终优于现有方法，MAE降低达12.48%，同时保持强可扩展性

Conclusion: DRIK通过重新定义评估设置和采用三层面策略，显著提升了时空克里金法的OOD泛化能力

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Conclusion: VN-HGCN不仅是一个有效的异质图学习模型，还可以作为一个通用框架无缝应用于其他HGNN模型，展示了其良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PNS是一个有效的解决方案，能够解决图神经网络中的随机性异常连接问题，同时缓解由节点邻居异常分布引起的性能下降。

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: UAT框架能够有效解决传统早退策略的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著提升推理效率，为自适应推理提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 发现当前偏好对齐实践忽略了参考模型的分布召回能力，导致无法有效对齐稀有但期望的行为

Method: 提出Align->KD新流程：先在高召回参考模型上进行对齐，再进行知识蒸馏；通过理论分析、可控高斯混合实验和LLM实验验证

Result: Align->KD流程在奖励和目标精度上显著优于传统KD->Align，获得更优的目标导向指标和更低方差

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回能力是对齐的一阶设计选择，对齐必须在蒸馏之前进行

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

Motivation: 现有基于超图的方法只能相对表面地捕捉行业相关性，存在两个关键限制：没有充分考虑行业间的领先-滞后相互作用，以及没有建模行业内部和之间的多尺度信息。

Method: Hermes框架集成了移动聚合和多尺度融合模块。使用基于超边的移动聚合模块通过滑动窗口和动态时间聚合操作来捕捉行业间的领先-滞后关系；采用跨尺度边到边消息传递来整合不同尺度的信息。

Result: 在多个真实世界股票数据集上的实验结果表明，Hermes在效率和准确性方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Hermes框架通过更有效地利用行业相关性，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法忽视邻居间信息多样性，导致冗余信息聚合，且仅依赖单一时间尺度的表示进行预测。

Method: 引入多样性感知邻居选择机制(DNSM)确保变量与邻居信息相似但邻居间保持多样性；提出动态多尺度融合模块(DMFM)动态调整不同时间尺度预测结果的贡献。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，DIMIGNN始终优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过解决邻居信息冗余和单一时间尺度依赖问题，有效提升了多元时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对MoE模型的专用缩放定律，通过系统分解识别了5个关键影响因素，构建了考虑所有必要因子的联合MoE缩放定律，并推导了理论和实践最优配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集模型的缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为存在三个关键挑战：影响因素多样性、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响，需要深入研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个对照实验来刻画边际效应，构建全面的联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏；提出的MoE缩放定律能准确指导未来MoE模型设计和训练。

Conclusion: MoE缩放定律为MoE模型提供了准确且深入的指导，解决了现有缩放定律不适用的问题，为参数高效扩展和成本效益部署提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化的动态合作联邦持续学习框架，通过形成动态学习联盟来解决异构环境中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦持续学习中新任务的出现带来了时间和跨客户端的数据分布变化，导致灾难性遗忘。现有方法将客户端知识聚合到全局模型中，但在异构场景下可能引入干扰知识，反而降低客户端性能。

Method: 使用去中心化动态合作框架，客户端基于联盟亲和博弈建立动态合作学习联盟。通过评估客户端梯度一致性和模型相似性来量化合作收益，采用合并阻塞算法和动态合作进化算法实现合作均衡。

Result: 综合实验表明该方法在各种基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的动态合作框架能有效平衡新知识获取和旧知识保留，在联邦持续学习中实现个性化模型优化。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Motivation: 微调后的大语言模型在MLP层中编码了丰富的任务特定特征，但这些表示的形式不清晰，需要研究神经元如何协同工作而非孤立运作。

Method: 使用联盟博弈论框架，将神经元建模为享乐游戏中的智能体，利用top-responsive效用和PAC-Top-Cover算法提取稳定神经元联盟，并跟踪这些联盟在层间的转换模式。

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排器上的应用表明，该方法发现的神经元联盟比聚类基线具有更高的一致性协同效应。

Conclusion: 享乐联盟揭示了超越解缠结的高阶结构，产生了功能重要、可解释且跨领域可预测的计算单元。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

Motivation: 医学影像中严格的隐私法规禁止原始数据共享，联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但面临扫描仪引起的领域偏移问题。现有的领域泛化方法需要集中访问多站点数据，与联邦学习的隐私约束冲突。

Method: 在联邦学习过程中集成领域对抗神经网络，当发现简单的联邦DANN无法收敛时，提出了近端正则化方法来稳定客户端间的对抗训练。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集上的实验表明，在15个站点训练并在19个未见站点测试时，该方法在脑龄预测任务上比FedAvg和ERM具有更好的跨站点泛化能力，同时保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将领域对抗训练集成到联邦学习框架中，有效解决了医学影像中的领域偏移问题，同时严格遵守隐私保护约束。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 研究模型融合对对抗样本迁移性的影响，填补现有研究在迁移攻击方面的空白。

Method: 使用8种MM方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，在336种不同攻击设置下进行综合评估和统计分析。

Result: 发现更强的MM方法会增加对迁移攻击的脆弱性；减轻表示偏差会增加脆弱性；权重平均是最脆弱的MM方法。

Conclusion: 为使用MM设计更安全系统提供关键见解，并分析了脆弱性增加的根本原因及潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型数量的增加，在有限公共数据的领域中，高效识别最适合下游微调的模型变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: 将模型选择重新构建为上下文学习问题，利用数据集元特征、模型特征和微调性能形成表格结构，使用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层熵演化的新型模型特征化方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与真实微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，相比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性评分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic框架能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在下游数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Motivation: 现实世界RL应用多为连续复杂环境，但现有离散时间算法对时间离散化敏感，导致稳定性差和收敛慢。需要将确定性策略梯度方法扩展到连续时间设置。

Method: 基于优势函数的类比推导连续时间策略梯度公式，建立其鞅特征，提出CT-DDPG算法，支持连续时间环境中确定性策略的稳定学习。

Result: 数值实验表明，CT-DDPG相比现有离散时间和连续时间方法，在各种控制任务中具有更好的稳定性和更快的收敛速度，适应不同时间离散化和噪声水平。

Conclusion: CT-DDPG为连续时间RL提供了有效的确定性策略梯度方法，解决了时间离散化敏感性这一关键挑战，在稳定性和收敛速度方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Conclusion: FraudTransformer通过有效结合时间信息和位置信息，在支付欺诈检测任务中表现出色，证明了其在真实银行流数据中的实用性。

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that
can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them.
We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla
GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either
absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional
encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial
dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Method: 提出SAFDNet模型，包含自适应频谱块（利用傅里叶分析提取频域特征并自适应阈值降噪）和交互注意力块（捕捉长短依赖关系）。

Result: 在两个大规模真实数据集上的内外验证显示，SAFDNet达到97.3% AUROC，优于最先进模型，且具有鲁棒性和低噪声敏感性。

Conclusion: SAFDNet在术中低血压早期预警中表现出色，适合临床应用，解决了现有方法的时频域融合、依赖关系捕捉和噪声敏感性问题。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度标记化能实现强连贯性但序列长、复杂度高，而紧凑标记化提高了效率但牺牲了标记内依赖关系。

Method: 采用延迟调度机制(DP)，将类复合标记扩展到多个解码步骤中，实现标记内依赖关系的自回归建模，同时保持效率。DP是一种轻量级策略，无需额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有指标上都优于标准复合标记化，并缩小了与细粒度标记化之间的差距。

Conclusion: 延迟调度机制有效解决了符号音乐生成中的效率-质量权衡问题，在保持效率的同时显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Motivation: 批归一化在深度学习中有重要作用，但在深度强化学习中应用有限，因为DRL数据具有非独立同分布特性和动态变化的分布。本文旨在探索BN在DRL中的潜在优势。

Method: 进行了BN在离策略actor-critic算法中的实证研究，分析了不同训练和评估模式的影响，提出了模式感知批归一化方法，并给出了稳健集成BN的实用建议。

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用，BN可以适应DRL中不断变化的数据分布，提高收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN为BN在DRL中的稳健集成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Motivation: 解决大语言模型后训练中SFT容易记忆化而RL计算成本高的问题，DFT作为折中方案在某些任务中不稳定，需要改进。

Result: ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成任务中一致优于SFT和DFT，实现显著改进且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统性视角，理论分析不仅带来更强保证还产生实际收益。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

*Jiarui Jiang,Wei Huang,Miao Zhang,Taiji Suzuki,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了Mamba状态空间模型在线性回归任务中的上下文学习能力，揭示了其通过在线梯度下降机制实现ICL，与Transformer的梯度下降模拟机制不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为Transformer的高效替代方案在长序列建模中表现出色，但其上下文学习的理论机制尚不明确，限制了对其底层工作原理的深入理解。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构的非凸优化新技术，分析了在线性回归ICL任务中的训练动态，建立了指数收敛率和损失边界。

Result: 证明了Mamba能够以指数速率收敛到ICL解，损失边界与Transformer相当，并揭示了其通过在线梯度下降学习潜在函数的机制。

Conclusion: Mamba通过在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，这与Transformer的梯度下降模拟机制不同，为理解状态空间模型的ICL能力提供了理论依据。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提升准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感。通过分析识别出编辑图像块是脆弱性主要来源，并提出集成Grounding DINO的增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual CoT技术通过整合视觉编辑显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，但其在图像级噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索。

Method: 构建包含12种图像损坏类型和4个VQA数据集的基准测试，系统比较使用和不使用Visual CoT的VLM性能。提出集成Grounding DINO的即插即用鲁棒性增强方法。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和噪声图像上都能提升绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更明显。中间推理组件（编辑图像块）是主要脆弱源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的清晰脆弱模式，并提供了有效的架构无关解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，通过稀疏自编码器对从小数据集提取的转向向量进行语义去噪和增强，解决有限数据下转向向量包含任务无关噪声特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有转向方法依赖大规模数据集学习清晰的行为信息，限制了在现实场景中的应用。从小数据集提取的转向向量往往包含任务无关的噪声特征，影响其有效性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对转向向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义移除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性丰富小数据集中缺失的任务相关特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法（包括监督微调），证明通过SAE精炼原始转向向量可以从有限训练数据构建有效的转向向量。

Conclusion: 通过稀疏自编码器精炼转向向量，可以有效解决小数据集下转向向量包含噪声的问题，提升在有限数据场景下的控制效果。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出STAIR方法解决多阶段任务中偏好强化学习的阶段错位问题，通过时间距离学习阶段近似，优先比较同阶段片段，提升策略学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段任务中，偏好强化学习存在阶段错位问题：比较不同阶段（如移动vs操作）的片段会产生无信息反馈，阻碍策略学习。

Method: STAIR方法：1) 基于时间距离学习阶段近似，使用对比学习将时间相近状态分组为连贯阶段；2) 优先比较同阶段片段，无需预定义任务知识，能动态适应策略变化。

Result: 实验表明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中具有竞争力。人类研究证实STAIR近似的阶段与人类认知一致。

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解了多阶段任务中的阶段错位问题，通过时间距离学习阶段近似，提升了偏好强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架，旨在解决医疗领域联邦学习部署中的实际协调挑战，包括客户端选择、数据预处理、算法选择等操作瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，如客户端选择、协调、数据预处理等。现有研究忽视了这些实际问题，因此需要自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了一个代理驱动的联邦学习框架，涵盖从客户端选择到训练完成的关键阶段，并建立了FedAgentBench基准测试，评估LLM代理在医疗联邦学习中的自主协调能力。框架包含40种FL算法和201个数据集，模拟6种医疗环境。

Result: 评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的性能。结果显示，虽然GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3等代理核心可以自动化联邦学习管道的多个阶段，但基于隐式目标的复杂、相互依赖任务对最强模型仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 代理驱动的联邦学习框架为解决医疗领域联邦学习的实际部署挑战提供了可行方案，但复杂任务的自动化仍需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: 论文挑战了强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，提出在隐藏状态空间中两者可以解耦，并开发了VERL方法通过协同增强来同时提升探索和利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR领域中的探索-利用权衡观点，认为这种权衡可能只是测量层面的假象而非根本约束，旨在揭示同时增强两种能力的可能性。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，通过有效秩及其导数量化探索和利用动态，利用理论上稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器来塑造RL优势函数，创建协同双通道激励结构。

Result: 在多样化LLM和推理基准测试中取得一致提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 在隐藏状态层面探索和利用可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会，VERL方法通过协同激励结构成功实现了这一目标。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tequila是一种针对大语言模型的三元量化方法，通过将死区捕获的权重重新用作动态偏置，解决了传统三元量化导致的精度下降问题，在保持推理效率的同时显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统三元量化方法虽然能通过将权重约束为{-1, 0, 1}来用加法替代昂贵的乘法运算，但过于激进的压缩会导致严重的精度损失，即使经过大量数据的量化感知训练也难以恢复。核心问题是死区捕获现象：大量权重被困在死区边界，只能接收到噪声梯度信号而无法稳定逃离死区。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，通过将死区捕获的权重重新用作动态偏置来重新激活这些权重。这样重新利用的权重在前向传播中能提供连续信号，在反向传播中能接收到直接且有意义的梯度信号，从而增强模型容量和优化效果，且几乎不增加推理开销。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，Tequila都优于最先进的三元量化方法。在ARC基准测试上，相比SOTA基线实现了>4%的准确率提升，几乎匹配全精度性能（差距<1%），同时获得3.0倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: Tequila为在资源受限环境中部署先进大语言模型提供了一种高度实用且高效的实现方案，在保持硬件效率的同时显著缓解了三元量化的精度损失问题。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IndexNet是一个基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过引入索引嵌入模块（包含时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入）来利用描述性信息，提升长期周期模式捕捉能力和变量区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息携带丰富的上下文语义，可以提升多变量时间序列预测的性能。

Method: 提出IndexNet框架，包含索引嵌入模块（IE），该模块由时间戳嵌入（TE）和通道嵌入（CE）组成。TE将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列，CE为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基准上达到可比性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的泛化性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前MTSF研究中仍未被充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN在未见测试图上部署时面临显著性能不确定性，需要评估模型是否适合在特定测试图上进行推理。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异作为监督信号；2）DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计训练好的DGNN在测试时动态图上的性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，DyGEval作为有效评估器，能够准确评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同分布偏移下的动态图上的性能。

Conclusion: DyGEval成功解决了动态图神经网络模型评估问题，为实际部署中模型性能监控提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 传统生成模型忽略了晶体结构的对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性不足且不现实。需要开发能够严格遵循空间群对称性的生成方法。

Method: 使用空间群和Wyckoff位置作为条件，定义对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，通过高效的群平均方法实现对称化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成高度对称的稳定晶体结构，计算开销可忽略，为晶体材料设计提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

Motivation: 标准MoE架构的确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不足和过度自信，使系统无法识别自身知识的局限性

Method: 系统研究三种引入不确定性方法：权重空间、logit空间和选择空间，在30亿参数MoE模型上进行控制实验

Conclusion: 贝叶斯MoE路由框架为构建更鲁棒和自知的LLM提供了实用且计算可行的路径，使模型能够识别自身未知领域

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为鲁棒强化学习提供了有效工具，AD-RRL方法通过条件采样生成对抗性轨迹，成功提升了策略在不确定环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART是一个解耦的GUI代理强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计和自适应数据管理，显著提升了训练效率，在OSWorld基准测试中取得了42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉语言模型的GUI代理在强化学习中面临的两个主要挑战：多轮交互速度慢和高质量交互数据不足。

Method: 将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、滚动服务、数据管理器和训练器，并引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整滚动参数、选择性训练高熵步骤和使用截断重要性采样。

Result: 系统效率显著提升：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量、5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准测试中，DART-GUI-7B达到42.13%任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦架构和自适应数据管理，有效解决了GUI代理强化学习的效率和数据质量问题，为开源社区提供了重要的技术贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [152] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由少量分歧标记驱动，这些标记揭示了早期层的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是为什么在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）中也会出现潜意识学习现象。

Method: 通过控制实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记（教师模型因不同偏见而预测不同标记的罕见情况），并研究早期层在潜意识学习中的作用。

Result: 发现潜意识学习主要由分歧标记驱动，屏蔽这些标记可以消除大部分隐藏偏见传递。早期层对潜意识学习至关重要，即使只微调单个早期层也足以实现潜意识学习。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习是脆弱的，即使像改写提示这样的小改动通常也足以抑制它。分歧标记和早期层在隐藏偏见传递中起关键作用。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的理论，证明在训练具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络时，连续梯度下降（梯度流）具有线性收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论的一个关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已经证明这些方法对少数特定架构具有线性收敛性，但统一的理论仍然缺乏。

Method: 提出了一个统一证明，适用于任何具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络。主要贡献是一个单一通用定理，不仅覆盖了先前未知的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。

Result: 理论结果在无穷小步长限制下是精确的，但在实际步长的梯度下降方法中，理论预测与经验结果表现出良好的一致性。

Conclusion: 该研究为梯度下降方法在训练各种神经网络架构时的线性收敛性提供了统一的理论框架，填补了现有理论的空白。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期大语言模型持续学习中失败，主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出DOC方法：追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，调整新任务参数梯度与历史功能方向正交，减少新旧任务间的干扰。

Result: 在多个大语言模型持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续大语言模型微调提供了鲁棒工具，通过正交化处理成功缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了D-Gating方法，一种完全可微的结构化过参数化技术，通过将权重组分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现结构化稀疏正则化，避免了传统方法的不可微性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能够紧凑神经网络，但其不可微性导致与随机梯度下降不兼容，需要专门优化器或后处理剪枝，缺乏形式化保证。

Method: D-Gating方法将每个权重组分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，通过可微的过参数化实现结构化稀疏，证明其局部最小值与非平滑结构化L2,2/D惩罚等价。

Result: 理论证明D-Gating在梯度流极限下至少以指数速度收敛到L2,2/D正则化损失，在视觉、语言和表格任务中始终提供优异的性能-稀疏度权衡，优于直接优化结构化惩罚和传统剪枝基线。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题，但诱导了从非稀疏到稀疏优化的独特学习动态，为结构化稀疏提供了可微且理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Conclusion: 所提出的集成通信与控制协同设计机制能有效提升无人机群在复杂环境中的通信质量和能效，为应急救援等临时场景提供可靠通信保障。

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 开发一个能够学习稀疏时间序列数据，同时保持可解释性和表达能力的框架，在保持模型性能的同时提供可操作的领域对齐解释。

Method: 将每个时间相关轨迹表示为有向图，应用增强的图神经加法网络(GNANs)，通过特征和图的分组来控制可解释性-表达能力的权衡。

Result: 在真实世界数据集（包括血液检测死亡率预测和假新闻检测）上，GMAN优于强大的不可解释黑盒基线，同时提供可操作的领域对齐解释。

Conclusion: GMAN框架成功地在保持高性能的同时提供了多层次的可解释性，证明了在复杂时间序列任务中可解释模型可以超越黑盒方法。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS是一种用于加速视觉语言模型推理的推测解码方法，通过将视觉令牌从草稿器输入中移除，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息，显著减少了草稿器的预填充序列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在适应视觉语言模型时面临挑战，因为视觉令牌会导致草稿器和目标VLM之间的语义表示不匹配，并且大量视觉令牌会显著减慢草稿器的自注意力计算。

Method: 提出显式-隐式输入分解框架，从草稿器输入中移除所有视觉令牌，仅使用文本令牌作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的对应最后一层隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息。采用多步自反馈训练策略进行高效训练。

Result: 将草稿器的预填充序列长度压缩到目标VLM输入的仅0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量。在多样化模型和任务上的实验显示最高可达2.65倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: HiViS通过有效处理视觉令牌问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速了视觉语言模型的推理过程，证实了该方法在VLM加速方面的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Motivation: 当前MoE架构研究主要关注性能表现，对其内部机制理解有限，这限制了该领域的进一步发展。本文旨在深入探索MoE架构的内部工作机制。

Method: 使用内部指标MUI来研究MoE架构，明确纳入路由机制并分析专家级行为，系统分析多种公开可用的MoE模型。

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型演进下降反映更强泛化能力；训练过程呈现动态轨迹；任务完成来自多专家协作，共享专家驱动集中；神经元激活模式可作为数据多样性细粒度代理。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为MoE模型的容量、动态性和专业化提供新见解，展示了MUI在理解MoE架构内部机制方面的潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

Motivation: 传统CoT方法将高层策略规划与低层逐步执行混在一起，导致计算效率低、推理路径探索有限和可解释性差。E²C旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：监督微调（SFT）结合强化学习（RL），探索阶段随机生成简洁高级计划，执行阶段确定性执行选定计划。

Conclusion: E²C通过分离规划与执行，实现了高效推理、强泛化能力和更好的可解释性，显著减少了自一致性开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

TL;DR: 提出了DiBS-MTL方法，一种基于方向性谈判解决方案的多任务学习算法，能够抵抗任务损失非仿射变换的影响，在标准MTL基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务学习算法通过加权平均组合任务损失或梯度，但任务损失的任意非仿射缩放会导致某些任务主导训练，从而降低整体性能。需要一种对单调非仿射变换具有不变性的方法。

Method: 基于合作博弈理论中的方向性谈判解决方案(DiBS)，提出了DiBS-MTL算法。该方法在非凸多任务学习设置下保证子序列收敛到帕累托稳定点，并保持计算效率。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法表现相当，同时对非仿射单调变换具有鲁棒性，而现有方法（包括先前受谈判启发的MTL方法）在此类变换下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL为多任务学习提供了一种对任务损失缩放具有不变性的有效解决方案，解决了任务主导问题，并在理论和实证上都表现出色。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

TL;DR: 本文验证了Chinchilla缩放定律的可靠性，发现尽管存在模型参数定义模糊等问题，但其核心结果（缩放定律估计和计算最优的token-参数比例）具有鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Chinchilla论文提出的计算最优缩放原则在后续研究中受到质疑（如宽置信区间、方法间不一致等），本文旨在验证这些缩放定律是否仍然可靠。

Method: 首先识别Chinchilla分析中模型参数的三种可能解释，然后通过四种结构化方式故意扰动模型参数，评估关键结果的敏感性。

Result: 发现模型参数的不同解释对关键结果影响不大，最优token-参数比例在目标计算预算下更加恒定；关键结果对加性或系统性误差最敏感，但总体上能承受显著扰动。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的缩放定律仍然可以作为语言模型扩展的可靠指导，为领域提供了更新的信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架，直接从CDM规范生成功能正确且gas优化的Solidity智能合约，相比未优化基准在测试数据上实现了高达35.59%的gas成本降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化能带来显著效率提升，但将金融规范转化为gas高效的可执行代码的复杂性限制了实际应用。从高级规范（如CDM）生成既功能正确又经济可行的代码仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，使用PPO代理从预定义库中选择最优代码片段。通过两阶段课程学习：首先训练代理实现功能正确性，然后转向gas优化，以管理复杂的搜索空间。

Result: RL代理学会了生成具有显著gas节省的合约，在未见测试数据上相比未优化基准实现了高达35.59%的成本降低。

Conclusion: 这项工作为自动化合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

TL;DR: 提出了GUIDE框架，通过集成LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法（如PC、GES、ICA-LiNGAM）在节点可扩展性（超过70节点）、计算能耗和混合数据类型处理方面存在严重限制，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: GUIDE采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: 相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法，GUIDE平均减少约42%的运行时间；相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG，平均提高约117%的准确性，并能扩展到≥70节点的设置。

Conclusion: GUIDE在计算效率、准确性和可扩展性方面显著优于现有方法，特别是在处理混合数据类型和大规模节点设置时表现突出。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：当使用带有虚假相关性的下游任务中较弱教师的伪标签来微调强大的预训练学生模型时，弱到强泛化是否会发生以及如何改进失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性时，弱到强泛化是否有效，并解决当未标记数据与标记数据的群体分布不匹配时可能出现的失败情况。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下的弱到强泛化增益，并通过实验验证。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在弱到强微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当未标记数据与标记数据的少数群体比例相等时，弱到强泛化总能发生；但当比例不相等时可能失败，且泛化增益随比例差异的平方而减少。实验验证了理论结果，提出的算法在多种虚假相关性基准和师生对上都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体分布匹配时有效，但在分布不匹配时可能失败。提出的高置信度数据重训练算法无需群体标签，能显著提升弱到强泛化性能。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算和跳过处理，实现20倍注意力计算减少，在保持生成质量的同时显著加速扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型中，由于长序列长度和二次复杂度，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈。研究发现注意力权重可分为高秩大权重和低秩小权重两部分，这自然建议对前者应用稀疏加速，对后者应用低秩加速。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分为关键权重（应用O(N²)注意力）、边缘权重（应用O(N)线性注意力）和可忽略权重（跳过）。将这些计算融合到单个GPU内核中，支持前向和后向传播，只需少量微调步骤。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B模型上实现13.7倍注意力计算加速和2.2倍端到端视频生成加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，有效解决了扩散模型中注意力计算瓶颈问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著的计算加速。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种不同的预训练缩放定律来拟合生成式评估中的pass-at-k指标，并预测最昂贵模型的性能。研究发现生成式评估提供了新的超参数k来控制缩放定律参数和性能可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注判别式评估的缩放定律，而生成式评估（如数学问题解决、软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出并评估三种预训练缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律 (2) 基于模型参数和token的缩放定律 (3) 基于黄金参考解对数似然的缩放定律

Result: 计算量缩放定律和参数+token缩放定律在最后约1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后约5个数量级稳定。三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算量缩放定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然在大k时预测稍差。

Conclusion: 建立了计算量缩放定律作为参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络的理论联系，为研究人员提供了预测生成性能的方法论和洞察。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Motivation: 基础模型在文本、视觉和视频理解方面取得了显著进展，现在有望在轨迹建模领域实现类似突破。作者旨在开发一个能够捕捉人类移动正常模式的大规模移动数据基础模型。

Method: GPS-MTM将移动性分解为两种互补模态：状态（兴趣点类别）和行动（代理转移）。使用双向Transformer和自监督掩码建模目标，模型能够重建跨模态的缺失片段，无需手动标签即可学习丰富的语义关联。

Result: 在Numosim-LA、Urban Anomalies和Geolife等基准数据集上，GPS-MTM在轨迹填充和下一站预测等下游任务中持续优于其他方法。在动态任务（逆向和正向动态）中优势最为明显，这些任务需要上下文推理。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM被确立为轨迹分析的稳健基础模型，将移动数据定位为大规模表示学习的一流模态。代码已发布供进一步参考。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体强化学习中的风险规避方法往往导致次优均衡，而现有的乐观方法虽然有效但缺乏理论基础。需要建立理论严谨的乐观框架来促进合作。

Method: 基于凸风险度量的对偶表示，提出乐观价值函数框架，将其形式化为发散惩罚的风险寻求评估。推导了乐观价值函数的策略梯度定理，并开发了分散式乐观actor-critic算法。

Result: 在合作基准测试中，风险寻求的乐观方法相比风险中性基线和启发式乐观方法，持续改善了协调性能。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的合作提供了理论基础和实际有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过让设备端LLM自主决策路由，有效提升了设备-云协作的效率和性能。

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

Motivation: 现有的离线强化学习方法通常依赖单一的全局Q函数，难以捕捉包含多样化子任务的组合性质任务。

Method: 将Q学习构建为上下文推理问题，使用线性Transformer从检索的转移中自适应推断局部Q函数，无需显式子任务标签。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线强化学习提供了一个原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 由于描述室内养殖池周围空气环境的公共数据集稀缺，限制了结合空气条件和水质动态的预测与异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用Awair HOME监测器在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中每5分钟采样一次，采用ISO标准安装高度，通过参考仪器进行校准检查，并使用开源处理流程进行数据标准化。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据中心的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

TL;DR: PEARL是一个基于设备端LLM的D2D通信协作跨层优化框架，通过利用发布者和订阅者状态来指导Wi-Fi Aware参数选择，在合成场景中相比基线方法提升了目标分数，并在协作低电量情况下节能高达16%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备设备端LLM范式，利用对等设备感知的上下文信息来优化D2D通信性能，解决传统方法在跨层控制中的局限性。

Method: 提出PEARL框架，使用上下文感知奖励（基于应用容忍度归一化延迟和基于设备电池状态调制能耗）进行KL微调，研究两种轻量变体：PEARL（Head+LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）。

Result: PEARL在基于真实测量的合成场景中优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，PEARL-Lite在20ms内完成推理且目标分数相近，在协作低电量情况下节能高达16%。

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头部的高效性使LLM适用于持续运行的设备端跨层控制。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决了现有等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局注意力机制是transformer架构成功的关键，但计算成本随token数量呈二次增长。等变模型在物理、生化、计算机视觉和机器人任务中通常能获得更高精度，但计算需求较大。现有等变transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了其表达能力和性能。

Method: 使用新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，通过利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性，能够很好地扩展到高阶不可约特征，并可选地通过权重共享或数据增强实现token置换等变性。

Result: 在n体模拟、QM9、ModelNet点云分类和机器人抓取数据集等多个基准测试中，相比现有等变transformer，在GPU内存大小、速度和准确性方面都显示出明显优势，实现了O(N log N)的输入token复杂度。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer能够高效建模所有阶的等变特征，同时保持较低的计算复杂度，在多个任务中优于现有方法，为等变transformer提供了更强大的表达能力。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Motivation: 传统第一性原理方法计算点缺陷性质成本高昂，而现有基于GNN的机器学习力场存在过平滑和长程相互作用表示不足的问题，特别是在处理点缺陷时尤为突出。

Method: 提出ADAPT模型，用直接坐标空间表示替代图表示，考虑所有原子对相互作用，将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模原子间相互作用。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过改进原子表示和相互作用建模方式，有效解决了GNN在点缺陷建模中的局限性，为材料缺陷研究提供了更高效准确的计算工具。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，GeoFunFlow在复杂几何体上实现了最先进的重建精度，提供了校准的不确定性量化，相比算子学习和扩散模型基线具有更高的推理效率。

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow框架有效解决了复杂几何体上PDE逆问题的挑战，为科学和工程应用提供了高效、准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为一个可扩展和泛化的解决方案，适用于现实世界的医疗应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型在捕捉长期时间依赖性和计算效率之间存在权衡，而传统回声状态网络虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限。

Method: 提出EFNs框架，包含扩展回声状态网络(X-ESNs)和MLP读出层，采用新颖的矩阵门控复合随机激活(MCRA)机制，并设计了双流架构来动态选择特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，EFNs比PatchTST等领先方法训练速度快4倍，模型大小小3倍，预测误差从43%降至35%，相对改进20%。EchoFormer在ETTh等数据集上达到新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: EFNs框架成功解决了时间序列预测中效率与表达能力之间的权衡问题，为长序列建模提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Conclusion: 局部核技术能够有效分离不同概率分布的支撑集，为分类问题提供了新的理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是基于集成的分类器，为传统预报方法提供了有效且可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上有基础、实践中可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，解决了现有方法的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Motivation: 解决自编码器设计中保持数据在潜在空间中几何结构的关键挑战，现有方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，导致全局方法存在距离近似误差累积，局部方法收敛到扭曲大规模关系的次优解。

Method: 提出多尺度几何自编码器(MAE)，采用非对称架构，在编码器应用全局距离约束，在解码器应用局部几何约束，同时保持两个尺度的几何结构。通过理论分析验证这种非对称设计与编码器和解码器不同角色的自然对齐。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的综合实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAE通过非对称设计有效解决了自编码器中几何结构保持的问题，在多个数据集上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

Conclusion: RSP是第一个用于模型相关性检测的原则性通用统计框架，能够在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and

### [191] [FM-FoG: A Real-Time Foundation Model-based Wearable System for Freezing-of-Gait Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24176)
*Chuntian Chi,John Clapham,Leslie Cloud,Ingrid Pretzer-Aboff,GinaMari Blackwell,Huajie Shao,Gang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-FoG是一个基于基础模型的实时可穿戴系统，能够在未见过的帕金森患者中检测冻结步态，无需患者特定训练，实现了98.5%的F1分数和72%的电池续航提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态影响超过50%的中晚期帕金森患者，显著损害患者行动独立性。现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床部署。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要计算。

Result: 在VCU FoG-IMU数据集上对23名PD患者进行评估，在未见过的患者中达到98.5%的F1分数，显著优于基线方法。在Google Pixel 8a手机上部署，电池续航提升72%，干预延迟低于20ms。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现实用、节能的医疗应用，无需个体训练要求即可跨患者泛化。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现Wasserstein神经元在大型语言模型中具有关键作用，这些神经元通过负预激活空间区分相似输入，特别是语法标记，对模型语法功能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中少数关键神经元（Wasserstein神经元）的功能机制，特别是它们在语法处理中的独特作用。

Method: 通过靶向移除Wasserstein神经元、零化负预激活值等干预实验，结合词性分析和层特异性干预来研究这些神经元的功能。

Result: 靶向干预Wasserstein神经元的负预激活会显著削弱模型功能并破坏语法行为，而随机控制组影响较小；语法支架标记的意外性增加，局部退化在深度上累积。

Conclusion: 稀疏的纠缠神经元中的负分化是语言模型依赖的关键语法机制，这些神经元在训练过程中出现并稳定下来。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

TL;DR: 本文从第一性原理推导了群组相对REINFORCE算法，揭示了其天然的离策略特性，并提出了正则化策略更新和主动塑造数据分布两个通用原则，为LLM的离策略强化学习提供了新的理论视角和算法设计机会。

Motivation: 现实应用中的约束、LLM-RL基础设施的复杂性以及RL方法学创新的需求，推动了对大语言模型离策略强化学习的兴趣增长。传统REINFORCE及其变体通常被认为是在策略算法，对离策略性容忍有限。

Method: 通过第一性原理推导群组相对REINFORCE算法，不假设特定训练数据分布，展示其天然的离策略解释。提出正则化策略更新和主动塑造数据分布两个适应离策略设置的通用原则。

Result: 分析揭示了重要性采样和裁剪在GRPO中的真实作用，统一并重新解释了OPMD和AsymRE算法作为REINFORCE损失的正则化形式，为看似启发式的数据加权策略提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 研究结果为LLM的离策略RL提供了可操作的见解，并通过实证研究验证，为原则性算法设计开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker是一个基于大语言模型的抑郁症诊断框架，通过监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力，在UK Biobank数据集上训练，显著优于传统方法和通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观评估，缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力。大语言模型有潜力提高诊断准确性，但面临可解释性、幻觉和依赖合成数据等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，结合监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力。使用UK Biobank数据集生成40,000个推理样本，并补充10,000个公开心理健康数据集样本进行微调。

Result: MDD-Thinker准确率达0.8268，F1分数0.8081，显著优于SVM、MLP等传统方法和通用LLM。结合SFT和RL带来29.0%准确率、38.1% F1分数和34.8% AUC的相对提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强LLM抑郁症诊断框架，平衡了准确性、可解释性和效率，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Conda优化器，通过列归一化结合Adam的坐标自适应性和Muon的谱归一化优势，在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上实现2-2.5倍于AdamW的收敛速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器在LLM预训练中存在谱条件差和低秩结构问题，Muon通过全局谱归一化解决但缺乏坐标自适应，需要结合两者优势

Method: Conda将更新投影到正交子空间，基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，同时改善谱条件和保持坐标自适应

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上，Conda在预训练中持续优于AdamW、Muon等基线，在LLaMA系列上达到AdamW 2-2.5倍的收敛速度

Conclusion: Conda是LLM大规模训练中有效且广泛适用的优化器，在各种训练设置下都表现出鲁棒性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入意外伪影，难以在预训练文本到图像模型中有效编辑图像内容

Method: 通过使用相同相关噪声驱动源图像和编辑图像，利用耦合SDEs引导采样过程，适用于扩散模型和整流流模型等可被SDE采样的预训练模型

Result: 该方法无需重新训练或辅助网络即可工作，实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级的视觉一致性

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PU学习算法实验设置高度不一致，难以确定哪种算法性能更好，需要建立系统性的基准来公平比较。

Method: 提出PU学习基准框架，系统研究PU学习的模型选择标准，识别单样本和双样本设置之间的差异，并提出校准方法解决内部标签偏移问题。

Result: 创建了首个PU学习基准，提供了可访问、现实和公平的评估环境，能够确保算法在相同条件下进行公平比较。

Conclusion: 该基准框架为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化环境，有助于推动PU学习领域的发展。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ChessArena测试平台来评估大语言模型的战略推理能力，发现当前LLMs在象棋战略推理方面存在显著不足，没有一个模型能击败业余人类水平的象棋引擎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正具备复杂战略推理能力，还是仅仅擅长训练数据中的模式识别，特别是象棋这种需要长期规划、严格规则理解和多轮对话记忆的复杂推理任务。

Method: 构建ChessArena竞争框架，让LLMs在四种不同游戏模式下相互对战，配备排名算法和排行榜，评估基础理解、走子选择和谜题解决等细粒度能力。

Result: 评估了13个不同模式的LLMs，进行了800多场比赛，结果显示当前LLMs存在显著缺陷：没有模型能击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100象棋引擎，有些甚至无法击败随机走子的玩家。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂战略推理方面仍有很大改进空间，但通过微调的Qwen3-8B模型性能大幅提升，接近最先进的大型推理模型水平。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Motivation: 将预训练-迁移范式扩展到图结构上的运筹学问题面临挑战，因为语言的统计灵活性与图的严格组合约束之间存在根本冲突。

Method: 引入LLM式的自监督预训练范式，在图中的随机游走路径上进行训练，使GFM内化图的复杂拓扑和组合规则，将结构连通性本身作为监督信号。

Result: 在20到893个节点的网络上进行的全面实验表明，GFM在各种不同的优化任务类别中与专用求解器相比具有竞争性性能，同时保持显著更快的推理时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果在玩家行为中不可直接观察，缺乏可靠标记数据，且作弊者会限制或伪装作弊行为，这给检测和检测器开发带来挑战。

Method: 将作弊者和非作弊者建模为具有不同可观察性水平的强化学习代理，检测器对其行为轨迹进行分类。将作弊者与检测器的交互制定为对抗性游戏，引入结构化作弊者模型，根据检测风险动态切换作弊和非作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明，该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，这些行为在奖励优化和检测规避之间进行战略性平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了一个可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

Motivation: 现有方法难以将语言指令作为先验约束纳入EEG表示学习，限制了利用语言语义知识统一不同标签和任务的能力。

Method: 预训练阶段使用联合谱-时域重建模块，结合频率掩码和两种互补的时域目标；指令调优阶段提出指令条件Q-Former，通过可学习查询将指令嵌入注入EEG标记并与文本标签嵌入对齐。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式强化学习在异步并行计算和通信瓶颈下的理论探索不足，特别是在存在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈的情况下，需要开发高效的分布式策略梯度方法。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：Rennala NIGT在同构设置下支持AllReduce操作，改进计算和通信复杂度；Malenia NIGT在异构设置下同时处理异步计算和异构环境。

Result: 在理论保证方面，两种算法都优于现有方法，实验结果表明显著优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的Rennala NIGT和Malenia NIGT算法在分布式强化学习中有效解决了异步计算和通信瓶颈问题，在异构环境下具有更好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

TL;DR: 本研究使用科学机器学习框架结合通用微分方程预测土壤有机碳动态，在无噪声和中等噪声条件下表现优异，但在高噪声情况下出现过拟合或过度平滑问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳对土壤健康和全球气候韧性至关重要，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 采用基于通用微分方程的科学机器学习框架，结合机械物理过程（如平流扩散传输）和神经网络学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸过程，使用合成数据集系统评估六种实验情况。

Result: 在无噪声和7%噪声条件下，模型准确重建SOC动态（MSE=1.6e-5，R²=0.9999）；但在35%噪声条件下出现过拟合（R²=0.94）或过度平滑（负R²）问题。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适合可扩展、噪声容忍的SOC预测，但实际部署需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学集成。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALT提出了一种两阶段的视频表示学习方法，使用固定教师模型替代EMA更新，通过像素重建训练教师编码器，然后让学生预测教师模型的潜在表示，在计算效率和性能上都优于V-JEPA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA方法使用EMA更新的教师模型来防止表示崩溃，但这限制了模型选择的扩展性并耦合了师生架构。作者希望探索是否可以使用固定的教师模型来简化训练过程。

Method: 提出SALT方法：第一阶段用像素重建目标训练教师编码器，第二阶段冻结教师模型，让学生预测教师模型在掩码区域的潜在表示，形成两阶段无正则化训练方案。

Result: SALT方法在多个基准测试中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，在相同FLOPs下获得更高的探测准确率，且学生模型对教师模型质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SALT是一种简单、可扩展且计算高效的视频表示学习方法，可作为基于EMA自蒸馏的替代方案，建议将计算预算主要分配给学生模型训练。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

*Dipan Maity*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AuON优化器，通过非线性缩放和归一化实现线性时间复杂度的正交梯度更新，避免了传统O(n^3)正交化方法的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高（O(n^3)），且动量应用受限；现有方法如Muon虽降低到O(n^2)但仍不够高效。

Method: 利用动量更新的半正交特性，在谱范数信任域内约束动量更新，结合双曲余弦RMS缩放变换和归一化，避免显式半正交化。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体性能与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当。

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的正交梯度更新方法，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: H+是一种新颖的相似性感知聚合方法，在联邦学习中有效防御拜占庭攻击，无需干净数据即可运行，且计算复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到拜占庭攻击，现有相似性感知方法需要干净数据，但在实际场景中干净数据往往不可得。

Method: H+随机选择参数向量的r维片段，使用相似性检查函数H与参考向量比较，保留最相似的客户端向量进行聚合，重复K次以识别诚实客户端。

Result: 实验验证H+在多种拜占庭攻击比例和类型下，在所有评估场景和基准数据集上都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H+是当前最先进的联邦学习防御方法，无需干净数据即可提供强大的拜占庭攻击鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 提出iMOOE方法，通过物理引导的不变学习来提升PDE系统在未知分布场景下的零样本泛化能力，无需测试时适应样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在PDE系统参数多变的情况下，零样本OOD泛化能力不足，仍需测试时样本进行领域适应，因为尚未充分探索PDE动力学系统中的基本物理不变性。

Method: 首先明确定义两重PDE不变性原理（成分算子及其组合关系不变），然后提出iMOOE方法，包含不变性对齐的算子专家混合架构和频率增强的不变学习目标。

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中验证了iMOOE在分布内性能的优越性，以及在多样化OOD预测场景下的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: iMOOE通过捕捉PDE系统的物理不变性，显著提升了零样本OOD泛化能力，为科学和工程问题中的PDE动力学预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多目标进化学习框架，通过将多个多样性指标作为不同目标来优化游戏关卡生成模型的训练，从而增强多维多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有游戏关卡生成方法往往无法全面评估多个维度的多样性，而多样性指标之间存在冲突、互补或混合关系，需要更全面的多样性评估方法。

Method: 将模型训练制定为多目标学习问题，每个多样性指标作为独立目标，并提出多目标进化学习框架同时优化多个多样性指标。

Result: 在超级马里奥兄弟基准测试中，该框架能够增强多维多样性，并识别生成模型的帕累托前沿，在可玩性和两个代表性多样性指标之间提供权衡范围。

Conclusion: 该框架使决策者能够根据各种场景以及玩家和设计师的多样化需求，做出明智的生成器选择。

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

### [210] [Watermarking Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24368)
*Thibaud Gloaguen,Robin Staab,Nikola Jovanović,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对扩散语言模型(DLMs)的水印方案，解决了传统自回归语言模型水印方法无法直接应用于DLMs的问题，通过期望上下文和提升水印强度来实现可靠的水印检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(DLMs)能够以任意顺序生成token，这与传统的自回归语言模型(ARLMs)顺序生成方式不同。现有的ARLM水印方案依赖先前生成的token，无法直接应用于DLM设置，因此需要专门为DLMs设计水印方案。

Method: 通过两种方式解决DLM水印挑战：(1)在上下文token尚未确定时，在期望上应用水印；(2)提升那些在作为其他token上下文时能增加水印强度的token。同时保持水印检测器不变。

Result: 实验评估显示，DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，对质量影响极小，并且达到了与现有ARLM水印相似的鲁棒性，首次实现了可靠的DLM水印。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了首个专门针对扩散语言模型的水印方案，解决了传统方法无法直接应用的问题，为DLMs提供了可靠的水印保护机制。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次成功将进化策略（ES）扩展到大型语言模型（LLM）的全参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于强化学习（RL）微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）曾在百万参数级模型上表现出与强化学习（RL）相当的性能，但由于被认为难以扩展到更大模型而被忽视。本文旨在验证ES在大规模LLM微调中的可行性。

Method: 采用进化策略（ES）对预训练大型语言模型进行全参数微调，探索其在数十亿参数规模下的搜索效率。

Result: ES在样本效率、长时程奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励黑客攻击倾向性降低以及跨运行稳定性等多个方面优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: ES为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明其在大规模参数优化中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS是一个通过条件化冻结LLM进行时间序列异常检测的框架，通过三种提示增强LLM对时间序列的理解，解决了传统时间到文本序列化中的上下文缺失和对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列异常检测需要提供不仅检测异常，还要解释异常模式和原因的解释。虽然LLMs具有强大的解释能力，但直接处理连续时间序列信号存在困难。

Method: AXIS框架通过三种提示来增强LLM输入：符号数字提示用于数值基础、上下文集成的时间序列编码器提示捕获细粒度动态、任务先验提示编码全局异常特征。

Result: 实验表明AXIS产生的解释质量显著更高，检测精度与通用LLM、专业时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AXIS成功解决了LLM处理时间序列的挑战，提供了高质量的解释和竞争性的检测性能，并通过新基准促进了可解释性评估。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练小型到中型Transformer解码器时，相比AdamW节省48-52%的计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。与MLA和MoE结合时，能实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Muon优化器在训练Transformer时的理论基础、收敛特性和与现代架构优化的协同作用，验证其在计算效率方面的优势。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析，包括收敛速率、谱正则化特性、与Stiefel流形上自然梯度下降的联系，以及谱范数下的最速梯度下降等价性。结合MLA和MoE进行实证研究。

Result: Muon在保持数据效率的同时扩展了帕累托边界，与AdamW相比节省近一半训练计算量。MLA+MoE+Muon组合实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速，困惑度改善8-12%。

Conclusion: Muon是一个有原则、稳健的AdamW替代方案，特别在与现代效率技术和大批量训练机制结合时表现出色。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法独立建模空间或时间依赖关系，导致表示学习不优且对高维空间中异常分散的敏感性有限。实证分析显示正常和异常样本在高维空间中都会散射，异常样本尤其分散。

Method: 提出ScatterAD，包含拓扑编码器捕获图结构散射，时间编码器通过最小化相邻时间步的均方误差来约束过度散射。引入对比融合机制确保时间和拓扑表示的互补性。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ScatterAD在多元时间序列异常检测上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过最大化时间和拓扑视图之间的条件互信息，可以提高跨视图一致性并增强更具区分性的表示，从而有效提升异常检测性能。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

TL;DR: BiHDTrans是一种高效的神经符号二元超维Transformer，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，结合了HD计算的高效表示和Transformer的时间建模能力，在资源受限的边缘环境中实现准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，利用全息高维空间的二值化特性，在FPGA上进行硬件加速，利用高维表示的独立同分布特性实现流水线处理。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二元Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。在FPGA上实现39.4倍的低延迟推理。即使维度减少64%，仍能保持竞争力，模型大小减少4.4倍，延迟进一步降低49.8%。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans成功弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，为资源受限的边缘环境提供了准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法能够在不影响性能的情况下实现显著压缩。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

*Yingshi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种进化框架训练大语言模型，将模型分为多个专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家并通过进化算子学习最佳专家经验，最终只保存最佳专家权重，大幅减少模型推理大小和训练内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练内存需求大、推理模型体积大的问题，通过专家进化方法实现高效训练和轻量化部署。

Method: 将LLM划分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家，使用AdamW优化后通过交叉、粒子群优化和变异等进化算子让当前专家学习最佳专家的经验。

Result: 最佳专家能达到与完整模型几乎相同的准确率，训练内存需求大幅降低，吞吐量提升10倍以上，模型推理大小显著减小。

Conclusion: 该进化框架能有效减少LLM训练内存需求和推理模型体积，同时保持模型性能，适合在PC和边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不平衡Wasserstein距离的分布鲁棒联邦学习方法，能够同时处理分布偏移和异常值影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在数据分布扰动下性能会显著下降，现有基于DRO的方法往往忽略了本地数据集中异常值对模型的负面影响。

Method: 使用不平衡Wasserstein距离构建模糊集，结合KL惩罚来减轻异常值影响，将问题重构为可处理的拉格朗日惩罚优化问题。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的分布异常值鲁棒联邦学习算法具有收敛保证，能够有效处理分布偏移和异常值问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: KREPES是一个通过Nyström近似实现可扩展核表示学习的统一框架，解决了核方法在大规模无标签数据表示学习中的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法具有强大的理论基础和统计保证，但其可扩展性长期以来受到时间和内存成本的限制。在基础模型时代，需要从海量无标签数据中学习表示，但缺乏可扩展的基于核的表示学习框架。

Method: 通过Nyström近似构建统一的核表示学习框架KREPES，支持广泛的非监督和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在大型图像和表格数据集上的实验证明了KREPES的高效性，并且能够提供学习表示的原则性可解释性。

Conclusion: KREPES为核方法在大规模表示学习中提供了可行的解决方案，相比深度模型具有更好的可解释性优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FS-KAN，一种针对任意置换对称群构建等变和不变KA层的原则性方法，统一并显著扩展了该领域先前的工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然等变KAN已在特定数据类型中得到探索，但在一般情境下对具有置换对称性的数据应用的原则性框架仍然缺失。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置来推导FS-KAN层的基本构造，并提供理论分析证明FS-KAN具有与标准参数共享层相同的表达能力。

Result: 在多种数据类型和对称群上的实证评估显示，FS-KAN相比标准参数共享层表现出更优越的数据效率，在某些情况下优势显著，同时保持了KAN的可解释性和适应性。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在低数据场景下是一个优秀的架构选择，结合了等变网络的对称性优势与KAN的可解释性和表达能力。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: SMoPE是一个新颖的持续学习框架，通过稀疏混合专家架构组织共享提示，仅激活相关专家子集来平衡任务特定提示的性能和共享提示的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中任务特定提示方法计算开销大、内存需求随任务线性增长，而共享提示方法存在知识干扰导致性能下降的问题。

Method: 将共享提示组织为多个提示专家，使用提示注意力分数聚合机制动态选择相关专家，采用自适应噪声机制平衡专家利用，并设计基于原型的损失函数增强专家专业化。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准测试中，SMoPE始终优于任务特定提示方法，性能与最先进方法相当，同时显著减少参数数量和计算成本。

Conclusion: SMoPE成功调和了任务特定提示和共享提示策略之间的权衡，在保持高性能的同时实现了计算和内存效率的提升。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

TL;DR: GUIDE是一个轻量级的证据学习元模型方法，可以附加到冻结的深度学习模型上，明确学习如何以及何时表达不确定性，无需重新训练或修改基础模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布外不确定性量化仍然是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有的事后方法要么继承错误置信度，要么仅重塑预测，而没有教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动的课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。不需要重新训练、架构修改或手动中间层选择。

Result: GUIDE避免了从基础模型中蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高了约77%，对抗攻击检测提高了约80%，同时保持分布内性能。在多个基准测试中始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE证明了主动引导不确定性的必要性，以缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距，具有广泛的适用性和最小的用户干预。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM DNA概念，将大语言模型的功能行为表示为低维、双Lipschitz表示，用于分析模型间的演化关系，并构建了LLM进化树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型数量爆炸式增长但演化关系不明确的问题，现有方法受限于任务特定性、固定模型集或对分词器和架构的严格假设。

Method: 数学定义LLM DNA作为功能行为的低维表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论特性，并开发了无需训练的可扩展DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前研究一致，在特定任务上表现优异，并揭示了未记录的模型关系，构建的进化树反映了架构演变和时间进程。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为分析大语言模型演化关系提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够揭示模型间的遗传关系和进化模式。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对TTT为何有效缺乏理解，传统解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据，但基础模型规模扩大和大多数测试数据为分布内数据质疑了这些解释。

Method: 在线性表示假设下提出理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 实证验证了语义相关数据点仅由少数共享概念解释，TTT在分布内测试误差上显著优于全局训练，识别了专业化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: 基础模型在全局上参数不足，TTT通过专业化机制在泛化后聚焦测试任务相关概念，是提升性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型开发过度关注效能指标，导致大规模模型需要大量资源，产生显著的碳足迹。研究旨在探索物理归纳偏置如何提供模型效能与效率之间的有益权衡。

Method: 研究了多种时空预测模型，包括标准物理信息模型和更近期的流匹配模型，通过将物理归纳偏置嵌入模型设计来平衡效能与效率。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置可以在保持甚至提高任务效能的同时，显著提升模型效率（计算、能源和碳足迹）。

Conclusion: 物理归纳偏置为提升机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法，模型效率应与模型效能一起成为机器学习模型开发和部署的核心考量。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

TL;DR: LEAF是一个用于少样本持续事件检测的专家混合框架，通过LoRA参数化专家、语义感知路由和对比学习来解决灾难性遗忘和有限数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因完全微调共享基础模型而导致知识干扰和灾难性遗忘，且数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义失真的输入。

Method: 集成专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；基于标签描述的对比学习；知识蒸馏防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试中持续实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、语义感知路由和对比学习有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 证明了联合多模态引导在视频到音频生成中的有效性，提供了一种无需重新训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

TL;DR: SWAX是一种结合滑动窗口注意力机制和xLSTM线性RNN层的混合架构，研究发现较小的滑动窗口反而能提升长上下文性能，通过随机改变窗口大小训练，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都优于常规窗口注意力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构优于单独的滑动窗口注意力或线性RNN层，但窗口长度的影响以及两种机制的相互作用尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出SWAX混合架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，采用随机改变滑动窗口大小的训练方法。

Result: 反直觉发现：较大的滑动窗口不会改善长上下文性能；短窗口注意力通过减少对注意力机制的依赖，能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆；随机窗口训练在短上下文和长上下文任务上都显著优于常规窗口注意力。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口训练策略，有效平衡了短上下文和长上下文任务的需求，证明了混合架构中窗口大小与线性RNN层相互作用的优化潜力。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验环境中具有良好适应性，能够克服执行器延迟等仪器限制，为主动流动控制提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Method: 使用嵌入算术方法，测量连续环境状态嵌入之间的差异，通过线性和非线性探针测试这些转换向量是否可以从中间模型激活中恢复。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

*Yusuf Guven,Vincenzo Di Vito,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，通过动态预测器和优化代理网络来解决PDE约束优化问题，在保持解质量的同时显著提升计算速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE约束优化在科学和工程领域广泛存在，但决策变量与PDE状态变量紧密耦合，计算需求高，需要处理高维离散化和动态约束

Method: 采用双网络设计：动态预测器（时间离散神经算子）高效近似PDE动力学系统轨迹，优化代理利用代理优化器技术近似最优决策

Result: 在Burgers方程、热方程和电压调节等基准任务上验证，解质量与传统控制算法相当，计算速度提升达四个数量级

Conclusion: 该框架能够实时近似最优策略，同时显式捕捉决策与PDE动力学之间的耦合关系

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

### [232] [Identity Bridge: Enabling Implicit Reasoning via Shared Latent Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24653)
*Pengxiao Lin,Zheng-An Chen,Zhi-Qin John Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Identity Bridge机制，通过在零跳身份任务上监督模型，解决大语言模型在组合推理中的"两跳推理诅咒"问题，并证明该方法能实现分布外两跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是存在"两跳推理诅咒"现象，需要解决这种组合性差距。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化的Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；通过小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果。

Result: 该方法使模型能够成功执行分布外两跳推理任务；理论分析表明身份监督重塑了模型的潜在几何结构；在大规模模型中观察到通过潜在记忆实现两跳推理。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge通过隐式核范数正则化促进低秩解，增强潜在空间对齐，为解决大语言模型的组合推理问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

TL;DR: 提出SAIP方法，通过自适应调整扩散模型中先验与似然项的平衡尺度，无需重新训练即可提升图像恢复任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定的手动调节尺度来平衡先验和似然项，这种静态设计在不同时间步和任务中表现不佳，限制了性能和泛化能力。

Method: SAIP是一个即插即用模块，在每个时间步自适应地优化尺度参数，无需重新训练或修改扩散主干网络，可无缝集成到现有采样器中。

Result: SAIP在多种图像恢复任务中一致提高了重建质量，包括具有挑战性的场景。

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法中固定尺度设计的局限性，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的性能。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: T-POP是一种实时个性化方法，通过在线收集用户偏好反馈来指导冻结LLM的解码过程，无需更新模型参数即可实现快速个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前个性化方法对新用户的冷启动问题，避免资源密集的微调或大量用户数据需求。

Method: 结合测试时对齐和决斗赌博机算法，在线学习用户偏好的奖励函数，智能平衡探索用户偏好和利用已学知识。

Result: 实验表明T-POP实现了快速且数据高效的个性化，显著优于现有基线方法，并随着用户交互增加持续改进。

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM个性化提供了一种有效的新范式，能够实时适应用户偏好而无需模型参数更新。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

TL;DR: CURA是一种受模拟音频信号处理电路启发的紧凑型AI架构，可在资源受限设备上实现跨领域机器学习任务，相比现有方法参数减少2500倍，在回归、分类、NLP和计算机视觉任务中表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有设备端AI架构的两个关键限制：缺乏紧凑性（参数需求随任务复杂度线性增长）和泛化能力差（只能在特定应用领域有效工作）。

Method: 提出CURA架构，灵感来源于模拟音频信号处理电路，提供跨多个领域的紧凑轻量级机器学习解决方案。

Result: 在紧凑性方面，使用比基线模型少2500倍的参数达到同等准确率；在泛化性方面，在四个NLP基准测试和一个计算机视觉数据集上表现一致，F1分数高达90%；在复杂模式识别方面，平均绝对误差降低1.6倍，均方误差降低2.1倍。

Conclusion: CURA架构为资源受限环境提供了紧凑、通用且能识别复杂模式的AI解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

Motivation: 解决LLM提示优化的三大挑战：(1)强大专有LLM的黑盒性质，(2)由于查询成本需要高样本效率，(3)多用户间隐私保护协作的需求。

Method: 基于多臂老虎机框架，提出FedPOB（联邦线性UCB算法）和FedPOB-Pref（基于联邦对决老虎机的偏好反馈算法），通过共享模型参数而非原始数据实现协作。

Result: 大量实验表明FedPOB和FedPOB-Pref显著优于现有基线方法，且随着更多智能体参与协作，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 联邦多臂老虎机框架有效解决了LLM提示优化的关键挑战，实现了样本高效、隐私保护的协作优化。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线在模型评估中的关系，发现决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者在相同阈值下会选择相同的最优模型，但Brier曲线适用范围更广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的分类模型评估方法往往忽视模型使用环境中的决策阈值选择问题，而决策阈值会影响正确分类正负样本的相对价值。需要比较DCA和成本曲线这两种考虑决策阈值的评估方法。

Method: 通过理论分析和比较决策曲线分析(DCA)与成本曲线（特别是Brier曲线）的关系，研究它们在模型评估中的异同点和适用性。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线在假设模型得分已校准且使用相对价值设置分类阈值时密切相关，两者x轴等价。在任何给定阈值下，净收益和Brier损失都会选择相同的最优模型。Brier曲线适用范围更广，其曲线下面积即为Brier分数。

Conclusion: DCA和成本曲线是互补的模型评估方法，Brier曲线在更广泛的阈值范围内适用，建议在DCA中使用上包络决策曲线来显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了对奖励模型失效的理论理解，还提出了改善长尾鲁棒性的实用干预措施。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

Motivation: 大语言模型对齐面临多目标偏好的关键困境：改进一个维度往往以牺牲其他维度为代价，如帮助性和无害性之间的权衡。现有方法主要关注约束优化和数据选择，但忽视了参数层面的冲突解决。

Method: OrthAlign利用正交子空间分解，将参数更新空间分解为正交子空间，确保不同偏好的优化在数学上不干扰的方向进行，并提供理论保证证明参数增量满足正交约束和谱范数界限时更新具有线性Lipschitz增长。

Result: 实验表明：I. 在多目标对齐后，OrthAlign在帮助性、无害性和真实性维度上实现了34.61%到50.89%的最大单偏好改进；II. 平均整体奖励提升13.96%。

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解从根本上解决了多目标偏好对齐中的梯度冲突，实现了稳定收敛和显著的多维度改进。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Motivation: 离散VAE中的离散随机变量无法精确微分参数化，现有方法如Gumbel-Softmax重参数化或REINFORCE在高维任务中效果有限，需要更好的训练方法。

Method: 结合策略搜索技术，使用非参数编码器的自然梯度来更新参数编码器，无需重参数化，并采用自动步长调整和基于transformer的编码器。

Result: 在ImageNet等挑战性数据集上优于近似重参数化方法和基于量化的离散自编码器，在ImageNet 256上FID分数提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展到了高维数据重建任务，为离散VAE提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

Conclusion: Q-Net提供物理可解释的队列长度估计，无需昂贵传感基础设施，其实时变体有潜力集成到动态队列交通控制系统中。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Conclusion: TRIANGLE相似度度量方法显著提升了多模态建模性能，同时产生可解释的对齐原理，为多模态学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但默认的欧几里得几何可能与生物数据固有的层次结构不匹配。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，使学习到的表示与mRNA和氨基酸之间关系定义的生物层次结构对齐。

to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Motivation: 现实世界中的离线数据和在线交互往往存在噪声甚至恶意污染，这会严重降低离线到在线强化学习的性能。现有工作主要关注通过在线探索缓解离线策略的保守性，但在数据污染下的鲁棒性尚未被探索。

Method: 提出RPEX方法，将逆概率加权（IPW）融入在线探索策略，缓解数据污染导致的策略重尾行为。

Result: 在D4RL数据集上的广泛实验表明，RPEX在各种数据污染场景下实现了最先进的离线到在线强化学习性能。

Conclusion: RPEX是一种简单而有效的方法，能够显著提升离线到在线强化学习在数据污染环境中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation
with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task
complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test
settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known
optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its
flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.
By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the
evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool
for developing more robust agents.

*Zixu Wang,Hongbin Dong,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DSAT-HD模型，通过混合分解、多尺度自适应路径和双流残差学习框架，解决了现有时间序列预测方法在捕获跨范围多样特征和处理复杂季节性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法主要建模有限时间序列或固定尺度，难以捕获跨不同范围的多样特征；传统分解方法如STL需要预定义季节周期且通常只能处理单一固定季节性。

Method: 1) 结合EMA和傅里叶分解的混合分解机制，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节和趋势成分；2) 多尺度自适应路径，使用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层，通过稀疏组合器合并特征；3) 双流残差学习框架，CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节和趋势成分，通过平衡损失函数协调。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSAT-HD整体优于现有方法，并在某些数据集上达到最先进性能，同时在各种迁移场景中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解、多尺度自适应和双流学习机制，有效解决了时间序列预测中的复杂季节性和多尺度特征捕获问题，展现出优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

TL;DR: 本文提出用catnat函数替代softmax函数来处理深度学习中的潜在分类变量，通过层次二分法改善梯度下降效率，在多个任务中提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的潜在分类变量广泛存在，但其离散特性给基于梯度的学习算法带来挑战。现有方法主要改进梯度估计技术，本文从信息几何角度重新审视softmax函数的局限性。

Method: 提出catnat函数替代softmax，该函数由一系列层次二分法组成，能够产生对角Fisher信息矩阵，从而为梯度下降提供显著优势。

Result: 在图结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等任务上的实验表明，catnat函数提高了学习效率，并带来更高的测试性能。

Conclusion: Catnat函数易于实现，与现有代码库无缝集成，兼容标准训练稳定技术，是softmax函数的更好替代方案。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)训练LLMs在序列决策中的探索能力，发现这些方法能让LLMs在多臂老虎机任务中达到接近UCB和Thompson采样的性能，并具有良好的泛化能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型有潜力成为自主智能体，但在序列决策中常常探索不足。研究旨在通过SFT和RL方法提升LLMs的探索能力，并理解这些方法如何塑造探索策略及其泛化性能。

Method: 使用SFT在专家轨迹上训练LLMs，以及使用RL配合定制奖励信号（包括策略性后悔形状奖励和算法奖励）进行训练。

Result: 训练后的智能体表现优于预训练模型，性能接近UCB和Thompson采样，在6倍更长的时间跨度和不同老虎机家族中具有鲁棒泛化能力。行为分析显示性能提升主要来自更复杂但更贪婪的利用策略。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了每种训练范式的适用场景，提倡定制奖励设计和超越平均后悔的评估方法，以促进鲁棒的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Conclusion: 通过减少特征相关性，提出的方法能够显著改善迁移学习效果，为深度RL的实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖PPO等策略优化框架，存在训练不稳定、多样性崩溃问题，需要复杂启发式技巧和精细调参。作者发现数学推理中的RLVR具有更简单的MDP结构，可能简化现有复杂方法。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，基于均匀随机策略的Q函数直接恢复最优动作，绕过传统策略迭代循环。通过softmax采样这些Q值来选择动作，保持训练过程中的多样性。

Result: 在多个基础模型和数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1 +8.2，pass@256 +16.8）和多样性（+17.6%）方面均优于现有复杂方法。

Conclusion: ROVER证明了在数学推理任务中，可以大幅简化RL方法，通过均匀随机策略的Q函数直接获得高性能，同时保持更好的多样性，为RLVR提供了更简洁有效的解决方案。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

Conclusion: FIM-PP模型提供了一种无需额外训练或可快速微调的高效MTPP推理方法，展示了基础模型在点过程建模中的潜力。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 损失曲线坍缩是LLM高效训练的重要特征，可作为开发高效LLM的有效工具，如通过Celerity LLM家族的训练验证了这一发现。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有显著优势，CHARM方法有效且具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成模型MSM Emulators，通过马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转移，相比传统分子动力学模拟实现了两个数量级的加速，并在多个蛋白质结构指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子动力学模拟计算成本高昂，现有生成模型学习固定滞后转移密度，训练信号被频繁但无信息的转移主导。

Method: 引入MSM Emulators类生成模型，基于马尔可夫状态模型学习离散状态间的转移采样，具体实现为Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM)。

Result: MarS-FM相比隐式或显式溶剂MD模拟实现了超过两个数量级的加速，在RMSD、回转半径和二级结构含量等结构指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSM Emulators框架和MarS-FM方法在蛋白质轨迹生成方面表现出色，能够有效泛化到未见过的蛋白质序列，为蛋白质功能研究提供了高效的计算工具。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SIREN方法来解决强化学习中验证奖励（RLVR）的熵崩溃和过早收敛问题，通过选择性熵正则化在数学推理任务上取得了显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在大规模推理模型（LRM）中失效，因为庞大的动作空间和长轨迹会导致全局熵爆炸，需要限制探索到有意义的动作和状态子集

Method: SIREN采用两步熵掩码机制：top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码，将正则化转换为自锚定形式以稳定训练

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN在平均性能上优于之前的熵相关RLVR方法，在AIME24/25上使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B实现了+6.6 maj@k的提升

Conclusion: SIREN通过促进更大的响应多样性和维持适当的熵水平，有效缓解了RLVR在LRM中的过早收敛问题

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在合成复杂数据分布的高保真样本方面表现出色，但经常违反物理定律或任务规范产生的硬约束。现有方法如重复投影会扭曲学习分布，而多阶段方法会增加算法复杂性并积累误差。

Method: CCFM方法将随机优化集成到采样过程中，直接在噪声中间样本上操作，理论上等效于在干净样本上定义可行集的投影。

Result: 实验表明CCFM在建模偏微分方程控制的复杂物理系统和分子对接问题上优于当前最先进的约束生成模型，提供更高的可行性和保真度。

Conclusion: CCFM在保证可行性的同时减轻了分布扭曲，提供了一种有效的约束生成模型解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了德国未来Dunkelflaute事件（低风能和太阳能发电期）的频率和持续时间，发现在SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下，这些事件在集合平均中与历史时期相比基本保持不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架对CMIP6集合的气候模拟进行降尺度处理，并与ERA5历史记录数据进行比较，评估德国未来Dunkelflaute事件的发生情况。

Result: 在乐观的低排放（SSP2-4.5）和高排放（SSP5-8.5）情景下，德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间在集合平均中与历史时期相比基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，与Dunkelflaute事件相关的风险预计在本世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

TL;DR: GLASS Flows是一种新的采样范式，通过模拟"流匹配模型中的流匹配模型"来采样马尔可夫转移，结合ODE的效率和SDE的随机演化，消除了推理时奖励对齐算法中的效率瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配和扩散模型的奖励对齐算法在推理时存在效率限制，主要瓶颈是依赖SDE采样方法，这比ODE采样效率低且性能较差。

Method: 提出GLASS Flows采样范式，从预训练模型中提取"内部"流匹配模型来采样马尔可夫转移，无需重新训练，结合ODE效率和SDE随机性。

Result: 在大规模文本到图像模型上，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，与Feynman-Kac Steering结合后提升了文本到图像生成的最先进性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型的推理时缩放提供了一个简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed

information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过有效提取动态特征和丰富时间信息，显著提高了基于模型强化学习的样本效率和性能表现。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支架构，结合谱分支和图像分支来改进PDE动力学学习，解决了现有基于注意力方法中全局耦合弱化的问题，在Navier-Stokes基准测试中显著降低了误差并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要采用多尺度窗口自注意力机制，但由于其局部性，真正的全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐渐传播，这削弱了全局耦合并导致闭环推演中的误差积累和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕获全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支关注局部细节和非平稳结构。首先在低频范围内进行受控轻量级混合，然后通过带权加权融合谱路径和图像路径，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Result: 在相同的训练设置和预算下，与基于注意力的强基线相比，DRIFT-Net实现了更低的误差和更高的吞吐量，参数数量减少约15%。在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低了7%-54%，吞吐量保持高于scOT。

Conclusion: 消融研究和理论分析进一步证明了该设计的稳定性和有效性。DRIFT-Net通过结合全局谱信息和局部图像细节，在保持全局结构和高频细节的同时，显著提高了PDE动力学学习的性能。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

Result: 发现SRV形状空间的Karcher均值和有效维度随模型层数呈非线性变化；PLMs优先编码残基间的即时和局部关系，但对较大上下文长度的编码效果下降；最忠实于结构编码的位置接近但早于模型的最后一层。

Conclusion: 在接近但早于最后一层的层上训练折叠模型可能提高折叠性能，因为该位置的结构编码最忠实。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在抗体贝叶斯优化中融入结构信息的方法，发现某些结构信息在早期优化轮次中能提高稳定性优化的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。当加入蛋白质语言模型的软约束后，序列方法能达到与结构方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗体治疗特性工程通常需要迭代且昂贵的过程，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。但为高度结构化的抗体空间选择最优代理模型很困难，且可能因优化特性而异。此前没有工作尝试将结构信息融入抗体贝叶斯优化。

Method: 探索了将结构信息融入贝叶斯优化的不同方法，并与多种仅使用序列的方法进行比较。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的"软约束"来引导优化到有前景的空间区域。

Result: 发现某些类型的结构信息在稳定性优化的早期轮次中提高了数据效率，但峰值性能相当。当加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力优化的数据效率差距减小，稳定性优化的差距消除，序列方法能与结构方法性能匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果对贝叶斯优化中结构信息的必要性提出了质疑，表明在适当的引导下，仅使用序列的方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出OAT-FM方法，将流匹配与最优加速传输理论结合，通过优化加速度传输而非恒定速度，实现更直的生成路径，并提出两阶段微调范式提升现有模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流匹配方法隐含了路径拉直目标，但缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在将流匹配与最优加速传输理论结合，从加速度角度提供理论解释并改进方法。

Method: 提出OAT-FM方法，在样本和速度的乘积空间中优化加速度传输，对应流直度的充要条件。设计了低复杂度算法实现，并建立两阶段微调范式：先用任意FM方法训练，再用OAT-FM微调。

Result: OAT-FM在多种生成任务中一致提升模型性能，避免了数据分布漂移风险，无需生成大量噪声数据对。

Conclusion: OAT-FM为流匹配提供了新的理论视角，通过优化加速度传输实现更有效的生成建模，提出的两阶段微调范式具有实用价值。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUCHESS是一个LLM服务系统，通过分支编排和难度感知调度，在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著减少推理延迟和token使用量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理算法如思维链和多分支推理虽然提高准确性，但大幅增加token使用和延迟，且现有方法主要关注减少token使用而忽略其他延迟因素

Method: 使用轻量级线性探测模型基于LLM层激活预测分支正确性，编排策略决定终止、复制或继续分支，并采用难度感知调度优先处理简单推理任务

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，相比自一致性方法，在相同准确率下减少42-63%的token使用，在vLLM服务中平均延迟减少57-81%，尾部延迟减少52-84%

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支编排和调度策略，有效解决了LLM推理中的延迟和成本问题，同时保持准确性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠自适应正则化(OAR)方法，通过根据重叠权重比例正则化目标模型，在低重叠区域提高CATE估计性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CATE估计方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要解决这一局限性

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化(OAR)，将正则化与重叠权重成比例，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化；该方法可与任何现有CATE元学习器结合，支持参数和非参数二阶模型

Result: 通过一系列(半)合成实验证明，OAR在低重叠设置下相比恒定正则化显著改善了CATE估计

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习器正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能够有效提升低重叠区域的CATE估计性能

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺性推动了对更高效样本利用的大语言模型的需求，需要比较不同模型的样本效率

Method: 使用双下降现象来整体比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析它们在欠参数化和过参数化阶段的行为

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化阶段，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失二次下降

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上样本效率更高，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算资源时才具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

Motivation: 为PPO算法提供超越有限维假设的坚实理论基础，阐明在RKHS中进行近端更新与核TD评论家何时能实现全局策略改进和实际效率。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中解耦策略评估和改进：(1)使用核化TD评论家进行高效RKHS梯度更新；(2)通过KL正则化的自然梯度策略步长恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。

Result: 提供了非渐近、实例自适应的理论保证，其速率取决于RKHS熵；经验上，理论对齐的调度在控制任务中提高了稳定性和样本效率，TD评论家在吞吐量上优于GAE基线。

Conclusion: 该研究将PPO置于更坚实的理论基础上，阐明了使用核TD评论家的RKHS近端更新在连续状态-动作空间中实现全局策略改进的条件和实际效率。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成员推理攻击已成为紧迫的隐私问题，需要理解这些模型如何泄露训练数据信息，并开发更高效的攻击方法。

Method: 基于理论分析发现去噪器输出指向训练样本的核加权局部均值，其范数编码与训练集的接近程度。提出SimA单查询攻击，利用这一观察替代现有的多查询方法。

Result: SimA在DDPM和潜在扩散模型变体上均表现优异。发现潜在扩散模型由于潜在自编码器的强信息瓶颈而比像素空间模型更不易受攻击。通过调整β-VAE正则化参数可增强LDM训练对MIA的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，同时强调需要更好地理解VAE反演而不仅仅是扩散过程反演，以提升潜在扩散方法的隐私保护能力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Motivation: 野火是严重的自然灾害，深度学习在预测野火危险方面有潜力，但由于缺乏不确定性量化，其可靠性受到质疑。

Method: 使用不确定性感知的深度学习框架，联合建模认知不确定性（模型）和偶然不确定性（数据）。

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，将推理建模为连续高维思维的隐马尔可夫链，替代传统的token级链式思维推理，实现了更高效、更灵活的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、受限于离散token空间形成信息瓶颈、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为隐马尔可夫链，其中内部思维是连续高维状态，显式推理步骤作为可观测变量。采用两阶段变分训练方案来训练这种潜在过程。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS性能达到token级链式思维推理水平，在GSM8K上甚至超越4.7%，推理速度提升高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS为LLM推理提供了新的连续思维范式，不仅性能优异，还支持步骤级随机性控制，为强化学习和推理开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Conclusion: 严格刻画了各阶段的极限动态，证明了在所述极限下的收敛性，并通过仿真验证了理论结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了新的高效调优原则，为缩放定律的未来研究提供了启发。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)方法，这是一种用于扩散模型的策略梯度方法，通过使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失来降低方差，并通过优势函数重新加权样本，实现了预训练和强化学习的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型的强化学习方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，导致方差增加和收敛速度变慢。本文旨在建立预训练和强化学习之间的统一框架。

Method: AWM方法使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失作为目标函数，通过优势函数对每个样本进行重新加权，提升高奖励样本的影响，抑制低奖励样本的影响。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO（基于DDPO）实现了高达24倍的加速，应用于Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium和FLUX模型时，在不影响生成质量的情况下显著提升了收敛速度。

Conclusion: AWM方法在概念和实践上统一了预训练和强化学习，符合策略梯度理论，降低了方差，实现了更快的收敛速度，为扩散模型的强化学习训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的联合似然估计方法，用于回归任务中的分布外检测，通过同时考虑输入和模型预测来提供任务感知的可靠性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动模型在天气预报和流体动力学等关键科学领域应用广泛，但这些方法在分布外数据上容易失败，而回归任务中的失败检测是一个开放挑战。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散模型估计联合似然，同时考虑输入和回归模型的预测，提供任务感知的可靠性评分。

Result: 在多个科学数据集（包括PDE数据集、卫星图像和脑肿瘤分割）上的实验表明，该方法估计的似然与预测误差强相关。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建可验证的'信任证书'奠定了基础，为评估基于AI的科学预测的可信度提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督训练工作流，通过将实验测量的探针与程序生成的合成物体相结合来强调探针学习，使单个物理信息神经网络能够在多个光束线上重建未见过的实验，实现了多探针泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线ptychography是一种数据密集型成像技术，在下一代光源中预计将变得普遍。需要实时反馈和加速采集速率推动了像深度神经网络这样的替代重建模型的发展，但现有深度学习方法缺乏跨不同实验条件的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用无监督训练工作流，结合实验测量的探针和程序生成的合成物体进行探针学习。这种以探针为中心的方法使单个物理信息神经网络能够重建跨多个光束线的未见实验。

Result: 发现探针学习与分布内学习同等重要；使用这种合成工作流训练的模型实现了与仅使用实验数据训练的模型相当的重建保真度，即使改变合成训练物体的类型。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够训练实验引导模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈，实现了多探针泛化，是首批多探针泛化演示之一。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线学习中的回放设置框架，分析了机器学习系统在自标注数据训练时可能陷入错误强化的风险。通过引入扩展阈值维度作为可学习性的精确度量，证明了闭包学习器在该设置下的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自标注数据上训练，它们可能强化错误并成为自身信念的回音室。本文旨在建模这种现象，分析在回放设置下的学习理论问题。

Method: 引入在线学习回放设置框架，定义扩展阈值维度作为可学习性度量。提出基于闭包的学习器，并证明其在对抗性和随机性对手下的性能界限。

Result: 证明了扩展阈值维度是该模型下可学习性的精确度量。闭包学习器最多犯扩展阈值维度次错误，且没有算法能做得更好。对于闭包类，在随机对手下也有类似界限。

Conclusion: 回放设置比经典错误界限设置更难学习。某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的扩展阈值维度。适当学习仅在类几乎闭包时才可行，否则每个适当学习器都会遭受线性错误。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

TL;DR: BALF是一个无需微调的神经网络压缩框架，通过激活感知因子分解和可扩展的预算秩分配器，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络压缩技术通常需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，使其在普通硬件上不实用。受LLM压缩研究的启发，需要开发一种无需微调的通用压缩方法。

Method: 提出激活感知因子分解框架，适用于多种层类型；引入可扩展的预算秩分配器，可灵活控制压缩目标且无额外开销。

Result: 在多个规模和架构上验证有效性，从ResNet-20到ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器。例如，BALF将ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%，仅导致top-1准确率下降1个百分点。

Conclusion: BALF形成了一个无需微调的高效模型压缩流水线，在免微调机制下取得了优异的结果。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制如何选择性地关注信息丰富的token，从而检测稀疏、弱小的特征，特别是当这些特征在长序列中稀疏分布时。

Method: 使用稀疏token分类模型，正样本在随机选择的token子集中嵌入弱信号向量，负样本为纯噪声。分析单层注意力分类器在长序列极限下的理论性能。

Result: 注意力分类器仅需对数级信号强度即可实现消失的测试误差，而线性分类器需要平方根级强度。仅需两次梯度更新即可使查询权重向量与隐藏信号对齐，产生选择性放大信息token的注意力图。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择，在检测稀疏弱信号方面优于非自适应线性基线，解释了其优势的理论基础。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

Method: 使用ENGAGE数据集，通过受控实验评估三种物理信息策略：功率流约束损失函数、复数神经网络和基于残差的任务重构。

Result: 研究提供了关于哪种模型假设能最有效地指导现代配电网中可靠高效电压预测学习的实用见解。

Conclusion: 物理信息策略能显著提高电压预测模型的泛化能力和可靠性，为配电网电压预测提供了有效的学习指导。

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散扩散模型的奖励引导微调提供了可靠框架，通过树搜索和轨迹感知方法克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在重复思维模式，减少这些重复往往以性能下降为代价，需要克服这种权衡

Method: 在训练过程中迭代交替压缩和扩展推理预算，通过动态调整最大展开长度来强制模型在有限上下文中做出精确决策

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时减少46.9%token使用，SIRI-high达到最高准确率

Conclusion: 周期性振荡输出截断长度能在训练中动态平衡探索和效率，收敛到性能与效率之间的最优平衡点

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Motivation: 在多智能体强化学习中，"赢则保持，输则改变"原则被广泛采用，但缺乏对其收敛性的理论保证。论文旨在回答：在什么条件下，从任意初始联合策略都能通过有限步的满意路径到达某个均衡点？

Method: 通过分析满意路径的数学性质，建立了保证有限长度满意路径存在的充分条件。研究了有限状态马尔可夫游戏和N玩家游戏中的策略收敛过程。

Result: 证明了任何有限状态马尔可夫游戏和任何N玩家游戏都保证从任意初始策略到某个均衡点存在有限长度的满意路径。

Conclusion: 这些结果为多智能体强化学习算法的设计提供了更强的理论基础，确保了基于"赢则保持，输则改变"原则的算法在有限步内能够收敛到均衡。

Abstract: In game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), each agent
selects a strategy, interacts with the environment and other agents, and
subsequently updates its strategy based on the received payoff. This process
generates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \geq 0}$, where $s^t$
represents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely
adopted principle in MARL algorithms is "win-stay, lose-shift", which dictates
that an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response.
This principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has
become an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is
referred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and
explored in the context of $N$-player games in [39]. A fundamental question
arises regarding this principle: Under what conditions does every initial joint
strategy $s$ admit a finite-length satisficing path $(s^t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$
where $s^0=s$ and $s^T$ is an equilibrium? This paper establishes a sufficient
condition for such a property, and demonstrates that any finite-state Markov
game, as well as any $N$-player game, guarantees the existence of a
finite-length satisficing path from an arbitrary initial strategy to some
equilibrium. These results provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the
design of MARL algorithms.

Motivation: 纯GTO策略虽然能避免损失但不能保证最大利润，需要开发能超越GTO并剥削对手的模型

Method: 首先通过自我对弈模拟找到接近理论最优的GTO基线策略，然后观察对手行为并实时调整策略进行剥削

Result: 蒙特卡洛反事实遗憾最小化(CFR)在单挑情况下表现最佳，CFR在多数多玩家情况下仍是最强方法

Conclusion: 通过结合GTO的防御能力和实时剥削能力，扑克AI可以从避免损失转向持续战胜多样化对手

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统进化博弈理论假设所有玩家都拥有完整策略空间的全面知识，但现实社会中个体存在知识、经验和背景的异质性。超博弈通过允许个体对完整策略集的访问不同来体现这种异质性，但其进化后果尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用包含合作、背叛和孤独者三种策略的原型模型，这些策略表现出类似石头剪刀布的循环主导关系。研究覆盖了混合良好和空间格点种群，探索进化超博弈动态中策略集的学习和演化。

Result: 与传统进化博弈动态形成鲜明对比，发现了微妙而复杂的相态，包括孤独者主导、多策略集共存、合作与孤独者组合主导等。特别值得注意的是，更高的理性水平显著促进了合作行为。

Conclusion: 进化超博弈动态揭示了比传统模型更丰富的演化结果，认知和信息约束在塑造策略演化中起着关键作用，理性水平的提高有利于合作行为的出现和维持。

Abstract: In the realm of evolutionary game theory, standard frameworks typically
presuppose that every player possesses comprehensive knowledge and unrestricted
access to the entire strategy space. However, real-world human society
inherently harbors diverse levels of knowledge, experience, and background
among individuals. Hypergames incorporate this heterogeneity by permitting
individuals to differ in their access to the full strategy set, reflecting
cognitive or informational constraints and giving rise to asymmetric strategic
interactions. Yet, their evolutionary consequences remain underexplored. Our
inquiry employs prototype models featuring three available strategies, focusing
on social dilemmas involving cooperation, defection, and loner. These
strategies manifest cyclic dominance, akin to the well-studied
rock-paper-scissors dynamics, a foundational model in game theory. Our study
spans both well-mixed and spatial lattice populations, delving into the
intricacies of learning and evolution of the strategy set within the
evolutionary hypergame dynamics. In stark contrast to traditional evolutionary
game dynamics, our findings unveil nuanced and intricate phases, encompassing
scenarios of loner dominance, coexistence of multiple strategy sets,
combinations of cooperation and loner dominance, and more. Remarkably, we
discern that heightened rationality significantly promotes cooperative
behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过期票券的特性导致卖家需要在过期前尽快销售，这会促使降价，而降价又激励买家等待，形成矛盾。需要找到解决这种张力的最优定价策略。

Method: 引入基于价值的阈值（VBT）策略，将买家的二维类型（估值和到达时间）解耦，通过常微分方程证明均衡存在性并提供构造性表征方法。

Result: 针对两种典型市场制定近似最优定价策略：薄市场采用恒定价格，厚市场采用线性折扣。数值前沿分析验证了这些基准策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 厚市场或高时间敏感性的卖家适合线性折扣策略，薄市场适合恒定价格策略。对于耐心的卖家，准拍卖策略（保持高价直到最后大幅降价）在聚集需求方面最有效。

Abstract: We study the optimal dynamic pricing of an expiring ticket or voucher, sold
by a time-sensitive seller to strategic buyers who arrive stochastically with
private values. The expiring nature creates a conflict: the seller's urgency to
sell before expiration drives price reductions, which in turn incentivize
buyers to wait. We seek the seller's optimal pricing policy that resolves this
tension. The main analytical challenge is that buyer type is two-dimensional
(valuation and arrival time), which makes equilibrium intractable under general
strategies. To address this, we introduce the Value-Based Threshold (VBT)
strategy, a tractable framework that decouples these two dimensions. Using this
framework, we prove equilibrium existence via an ordinary differential equation
and provide a constructive procedure for its characterization. We then derive
near-optimal pricing policies for two stylized regimes: a constant price in
thin markets and a linear discount in thick markets. Numerical frontier
analysis confirms these benchmarks and shows how optimal policy adapts as the
seller's time sensitivity changes. Our findings clarify the conflict between
quick sales and strategic waiting. Sellers facing thick markets or high time
sensitivity benefit from linear discounts, while in thin markets a constant
price neutralizes buyers' incentive to wait. We also show this simple policy
remains robust across broad conditions. For patient sellers, a quasi-auction
schedule that maintains a high price until a sharp final drop is most effective
in aggregating demand.

Conclusion: 该算法能够高效搜索解空间，在尊重个体外科医生目标的同时实现外科主任目标的优化，为手术室调度问题提供了有效的均衡解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a multi-agent scheduling problem for organising the
operations within the operating room department. The head of the surgeon group
and individual surgeons are together responsible for the surgeon schedule and
surgical case planning. The surgeon head allocates time blocks to individual
surgeons, whereas individual surgeons determine the planning of surgical cases
independently, which might degrade the schedule quality envisaged by the
surgeon head. The bilevel optimisation under study seeks an optimal Nash
equilibrium solution -- a surgeon schedule and surgical case plan that optimise
the objectives of the surgeon head, while ensuring that no individual surgeon
can improve their own objective within the allocated time blocks. We propose a
dedicated branch-and-price that adds lazy constraints to the formulation of
surgeon-specific pricing problems to ensure an optimal bilevel feasible
solution is retrieved. In this way, the surgeon head respects the objective
requirements of the individual surgeons and the solution space can be searched
efficiently. In the computational experiments, we validate the performance of
the proposed algorithm and its dedicated components and provide insights into
the benefits of attaining an equilibrium solution under different scenarios by
calculating the price of stability and the price of decentralisation.

Result: 理论上期权价值和行权概率随市场波动性、期权窗口长度和外部信号依赖度增加而增长。实证显示平均只有0.82%的区块会行权，但在高波动日可达6%。依赖CEX-DEX套利的构建者更可能行权。

Conclusion: 免费期权问题在高波动时期会显著影响网络活跃性。缩短期权窗口或惩罚行权行为可以有效降低活跃性风险。

Abstract: Ethereum's upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade introduces EIP-7732 enshrined
Proposer--Builder Separation (ePBS), which improves the block production
pipeline by addressing trust and scalability challenges. Yet it also creates a
new liveness risk: builders gain a short-dated ``free'' option to prevent the
execution payload they committed to from becoming canonical, without incurring
an additional penalty. Exercising this option renders an empty block for the
slot in question, thereby degrading network liveness.
  We present the first systematic study of the free option problem. Our
theoretical results predict that option value and exercise probability grow
with market volatility, the length of the option window, and the share of block
value derived from external signals such as external market prices. The
availability of a free option will lead to mispricing and LP losses. The
problem would be exacerbated if Ethereum further scales and attracts more
liquidity. Empirical estimates of values and exercise probabilities on
historical blocks largely confirm our theoretical predictions. While the option
is rarely profitable to exercise on average (0.82\% of blocks assuming an
8-second option time window), it becomes significant in volatile periods,
reaching up to 6\% of blocks on high-volatility days -- precisely when users
most require timely execution.
  Moreover, builders whose block value relies heavily on CEX-DEX arbitrage are
more likely to exercise the option. We demonstrate that mitigation strategies
-- shortening the option window or penalizing exercised options -- effectively
reduce liveness risk.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个结合能量感知任务分配和博弈论收益共享机制的车载云计算管理方案，证明VCC在延迟、盈利性和可持续性方面优于传统边缘计算。


<details>

Motivation: 车载云计算虽然概念吸引人，但缺乏定量证据证明其在现实场景中的盈利性和环境优势，阻碍了其采用。

Method: 提出了结合能量感知任务分配和基于联盟博弈论的收益共享机制的管理框架，联合建模延迟、能耗、货币激励和碳排放。

Result: 模拟显示该方法支持低延迟任务执行，有效货币化车辆资源，相比传统边缘基础设施减少99%以上的CO2排放。

Conclusion: VCC可以成为边缘计算的实际和可持续替代方案，同时实现盈利性和环境友好性。

Abstract: Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) leverages the idle computing capacity of
vehicles to execute end-users' offloaded tasks without requiring new
computation infrastructure. Despite its conceptual appeal, VCC adoption is
hindered by the lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating its profitability
and environmental advantages in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles the
fundamental question: Can VCC be both profitable and sustainable? We address
this problem by proposing a management scheme for VCC that combines
energy-aware task allocation with a game-theoretic revenue-sharing mechanism.
Our framework is the first to jointly model latency, energy consumption,
monetary incentives, and carbon emissions within urban mobility and 5G
communication settings. The task allocation strategy maximizes the aggregate
stakeholder utility while satisfying deadlines and minimizing energy costs. The
payoffs are distributed via a coalitional game theory adapted to dynamic
vehicular environments, to prevent disincentivizing participants with
potentially negative contributions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our
approach supports low-latency task execution, enables effective monetization of
vehicular resources, and reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99% compared to
conventional edge infrastructures, making VCC a practical and sustainable
alternative to edge computing.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了三种经典匹配问题中的流行匹配概念，提出了流行获胜集作为流行匹配的松弛，并计算了不同问题设置下的流行维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于流行匹配通常不存在，需要研究一种自然的松弛概念——流行获胜集，即一组匹配的集合，在与其他任何匹配的成对选举中能获得多数票。

Method: 通过分析三种经典匹配问题（房屋分配问题、婚姻问题、室友问题），在不同设置下（加权/非加权代理、严格/允许平局的偏好排序）计算流行维度。

Result: 房屋分配问题的流行维度恰好为2；婚姻问题和室友问题的流行维度在2到3之间；在非加权代理且严格偏好的特殊情况下，婚姻问题的流行维度为1，室友问题为2。

Conclusion: 流行维度在不同匹配问题中具有不同的值，这为理解流行匹配的可行性提供了理论依据。

Abstract: We study popular matchings in three classical settings: the house allocation
problem, the marriage problem, and the roommates problem. In the popular
matching problem, (a subset of) the vertices in a graph have preference
orderings over their potential matches. A matching is popular if it gets a
plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other matching.
Unfortunately, popular matchings typically do not exist. So we study a natural
relaxation, namely popular winning sets which are a set of matchings that
collectively get a plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other
matching. The $\textit{popular dimension}$ is the minimum cardinality of a
popular winning set, in the worst case over the problem class.
  We prove that the popular dimension is exactly $2$ in the house allocation
problem, even if the voters are weighted and ties are allowed in their
preference lists. For the marriage problem and the roommates problem, we prove
that the popular dimension is between $2$ and $3$, when the agents are weighted
and/or their preferences orderings allow ties. In the special case where the
agents are unweighted and have strict preference orderings, the popular
dimension of the marriage problem is known to be exactly $1$ and we prove the
popular dimension of the roommates problem is exactly $2$.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化方法，用于创建领域特定的评估数据集，并采用基于大语言模型的检索增强生成(RAG)技术，以改进环境科学领域的数据检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统搜索引擎和基于知识库的领域特定搜索系统在理解多意图查询时存在语义理解不足的问题，导致检索结果不完整，特别是在环境与地球科学研究基础设施中。

Method: 开发自动化方法构建领域特定评估数据集，并集成基于大语言模型的检索增强生成(RAG)技术，使用自然语言查询进行高质量数据检索。

Result: 定量和定性分析表明，基于LLM的信息检索系统在处理多意图查询时，相比基于Elasticsearch的系统具有更高的精确度。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的检索增强生成方法能够有效提升环境科学领域数据检索的准确性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Classical search engines using indexing methods in data infrastructures
primarily allow keyword-based queries to retrieve content. While these
indexing-based methods are highly scalable and efficient, due to a lack of an
appropriate evaluation dataset and a limited understanding of semantics, they
often fail to capture the user's intent and generate incomplete responses
during evaluation. This problem also extends to domain-specific search systems
that utilize a Knowledge Base (KB) to access data from various research
infrastructures. Research infrastructures (RIs) from the environmental and
earth science domain, which encompass the study of ecosystems, biodiversity,
oceanography, and climate change, generate, share, and reuse large volumes of
data. While there are attempts to provide a centralized search service using
Elasticsearch as a knowledge base, they also face similar challenges in
understanding queries with multiple intents. To address these challenges, we
proposed an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset to
analyze the capability of a search system. Furthermore, we incorporate the
Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), for high-quality retrieval of environmental domain data using natural
language queries. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis of the evaluation
dataset shows that LLM-based systems for information retrieval return results
with higher precision when understanding queries with multiple intents,
compared to Elasticsearch-based systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦推荐系统中，由于客户端交互数据的稀疏性和高度均匀性，导致全局共识表示质量下降和解耦不足，影响了推荐的个性化效果

Method: 提出自适应共识增强(ACE)策略学习全局和客户端特定嵌入的关系，以及一致性-互补性优化(C2O)策略学习更有效和互补的表示

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集上的实验表明Fed3CR具有优越性能

Conclusion: Fed3CR是一个即插即用的方法，可以与其他联邦推荐方法集成以提高性能

Abstract: Personalized federated recommendation system (FedRec) has gained significant
attention for its ability to preserve privacy in delivering tailored
recommendations. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity challenges among
clients and improve personalization, decoupling item embeddings into the server
and client-specific views has become a promising way. Among them, the global
item embedding table serves as a consensus representation that integrates and
reflects the collective patterns across all clients. However, the inherent
sparsity and high uniformity of interaction data from massive-scale clients
results in degraded consensus and insufficient decoupling, reducing consensus's
utility. To this end, we propose a \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{C}onsistency- and
\textbf{C}omplementarity-aware \textbf{C}onsensus-enhanced
\textbf{R}ecommendation (Fed3CR) method for personalized FedRec. To improve the
efficiency of the utilization of consensus, we propose an \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{E}nhancement (ACE) strategy to learn the
relationship between global and client-specific item embeddings. It enables the
client to adaptively enhance specific information in the consensus,
transforming it into a form that best suits itself. To improve the quality of
decoupling, we propose a \textbf{C}onsistency- and
\textbf{C}omplementarity-aware \textbf{O}ptimization (C2O) strategy, which
helps to learn more effective and complementary representations. Notably, our
proposed Fed3CR is a plug-and-play method, which can be integrated with other
FedRec methods to improve its performance. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets represent the superior performance of Fed3CR.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注算法层面的干预来改善推荐系统公平性，但很少研究推荐生态系统本身的结构性变化。本文旨在探索算法多元化（用户可以选择不同推荐算法）以及用户档案可移植性政策对公平性的影响。

Method: 使用模拟方法研究用户档案可移植性问题，分析不同用户档案处理政策如何与消费者和提供者的公平结果相互作用。

Result: 先前研究表明，利基消费者和（特别是）利基提供者从算法选择中受益。本文通过模拟进一步探索用户档案可移植性政策对公平性的具体影响。

Conclusion: 算法多元化和用户档案可移植性政策是影响推荐系统公平性的重要结构性因素，值得深入研究以改善多方利益相关者的公平结果。

Abstract: Ensuring fair outcomes for multiple stakeholders in recommender systems has
been studied mostly in terms of algorithmic interventions: building new models
with better fairness properties, or using reranking to improve outcomes from an
existing algorithm. What has rarely been studied is structural changes in the
recommendation ecosystem itself. Our work explores the fairness impact of
algorithmic pluralism, the idea that the recommendation algorithm is decoupled
from the platform through which users access content, enabling user choice in
algorithms. Prior work using a simulation approach has shown that niche
consumers and (especially) niche providers benefit from algorithmic choice. In
this paper, we use simulation to explore the question of profile portability,
to understand how different policies regarding the handling of user profiles
interact with fairness outcomes for consumers and providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POI预测模型主要依赖短期交通序列信息，往往忽略了长期和短期偏好数据以及用户行为中的关键时空上下文特征。

Method: 通过时空特征处理、多模态嵌入和自注意力聚合等模块提取长期偏好特征和关键时空上下文特征，使用加权融合方法动态调整长短期特征权重，最后通过注意力匹配计算位置候选概率。

Result: 在多个交通数据集上的实验验证表明，该结合多种类型特征的POI预测模型比现有SOTA模型具有更高的预测准确率。

Conclusion: 融合长期偏好和时空上下文特征能显著提升POI推荐性能，证明了多模态特征嵌入方法的有效性。

Abstract: The next Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is mainly based on sequential
traffic information to predict the user's next boarding point location. This is
a highly regarded and widely applied research task in the field of intelligent
transportation, and there have been many research results to date. Traditional
POI prediction models primarily rely on short-term traffic sequence
information, often neglecting both long-term and short-term preference data, as
well as crucial spatiotemporal context features in user behavior. To address
this issue, this paper introduces user long-term preference information and key
spatiotemporal context information, and proposes a POI recommendation model
based on multimodal spatiotemporal context feature embedding. The model
extracts long-term preference features and key spatiotemporal context features
from traffic data through modules such as spatiotemporal feature processing,
multimodal embedding, and self-attention aggregation. It then uses a weighted
fusion method to dynamically adjust the weights of long-term and short-term
features based on users' historical behavior patterns and the current context.
Finally, the fused features are matched using attention, and the probability of
each location candidate becoming the next location is calculated. This paper
conducts experimental verification on multiple transportation datasets, and the
results show that the POI prediction model combining multiple types of features
has higher prediction accuracy than existing SOTA models and methods.

### [307] [MTRec: Learning to Align with User Preferences via Mental Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22807)
*Mengchen Zhao,Yifan Gao,Yaqing Hou,Xiangyang Li,Pengjie Gu,Zhenhua Dong,Ruiming Tang,Yi Cai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MTRec是一个新颖的顺序推荐框架，通过揭示用户对推荐项目的内部满意度来与真实用户偏好对齐。它引入心理奖励模型来量化用户满意度，并使用分布逆强化学习方法学习该模型，从而指导推荐模型更好地匹配用户真实偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐模型主要使用隐式用户反馈进行训练，因为显式反馈获取成本高。但隐式反馈（如点击）并不总能反映用户真实偏好，例如用户可能因标题吸引而点击新闻，但阅读内容后感到不适。这种错误的隐式信号可能严重误导推荐系统。

Method: 提出MTRec框架，引入心理奖励模型量化用户满意度，采用分布逆强化学习方法学习该模型，然后将学习到的心理奖励模型用于指导推荐模型更好地与用户真实偏好对齐。

Result: 实验表明MTRec显著提升了多种推荐模型的性能。在工业短视频平台上部署MTRec后，观察到平均用户观看时间增加了7%。

Conclusion: MTRec通过心理奖励模型和逆强化学习方法，能够有效解决隐式反馈与用户真实偏好不一致的问题，显著提升推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recommendation models are predominantly trained using implicit user feedback,
since explicit feedback is often costly to obtain. However, implicit feedback,
such as clicks, does not always reflect users' real preferences. For example, a
user might click on a news article because of its attractive headline, but end
up feeling uncomfortable after reading the content. In the absence of explicit
feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender
systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation
framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their
internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental
reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse
reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is
then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real
preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to
a variety of recommendation models. We also deploy MTRec on an industrial short
video platform and observe a 7 percent increase in average user viewing time.

<details>

Motivation: 随着Web 2.0和微服务架构的出现，Web API数量激增，现有推荐方法面临语义模糊、缺乏详细比较和时间效率低三大挑战。

Method: 提出WARBERT分层模型，包含WARBERT(R)用于推荐候选API，WARBERT(M)用于精细化匹配，结合双组件特征融合和注意力比较机制，并加入mashup类别判断辅助任务。

Result: 在ProgrammableWeb数据集上的实验表明，WARBERT优于大多数现有解决方案，相比MTFM模型提升高达11.7%，在准确性和效率上都有显著改进。

Conclusion: WARBERT通过分层设计和多任务学习有效解决了Web API推荐中的关键挑战，为高效准确的API推荐提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the emergence of Web 2.0 and microservices architecture, the number of
Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for
efficient Web API recommendation. Existing solutions typically fall into two
categories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for
classification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through
API retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic
ambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed
comparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type
methods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To
address these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model
for Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and
attention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and
mashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for
Recommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as
an initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines
the matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and
mashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is
determined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M).
Additionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category
judgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental
results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms
most existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to
the model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements
in accuracy and effiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统依赖纯自回归训练，仅关注预测下一个项目而忽略用户交互历史的丰富内部结构，无法理解用户潜在意图。

Method: MHL框架在标准自回归目标基础上增加重建掩码历史项目的辅助任务，包含熵引导掩码策略和课程学习调度器。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的生成模型。

Conclusion: 全面理解过去对于准确预测用户未来路径至关重要，历史理解是生成式推荐的关键。

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has
emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its
potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive
training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while
ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus
failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose
Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the
objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history.
MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of
reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand
``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just
``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this
framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the
most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum
learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction
to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that
a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting
a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

Method: 对15部为马德里和里斯本宫廷创作的歌剧进行统计分析，与2404首咏叹调的大型语料库进行对比，考察调性、节拍、速度和声乐处理等方面的差异。

Result: 发现伊比利亚宫廷歌剧在调性、节拍、速度和声乐处理上有独特特征，这些特征反映了当地音乐习俗、性别刻板印象和作曲家个人风格的影响。

Conclusion: 18世纪伊比利亚音乐生产和消费虽然参与国际歌剧潮流，但其独特音乐特征也受到本地音乐传统、社会期望和个人因素的影响，体现了国际化和本地化的双重特性。

Abstract: The exceptional reception of Pietro Metastasio's works during the eighteenth
century, all over Europe and in the Iberian Peninsula in particular, is well
documented. Due to that unparalleled success, it is possible to ascertain Spain
and Portugal's participation in international, contemporary tastes and artistic
webs, applicable to both composers and performers. However, this
internationalisation needs to be nuanced, as some characteristics of the
repertoire specifically written for the Peninsula indicate that their court
audiences may have had expectations, both social and strictly musical,
different from those of the public in opera theatres elsewhere in the
continent. In this light, this article investigates in what ways the style of
five composers in the international scene - Perez, Galuppi, Jommelli, Conforto,
and Corselli - varied when commissioned to write opera seria for the Iberian
courts. The statistical analysis of fifteen settings especially written for the
court theatres in Madrid and Lisbon, in comparison to the average data
extracted from a corpus of 2,404 arias from 126 versions of a select number of
Metastasian librettos, allows us to evaluate some particular usages regarding
key, metre, tempo, and treatment of the vocal part. In this manner, through
quantitative analysis, this article places eighteenth-century Iberian music
production and consumption in the context of European opera seria, while
ultimately suggesting that its unique musical characteristics were also partly
dependent on local musical customs, gender stereotypes, and personal
idiosyncrasies alike.

Conclusion: 本研究为材料科学过程表示提供了设计模式提取方法，促进了本体的模块化和重用，相关资源已开源共享。

Abstract: The representation of workflows and processes is essential in materials
science engineering, where experimental and computational reproducibility
depend on structured and semantically coherent process models. Although
numerous ontologies have been developed for process modeling, they are often
complex and challenging to reuse. Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) offer modular
and reusable modeling solutions to recurring problems; however, these patterns
are frequently neither explicitly published nor documented in a manner
accessible to domain experts. This study surveys ontologies relevant to
scientific workflows and engineering process modeling and identifies implicit
design patterns embedded within their structures. We evaluate the capacity of
these ontologies to fulfill key requirements for process representation in
materials science. Furthermore, we propose a baseline method for the automatic
extraction of design patterns from existing ontologies and assess the approach
against curated ground truth patterns. All resources associated with this work,
including the extracted patterns and the extraction workflow, are made openly
available in a public GitHub repository.

Motivation: 当前电商平台产品信息主要依赖人工分类和属性标注，无法充分覆盖长尾产品，且与买家偏好不匹配，影响平台效率。

Method: GSID包含两个关键组件：1) 在非结构化产品元数据上进行预训练学习领域内语义嵌入；2) 生成针对下游产品中心化应用的更有效语义编码。

Result: 大量实验验证了GSID的有效性，已在真实电商平台成功部署，在产品理解和其他下游任务上取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: GSID提供了一种数据驱动的方法来生成产品结构化表示，能够更好地处理长尾产品和匹配买家偏好。

Abstract: Structured representation of product information is a major bottleneck for
the efficiency of e-commerce platforms, especially in second-hand ecommerce
platforms. Currently, most product information are organized based on manually
curated product categories and attributes, which often fail to adequately cover
long-tail products and do not align well with buyer preference. To address
these problems, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{S}emantic
\textbf{I}n\textbf{D}exings (GSID), a data-driven approach to generate product
structured representations. GSID consists of two key components: (1)
Pre-training on unstructured product metadata to learn in-domain semantic
embeddings, and (2) Generating more effective semantic codes tailored for
downstream product-centric applications. Extensive experiments are conducted to
validate the effectiveness of GSID, and it has been successfully deployed on
the real-world e-commerce platform, achieving promising results on product
understanding and other downstream tasks.

Motivation: 预训练语言模型不同层通常包含不同类型的语言知识，在微调过程中表现不同，而传统密集检索模型仅使用最后一层隐藏层的向量表示文档，未能充分利用多层信息。

Method: 研究不同层表示对MLR性能的影响，提出使用池化策略将多向量模型简化为单向量模型以提高检索效率。

Result: 实验证明MLR在单向量检索设置下优于双编码器、ME-BERT和ColBERT，且能与检索导向预训练和困难负样本挖掘等先进训练技术良好配合。

Conclusion: 多层表示方法能有效提升密集检索性能，通过利用编码器多个层的表示信息，在保持检索效率的同时获得更好的检索效果。

Abstract: Dense retrieval models usually adopt vectors from the last hidden layer of
the document encoder to represent a document, which is in contrast to the fact
that representations in different layers of a pre-trained language model
usually contain different kinds of linguistic knowledge, and behave differently
during fine-tuning. Therefore, we propose to investigate utilizing
representations from multiple encoder layers to make up the representation of a
document, which we denote Multi-layer Representations (MLR). We first
investigate how representations in different layers affect MLR's performance
under the multi-vector retrieval setting, and then propose to leverage pooling
strategies to reduce multi-vector models to single-vector ones to improve
retrieval efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MLR over
dual encoder, ME-BERT and ColBERT in the single-vector retrieval setting, as
well as demonstrate that it works well with other advanced training techniques

TL;DR: MVP-RAG是一个用于产品属性值识别的检索增强生成框架，通过多级检索和生成方法解决现有方法的级联错误、OOD问题和泛化能力不足等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有产品属性值识别方法存在级联错误、无法处理分布外属性值、缺乏泛化能力等关键挑战。

Method: 将PAVI定义为检索生成任务，采用多级检索方案（产品和属性值作为不同层次），结合检索、生成和分类范式，使用产品标题作为查询，检索相似产品和候选属性值，然后生成标准化属性值。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，MVP-RAG在真实工业环境中成功部署，性能优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MVP-RAG通过结合检索、生成和分类的优势，有效解决了PAVI任务中的关键挑战，特别是在处理OOD问题和泛化能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying attribute values from product profiles is a key task for
improving product search, recommendation, and business analytics on e-commerce
platforms, which we called Product Attribute Value Identification (PAVI) .
However, existing PAVI methods face critical challenges, such as cascading
errors, inability to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) attribute values, and
lack of generalization capability. To address these limitations, we introduce
Multi-Value-Product Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MVP-RAG), combining the
strengths of retrieval, generation, and classification paradigms. MVP-RAG
defines PAVI as a retrieval-generation task, where the product title
description serves as the query, and products and attribute values act as the
corpus. It first retrieves similar products of the same category and candidate
attribute values, and then generates the standardized attribute values. The key
advantages of this work are: (1) the proposal of a multi-level retrieval
scheme, with products and attribute values as distinct hierarchical levels in
PAVI domain (2) attribute value generation of large language model to
significantly alleviate the OOD problem and (3) its successful deployment in a
real-world industrial environment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that MVP-RAG performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了Multi-Item-Query注意力机制（MIQ-Attn），通过从用户交互中构建多个不同的查询向量来增强序列推荐系统的稳定性和准确性，有效缓解噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户交互数据固有的不稳定性和噪声挑战序列推荐系统。现有的掩码注意力模型依赖单一最近项目的查询，对这些噪声敏感，降低了预测可靠性。

Method: 设计MIQ-Attn机制，从用户交互中构建多个不同的查询向量，作为现有单查询注意力的即插即用替代方案。

Result: 实验表明MIQ-Attn在基准数据集上显著提高了性能表现。

Conclusion: MIQ-Attn通过多查询机制有效提升了序列推荐系统的稳定性和准确性，能够轻松集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: The inherent instability and noise in user interaction data challenge
sequential recommendation systems. Prevailing masked attention models, relying
on a single query from the most recent item, are sensitive to this noise,
reducing prediction reliability. We propose the Multi-Item-Query attention
mechanism (MIQ-Attn) to enhance model stability and accuracy. MIQ-Attn
constructs multiple diverse query vectors from user interactions, effectively
mitigating noise and improving consistency. It is designed for easy adoption as
a drop-in replacement for existing single-query attention. Experiments show
MIQ-Attn significantly improves performance on benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: UniDex是一种基于模型的倒排索引方法，使用统一语义建模替代传统基于术语的索引，通过UniTouch生成语义ID和UniRank进行语义匹配排序，显著提升检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统倒排索引依赖精确术语匹配，强调表层词汇重叠，限制了系统的泛化能力和检索效果。

Method: 提出UniDex方法，包含两个关键组件：UniTouch将查询和文档映射为语义ID，UniRank使用语义匹配对结果进行排序。

Result: 在大规模工业数据集和真实在线流量评估中，UniDex显著提升了检索能力，在快手短视频搜索系统中成功部署，为数亿活跃用户提供服务。

Conclusion: UniDex实现了从基于术语到基于模型的索引范式转变，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Inverted indexing has traditionally been a cornerstone of modern search
systems, leveraging exact term matches to determine relevance between queries
and documents. However, this term-based approach often emphasizes surface-level
token overlap, limiting the system's generalization capabilities and retrieval
effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose UniDex, a novel
model-based method that employs unified semantic modeling to revolutionize
inverted indexing. UniDex replaces complex manual designs with a streamlined
architecture, enhancing semantic generalization while reducing maintenance
overhead. Our approach involves two key components: UniTouch, which maps
queries and documents into semantic IDs for improved retrieval, and UniRank,
which employs semantic matching to rank results effectively. Through
large-scale industrial datasets and real-world online traffic assessments, we
demonstrate that UniDex significantly improves retrieval capabilities, marking
a paradigm shift from term-based to model-based indexing. Our deployment within
Kuaishou's short-video search systems further validates UniDex's practical
effectiveness, serving hundreds of millions of active users efficiently.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出Retro*方法，通过基于评分标准的关联性评分机制和强化学习优化，在推理密集型文档检索任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理和RAG的流行，需要检索与任务间接或隐式相关的文档，现有IR技术在细粒度推理方面存在挑战，适用性、可扩展性和效率不足。

Method: 引入基于评分标准的关联性评分机制，通过明确标准推理任务与文档关系；支持测试时扩展，通过分数集成组合多个推理轨迹；使用专门设计的强化学习算法优化推理能力。

Result: 在BRIGHT基准测试中优于现有文档检索方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Retro*通过细粒度推理和强化学习优化，有效解决了推理密集型文档检索的挑战，在适用性、可扩展性和效率方面具有优势。

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly
important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even
when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this
problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance
between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a
significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in
reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a
novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method
introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to
reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly
defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance
score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning
trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance
estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism,
which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each
training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document
retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art
performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出了XGC-AVis多智能体框架，通过感知、规划、执行和反思四个阶段增强多模态大模型的音视频时序对齐能力，并引入首个综合评估MLLMs理解能力的基准XGC-AVQuiz。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在音视频时序对齐和质量感知方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的框架和评估基准来提升这些能力。

Method: 采用四阶段多智能体框架：感知、规划、执行、反思；构建包含2,685个问答对的XGC-AVQuiz基准，涵盖PGC、UGC和AIGC三种视频类型，引入质量感知维度。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在质量感知和时序对齐任务上表现不佳，XGC-AVis无需额外训练即可提升这些能力。

Conclusion: XGC-AVis框架有效提升了MLLMs的音视频时序对齐能力，XGC-AVQuiz为评估MLLMs在真实和AI生成场景下的理解能力提供了全面基准。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose XGC-AVis, a multi-agent framework that enhances the
audio-video temporal alignment capabilities of multimodal large models (MLLMs)
and improves the efficiency of retrieving key video segments through 4 stages:
perception, planning, execution, and reflection. We further introduce
XGC-AVQuiz, the first benchmark aimed at comprehensively assessing MLLMs'
understanding capabilities in both real-world and AI-generated scenarios.
XGC-AVQuiz consists of 2,685 question-answer pairs across 20 tasks, with two
key innovations: 1) AIGC Scenario Expansion: The benchmark includes 2,232
videos, comprising 1,102 professionally generated content (PGC), 753
user-generated content (UGC), and 377 AI-generated content (AIGC). These videos
cover 10 major domains and 53 fine-grained categories. 2) Quality Perception
Dimension: Beyond conventional tasks such as recognition, localization, and
reasoning, we introduce a novel quality perception dimension. This requires
MLLMs to integrate low-level sensory capabilities with high-level semantic
understanding to assess audio-visual quality, synchronization, and coherence.
Experimental results on XGC-AVQuiz demonstrate that current MLLMs struggle with
quality perception and temporal alignment tasks. XGC-AVis improves these
capabilities without requiring additional training, as validated on two
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拟声词是漫画文本交流的重要元素，具有视觉风格化的特点（形状、大小、位置变化反映场景强度和情绪），但在漫画生成中未得到足够重视

Method: 提出OnomatoGen方法，专注于拟声词生成，将普通文本风格化为拟声词样式

Result: 实证研究表明拟声词生成具有独特属性，与典型文本风格化方法不同，OnomatoGen能有效将普通文本风格化为拟声词样式

Conclusion: 拟声词生成是漫画生成中的重要研究方向，OnomatoGen方法能有效解决该问题

Abstract: Onomatopoeia is an important element for textual messaging in manga. Unlike
character dialogue in manga, onomatopoeic expressions are visually stylized,
with variations in shape, size, and placement that reflect the scene's
intensity and mood. Despite its important role, onomatopoeia has not received
much attention in manga generation. In this paper, we focus on onomatopoeia
generation and propose OnomatoGen, which stylizes plain text to an onomatopoeic
style. We empirically show the unique properties of onomatopoeia generation,
which differ from typical text stylization methods, and that OnomatoGen can
effectively stylize plain text in an onomatopoeia style.

Motivation: 研究编码分布式存储系统的服务率区域，即容量约束下可实现的数访问请求集合，以理解系统汉明码的性能极限。

Method: 使用超图理论分析系统汉明码的服务率区域，推导系统节点子集索引的数据符号服务率之和的上界，并探索这些界限的可实现性。

Result: 建立了系统二进制汉明码中系统节点子集索引的数据符号服务率之和的上界；对于非系统二进制汉明码，发现聚合服务率受限于关联生成矩阵中奇数列的数量。

Conclusion: 系统汉明码的服务率区域可以通过超图理论有效分析，并确定了系统和非系统二进制汉明码服务率的关键限制因素。

Abstract: The service rate region of a coded distributed storage system is the set of
all achievable data access requests under the capacity constraints. This paper
investigates the service rate regions of systematic Hamming codes using
hypergraph theory and derives bounds for the maximal achievable service rate of
individual data objects. We establish upper bounds on the sum of service rates
of data symbols indexed by a subset of systematic nodes in a systematic binary
Hamming code, and explore the achievability of these bounds. Additionally, for
non-systematic binary Hamming codes, we conclude that the aggregate service
rate is limited by the number of columns of odd weight in the associated
generator matrix.

Motivation: 扩展有限状态维度的概念，研究多个有限状态代理协作时的计算能力，探索不同头数对序列维度计算能力的影响。

Method: 使用h头有限状态赌徒模型，每个头按照单向移动规则报告符号，领导者基于这些信息对后续符号下注，通过赌注策略（gales）量化资本增长速率。

Result: 证明了随着头数h增加存在严格层次结构，给出了明确序列族分离h头和h+1头有限状态赌徒的收益能力；多头有限状态维度在有限并集下稳定，但固定头数h>1的预维度缺乏稳定性。

Conclusion: 多代理协作显著增强了有限状态机器的序列分析能力，头数增加带来严格的计算能力提升，但预维度在有限并集下不稳定的特性揭示了其结构限制。

Abstract: We introduce multihead finite-state dimension, a generalization of
finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with
oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time,
enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In
aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose
maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using
betting strategies called gales, determines the multihead finite-state
dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state
dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main
theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving
an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the
earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head
finite-state gamblers. We prove that multihead finite-state dimension is stable
under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number
$h>1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability
property.

TL;DR: 本文重新研究了zigzag阵列码，为其添加了小域大小和低跳过成本两个新特性，使该MDS码在理论和实践上更具实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: zigzag码虽然具有最优访问和单节点修复重建比，但在实际应用中受到域大小依赖和跳过成本的限制。本文旨在解决这些问题，使zigzag码更适合现代分布式存储系统。

Method: 1) 当行索引群为Z_2^m且域特征为2时，证明任意域大小≥N的显式系数可保证MDS性质；2) 引入排序-子群框架，产生具有有界跳过成本和低修复碎片比的修复传输方案。

Result: 构建了零跳过成本且码率趋近2/3的码族，以及有界跳过成本且码率分别趋近3/4和4/5的码族。这些码率与实践中广泛部署的MDS阵列码相当。

Conclusion: zigzag码可以通过小域大小和低跳过成本的特性，在保持最优访问和重建比的同时，在理论和实践中都变得更加灵活实用。

Abstract: We revisit zigzag array codes, a family of MDS codes known for achieving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio in single-node repair. In this
work, we endow zigzag codes with two new properties: small field size and low
skip cost. First, we prove that when the row-indexing group is $\mathcal{G} =
\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ and the field has characteristic two, explicit coefficients
over any field with $|\mathcal{F}|\ge N$ guarantee the MDS property, thereby
decoupling the dependence among $p$, $k$, and $M$. Second, we introduce an
ordering-and-subgroup framework that yields repair-by-transfer schemes with
bounded skip cost and low repair-fragmentation ratio (RFR), while preserving
optimal access and optimal rebuilding ratio. Our explicit constructions include
families with zero skip cost whose rates approach $2/3$, and families with
bounded skip cost whose rates approach $3/4$ and $4/5$. These rates are
comparable to those of MDS array codes widely deployed in practice. Together,
these results demonstrate that zigzag codes can be made both more flexible in
theory and more practical for modern distributed storage systems.

Motivation: 在仅有单个基站的SISO系统中，仅依靠单个RIS或多个快照都无法实现3D位置和速度联合估计，需要结合两者来解决这一挑战。

Method: 开发了两阶段方法：首先通过张量分解将3D联合离角-多普勒估计分解为两个可处理子问题，采用交替优化；然后基于信道参数估计，通过差分测量和迭代优化实现3D位置和速度联合估计。

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective
anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS)
anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity
estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one
BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when
relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this,
we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable
realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel
parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed
by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a
third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint
angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable
subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating
optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further
design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation
is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the
preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements.
Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that
the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results
confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate
substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to
passive RIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XL-MIMO系统中近场用户和远场用户的通信问题，特别是远场用户因遮挡需要通过RIS进行通信，并寻求降低预编码计算复杂度的方案。

Method: 采用三种预编码方案（CZF、LZF、MRT），提出启发式可见区域选择算法降低复杂度，设计两阶段相位控制和功率分配算法来最大化加权最小频谱效率和。

Result: 当NFUEs和FFUEs优先级相同时，相比等功率分配和随机相位设计，CZF、LZF和MRT分别提升了31.9%、37.8%和119.2%的加权最小频谱效率和。CZF性能最佳，LZF复杂度较低但性能相当。

Conclusion: CZF在平衡性能方面表现最佳，LZF在复杂度与性能间取得良好平衡，特别在优先考虑某一用户组时表现突出。所提算法能有效提升系统性能。

Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted extremely
large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) downlink system, where an
XL-MIMO array serves two groups of single-antennas users, namely near-field
users (NFUEs) and far-field users (FFUEs). FFUEs are subject to blockage, and
their communication is facilitated through the RIS. We consider three precoding
schemes at the XL-MIMO array, namely central zero-forcing (CZF), local
zero-forcing (LZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT). Closed-form
expressions for the spectral efficiency (SE) of all users are derived for MRT
precoding, while statistical-form expressions are obtained for CZF and LZF
processing. A heuristic visibility region (VR) selection algorithm is also
introduced to help reduce the computational complexity of the precoding scheme.
Furthermore, we devise a two-stage phase shifts design and power control
algorithm to maximize the sum of weighted minimum SE of two groups of users
with CZF, LZF and MRT precoding schemes. The simulation results indicate that,
when equal priority is given to NFUEs and FFUEs, the proposed design improves
the sum of the weighted minimum SE by 31.9\%, 37.8\%, and 119.2\% with CZF,
LZF, and MRT, respectively, compared to the case with equal power allocation
and random phase shifts design. CZF achieves the best performance, while LZF
offers comparable results with lower complexity. When prioritizing NFUEs or
FFUEs, LZF achieves strong performance for the prioritized group, whereas CZF
ensures balanced performance between NFUEs and FFUEs.

Conclusion: 在双队列系统中引入传输冻结策略能有效优化信息年龄性能，冻结增益受服务时间分布和服务器异构性的影响。

Abstract: Status update systems require the timely collection of sensing information
for which deploying multiple sensors/servers to obtain diversity gains is
considered as a promising solution. In this work, we construct an absorbing
Markov chain (AMC) to exactly model Age of Information (AoI) in a discretetime
dual-queue (DTDQ) status update system with generate at will (GAW) status
updates, discrete phase-type (DPH-type) distributed service times and
transmission freezing. Specifically, transmission is frozen for a certain
number of slots following the initiation of a transmission, after which one of
the two servers is allowed to simultaneously sample the monitored physical
process and transmit a status update packet, according to the availabilities
and priorities of the two servers. Based on the discrete-time AMC, we provide
the exact distributions of both AoI and peak AoI (PAoI), enabling the
derivation of arbitrary order moments. In addition, we analytically study the
role of freezing using several typical service time distributions, including
geometric, uniform, and triangular distributions. The introduction of freezing
for DTDQ systems is demonstrated to be significantly beneficial in reducing the
mean AoI for various service time distributions. Additionally, we study the
impact of the statistical parameters of the service times and heterogeneity
between the two servers on the freezing gain, i.e., reduction in mean AoI
attained with optimum freezing policies.

Conclusion: 这种新的ND-NOMA设计使得三个用户能够使用不同维度同时通信，为噪声域系统和物联网环境中的可扩展多用户通信铺平了道路。

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel three-user noise-domain non-orthogonal
multiple access (ND-NOMA) scheme by introducing the correlation as a new
dimension besides mean and variance quantities used in two-user ND-NOMA. The
new three-user ND-NOMA scheme includes both uplink and downlink scenarios, with
detectors designed to decode the information embedded in mean, variance, and
correlation. Our theoretical analysis and simulation results under Rician
fading channels show that the proposed system is capable of achieving promising
bit error rate (BER) performance while preserving the low power and low
complexity advantages of ND-NOMA. This new ND-NOMA design enables simultaneous
communication among three users using different dimensions, paving the way for
scalable multi-user communication in noise-domain systems and in the
Internet-of-things (IoT) environments.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of distributed computation of linearly
separable functions, where a master node with access to $K$ datasets, employs
$N$ servers to compute $L$ user-requested functions, each defined over the
datasets. Servers are instructed to compute subfunctions of the datasets and
must communicate computed outputs to the user, who reconstructs the requested
outputs. The central challenge is to reduce the per-server computational load
and the communication cost from servers to the user, while ensuring recovery
for any possible set of $L$ demanded functions.
  We here establish the fundamental communication-computation tradeoffs for
arbitrary $K$ and $L$, through novel task-assignment and communication
strategies that, under the linear-encoding and no-subpacketization assumptions,
are proven to be either exactly optimal or within a factor of three from the
optimum. In contrast to prior approaches that relied on fixed assignments of
tasks -- either disjoint or cyclic assignments -- our key innovation is a
nullspace-based design that jointly governs task assignment and server
transmissions, ensuring exact decodability for all demands, and attaining
optimality over all assignment and delivery methods. To prove this optimality,
we here uncover a duality between nullspaces and sparse matrix factorizations,
enabling us to recast the distributed computing problem as an equivalent
factorization task and derive a sharp information-theoretic converse bound.
Building on this, we establish an additional converse that, for the first time,
links the communication cost to the covering number from the theory of general
covering designs.

Abstract: This paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission
scheme to maximize the minimum achievable rate among ground users for emergency
communications in post-disaster scenarios with obstacles, with which the
optimal positioning of multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled base
stations can be achieved timely.To address the resulting non-convex and
intractable optimization problem, we design an alternating optimization
approach. Specifically, we relax obstacle-related constraints using penalty
terms. In each iteration, block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex
approximation (SCA) are applied alternately to obtain locally optimal
solutions, and penalty multipliers are updated to ensure convergence of the
relaxed problem to the original one. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms benchmark methods in terms of the
minimum achievable rate, verifying its effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: 该研究为DNA存储系统中的可靠数据恢复提供了理论支撑和实用编码方案，解决了噪声插入信道带来的挑战。

Abstract: DNA storage has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale and long-term
data preservation. Among various error types, insertions are the most frequent
errors occurring in DNA sequences, where the inserted symbol is often identical
or complementary to the original, and in practical implementations, noise can
further cause the inserted symbol to mutate into a random one, which creates
significant challenges to reliable data recovery. In this paper, we investigate
a new noisy insertion channel, where infinitely many insertions of symbols
complement or identical to the original ones and up to one insertion of random
symbol may occur. We determine the coding capacity of the noisy channel and
construct asymptotically optimal error-correcting codes achieving the coding
capacity.

Abstract: Massive connectivity with ultra-low latency and high reliability necessitates
fundamental advances in future communication networks operating under
finite-blocklength (FBL) transmission. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) have emerged
as a promising enabler, offering superior spectrum and energy efficiency in
short-packet/FBL scenarios. In this work, by leveraging the simplicity and
accuracy of block-correlation channel modeling, we rigorously bound the
performance limits of FBL-FAS from a statistical perspective, focusing on two
key performance metrics: block error rate (BLER) and outage probability (OP).
Furthermore, we introduce a novel complex-integral simplification method based
on Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, which achieves higher approximation accuracy
compared to existing Taylor-expansion-based approaches. Numerical results
validate the robustness of the proposed analysis and clearly demonstrate the
superiority of FBL-FAS over conventional multiple-antenna systems with fixed
antenna placement.

Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the
development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The
changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical
Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented
paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting,
in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors,
communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two
classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics,
suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time
control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to
semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay
compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide
per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over
error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we
introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced
errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure
distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the
approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting
distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered
compression methods.

Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to
enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to
achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible
mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization
more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To
address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for
stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on
this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base
station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs'
positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to
collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this
problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that
the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of
optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed
problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden
monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To
solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization
framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive
the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer
layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA
positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we
proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional
mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both
conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks

Conclusion: 提出的分裂交替算法是求解拼接正交矩阵线性系统稀疏解的有效方法，具有全局收敛性和高效的计算性能。

Abstract: A class of splitting alternating algorithms is proposed for finding the
sparse solution of linear systems with concatenated orthogonal matrices.
Depending on the number of matrices concatenated, the proposed algorithms are
classified into the two-block splitting alternating algorithm (TSAA) and the
multi-block splitting alternating algorithm (MSAA). These algorithms aim to
decompose a large-scale linear system into two or more coupled subsystems, each
significantly smaller than the original system, and then combine the solutions
of these subsystems to produce the sparse solution of the original system. The
proposed algorithms only involve matrix-vector products and reduced orthogonal
projections. It turns out that the proposed algorithms are globally convergent
to the sparse solution of a linear system if the matrix (along with the
sparsity level of the solution) satisfies a coherence-type condition. Numerical
experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms are very promising and can
quickly and accurately locate the sparse solution of a linear system with
significantly fewer iterations than several mainstream iterative methods.

Motivation: 低秩相位恢复旨在从噪声污染的幅度测量中重建低秩矩阵，该问题结合了相位恢复和低秩矩阵恢复的挑战，在成像、信号处理等领域有重要应用。

Method: 提出了秩约束非线性最小二乘模型和核范数约束的Lasso模型，利用高斯测量集合并建立了强限制等距性质(SRIP)的理论框架。

Result: 证明了重构误差满足$\min\{\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{X}_0\|_F, \|\hat{\mathbf{X}}+\mathbf{X}_0\|_F\}\lesssim \frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$，且该误差界在常数因子内是紧的，所需测量数$p\gtrsim (m+n)r$。

Conclusion: 该工作为相位恢复和低秩矩阵恢复提供了统一的理论框架，扩展了现有结果，并为噪声环境下的低秩相位恢复问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on low-rank phase retrieval, which aims to
reconstruct a matrix $\mathbf{X}_0\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ with ${\mathrm{
rank}}(\mathbf{X}_0)\le r$ from noise-corrupted amplitude measurements
$\mathbf{y}=|\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X}_0)|+\boldsymbol{\eta}$, where
$\mathcal{A}:\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{p}$ is a linear map
and $\boldsymbol{\eta}\in \mathbb{R}^p$ is the noise vector. We first examine
the rank-constrained nonlinear least-squares model $\hat{\mathbf{X}}\in
\mathop{\mathrm{argmin}}\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times
m},\mathrm{rank}(\mathbf{X})\le
r}}\||\mathcal{A}(\mathbf{X})|-\mathbf{y}\|_2^2$ to estimate $\mathbf{X}_0$,
and demonstrate that the reconstruction error satisfies
$\min\{\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}-\mathbf{X}_0\|_F,
\|\hat{\mathbf{X}}+\mathbf{X}_0\|_F\}\lesssim
\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ with high probability, provided
$\mathcal{A}$ is a Gaussian measurement ensemble and $p\gtrsim (m+n)r$. We also
prove that the error bound $\frac{\|\boldsymbol{\eta}\|_2}{\sqrt{p}}$ is tight
up to a constant. Furthermore, we relax the rank constraint to a nuclear-norm
constraint. Hence, we propose the Lasso model for low-rank phase retrieval,
i.e., the constrained nuclear-norm model and the unconstrained version. We also
establish comparable theoretical guarantees for these models. To achieve this,
we introduce a strong restricted isometry property (SRIP) for the linear map
$\mathcal{A}$, analogous to the strong RIP in phase retrieval. This work
provides a unified treatment that extends existing results in both phase
retrieval and low-rank matrix recovery from rank-one measurements.

Conclusion: FRIS通过动态元件选择机制，在空间相关性环境中提供了比传统RIS更优越的保密性能增强能力。

Abstract: This letter investigates the secrecy performance of wireless communication
systems assisted by a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS). Unlike
conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed geometries,
FRISs dynamically select a subset of reflective elements based on real-time
channel conditions, offering enhanced spatial diversity and adaptability. Using
this foundation, we model a secure downlink scenario where a base station
communicates with a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper, and the
propagation is assisted by a FRIS with a limited number of elements set to the
ON state. We analyze the system's secrecy performance under spatial correlation
by deriving analytical lower and upper bounds for the secrecy outage
probability (SOP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC), respectively. Our results
demonstrate that FRIS effectively enables secure communication under spatial
correlation. Even with partial activation, FRIS significantly outperforms
conventional RISs in enhancing secrecy performance under varying deployment
densities and element correlations.

Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for
implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It
provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming
techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in
hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the
crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit
signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of
hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is
centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted
signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system
by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the
non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between
the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through
extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point
multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output
(MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility
of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.

Conclusion: URA是解决MTC通信中大量设备短包接入问题的有前景范式，本文旨在解释其核心思想而非列举所有现有解决方案。

Abstract: Current wireless networks are designed to optimize spectral efficiency for
human users, who typically require sustained connections for high-data-rate
applications like file transfers and video streaming. However, these networks
are increasingly inadequate for the emerging era of machine-type communications
(MTC). With a vast number of devices exhibiting sporadic traffic patterns
consisting of short packets, the grant-based multiple access procedures
utilized by existing networks lead to significant delays and inefficiencies. To
address this issue the unsourced random access (URA) paradigm has been
proposed. This paradigm assumes the devices to share a common encoder thus
simplifying the reception process by eliminating the identification procedure.
The URA paradigm not only addresses the computational challenges but it also
considers the random access (RA) as a coding problem, i.e., takes into account
both medium access protocols and physical layer effects. In this monograph we
provide a comprehensive overview of the URA problem in noisy channels, with the
main task being to explain the major ideas rather than to list all existing
solutions.

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理可以有效增强导航代理的上下文理解能力，提高导航准确性。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Conclusion: LLM/Agent驱动的数据分析技术已产生重要影响，但仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

TL;DR: 提出模块化AI代理架构，通过自然语言接口连接企业数据仓库，实现透明决策和自动化评估，在保险理赔案例中验证了系统的可靠性和可信性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非技术用户访问复杂数据仓库的挑战，弥合语义鸿沟，确保AI决策的透明性和可解释性。

Method: 采用模块化组件架构，包含多层推理框架、统计上下文模块和自动化评估机制，集成BigQuery生态系统进行安全数据检索和业务规则应用。

Result: 在保险理赔处理系统的案例研究中，系统能够生成可审计的决策依据，客观评估性能，检测回归问题，证明在数据敏感领域的可靠性。

Conclusion: 该集成框架为高风险领域部署LLM驱动的AI代理提供了稳健、可评估且可信的解决方案。

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: 提出Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT)自适应推理范式，统一不同推理模式，通过AdaVaR框架实现上下文自适应模式选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，虽然能在特定领域取得改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 提出AdaVaR两阶段自适应视觉推理学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过AdaGRPO强化学习算法诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景下实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

*Seungpil Lee,Donghyeon Shin,Yunjeong Lee,Sundong Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在赌博任务中表现出类似人类赌博成瘾的认知偏见，包括控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和追逐损失等行为，且自主权增加会放大风险倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域的广泛应用，理解其潜在病态决策行为具有实际意义，需要探究LLMs是否会产生类似人类赌博成瘾的行为模式。

Method: 通过老虎机实验系统分析LLM决策，在认知行为和神经层面进行研究，使用稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析。

Result: 在老虎机实验中识别出人类赌博成瘾的认知特征；当LLMs拥有自主决定目标金额和投注大小的自由时，破产率显著上升且非理性行为增加；神经分析确认模型行为由抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化类似人类的认知偏见和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，这强调了金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型展现出与人类相当的强大劝说能力，这既带来潜在益处也引发社会担忧。但由于人类劝说效果在不同领域差异显著，系统评估LLMs的劝说能力具有挑战性。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有人类-人类劝说数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLMs进行策略性劝说。

Result: 前沿模型能持续实现高劝说收益，并展现出与理论预测一致的精妙劝说策略。通过强化学习，即使是小型LLMs也能获得显著更高的劝说收益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展的框架来评估和训练LLMs的劝说能力，证明了强化学习在提升模型劝说效果方面的有效性，为理解和发展LLMs的劝说能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

*Sumanth Varambally,Thomas Voice,Yanchao Sun,Zhifeng Chen,Rose Yu,Ke Ye*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证的智能框架，通过协调推理LLM、证明器LLM、验证器和定理检索器，显著提升了数学问题解决能力，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明器LLM在形式语言中解决的问题远少于通用LLM在自然语言中解决的问题，存在明显的性能差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题分解为子目标，使用推理LLM或证明器LLM解决，并利用验证器反馈来修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题(70.0%)，比SeedProver(50.4%)表现更好，比最佳公开基线提升422%。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式证明生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来确定何时以及如何将一个模型实例的发现泛化到其他模型，这构成了一个基本认识论挑战。

Method: 提出了五个机制对应轴（功能、发展、位置、关系和配置），并在Pythia模型的不同随机种子中分析1-back注意力头的发育轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力头在不同模型间的发展轨迹具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；较大模型的种子显示出更早开始、更陡斜率和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLMs的构成设计属性与其涌现行为和机制进行映射。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，用几何交互替代全局排名，揭示模型的专业化能力和问题结构关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估将多维能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其本质的多维特性，需要更细粒度的评估方法。

Method: 构建几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，正确性由模型与问题的几何交互决定。

Result: 发现分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释，较大范数对应更难问题；支持泛化，新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入；揭示的LLM内部分类与人类定义类别部分对齐。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，通过提炼可重用的解题策略来动态提升弱模型性能，减少对昂贵模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复咨询昂贵模型，导致成本增加。需要一种能在线学习并减少强模型调用的方法。

Method: 当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为通用的、可重用的解题策略。这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态提升性能，无需计算和时间密集的微调。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升了弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统性能（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少了强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）和相应费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识迁移，为开源和基于API的LLM提供了一个通用、可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归方法虽然能拟合可解释模型，但这些模型往往与已有理论脱节。当新数据和假设与现有理论不一致时，需要自动化推理来弥补这一差距。

Method: 使用代数几何方法，给定不完整的公理系统和无法解释的假设，自动生成一组最小的缺失公理，前提是公理和假设可以表示为多项式方程。

Result: 建立了成功检索此类公理的充分必要条件，并通过解释开普勒第三定律等案例展示了方法的有效性，即使在关键公理缺失的情况下也能工作。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动化地发现缺失的公理，为科学发现中的溯因推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI系统评估中的关键空白，为理解任务与目标对齐关系提供了有效工具，有助于提升Agentic AI系统的开发和优化效果。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia游戏的信息不对称和心理理论推理特性使其成为评估LLM社会智能的理想测试平台，但需要简化版本来进行系统性研究。

Method: 设计四人简化版游戏（1黑手党、1侦探、2村民），建立两阶段基准测试框架：先在固定对手配置下估计胜率，然后使用标准化评分汇总表现。

Result: 实验显示反直觉结果，包括较小模型有时优于较大模型。基准还揭示了多智能体动态现象，如姓名偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅为LLM社会智能提供基准测试，还能生成欺骗检测训练数据，追踪模型欺骗能力，对AI安全有贡献。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Motivation: 解决软件工程中LLM应用的两种范式（SWE-Agent多轮交互与Agentless单轮可验证步骤）之间的割裂，证明它们并非互斥，而是可以相互补充。

Method: 首先设计Agentless训练方法，开发开源SWE LLM模型Kimi-Dev，然后通过5k公开轨迹的SFT微调，将获得的技能先验迁移到SWE-Agent框架中。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%性能，是工作流方法中最好的；经过微调后，SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet性能相当。

Conclusion: Agentless训练产生的结构化技能先验能够有效桥接工作流和代理框架，实现可迁移的编码代理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同类别和阶段LLM的风险特征，展示了后训练如何调节这些特征，为行为对齐和风险感知LLM设计的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and

TL;DR: 提出了MNPO框架，将Nash学习从两人博弈扩展到多人博弈，以更好地捕捉现实世界偏好的非传递性和异质性特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法和两人Nash学习框架无法充分捕捉现实世界偏好的复杂结构，存在单一对手偏差问题。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n人博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: 在指令跟随基准测试中，MNPO持续优于现有NLHF基线方法，在异质标注条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂、非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过创建经典心理意象任务的新变体，测试LLMs在视觉心理意象任务上的表现，发现最佳LLMs表现显著优于人类平均水平，挑战了此类任务必须依赖视觉心理意象的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上，大型语言模型在训练数据中包含的任务和纯语言任务上表现最佳，这限制了我们对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能够完成认知心理学家认为必须依赖视觉心理意象才能解决的任务。

Method: 创建了几十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，测试多个最先进的LLMs，让纯文本模型根据书面指令报告变换后的结果。同时测试了100名人类受试者作为基线。还测试了不同推理级别的推理模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平。当模型分配更多推理token时，性能最强。这表明最佳LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性质的。

Conclusion: 研究不仅展示了LLMs在执行新任务时的涌现认知能力，还为该领域提供了一个新的测试任务。研究结果重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征格式的辩论，表明命题推理（或至少非意象推理）可能足以完成长期以来被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Attention Anchor框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型的注意力机制，减少幻觉并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖图像和文本token的直接拼接，导致跨模态语义相关token之间需要长距离注意力，这是模型产生幻觉和性能不佳的主要原因

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，将语义相似的跨模态token分组，在相关视觉块附近插入文本token作为语义路标，引导模型关注正确的图像区域

Result: 在15个不同指标和基准测试中的13个取得改进，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B，仅增加0.1%推理时间开销

Conclusion: Attention Anchor通过跨模态token分组有效改善了视觉语言模型的注意力机制，是首个研究混合模态token分组的工作

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Motivation: 探索LLM在传感器丰富的工业环境中进行自主健康监测的潜力，特别是检测和分类故障的能力，同时通过自然语言推理提供可解释的输出。

Method: 系统评估LLM系统架构（单LLM vs 多LLM）、输入表示（原始数据 vs 描述性统计）和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供汇总统计输入时表现最佳，多LLM系统使用专用提示在故障分类方面比单LLM系统具有更高的灵敏度。LLM能产生详细且人类可读的决策理由，但在持续学习环境中适应能力有限，在重复故障周期中难以校准预测。

Conclusion: LLM系统在复杂环境中作为透明、自适应诊断工具既有前景也存在当前局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定大型复杂计算机系统及其正确性验证至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小型代码而非完整系统，需要评估AI是否能够处理现实系统组件并将其复杂行为属性抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 开发SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+作为规范语言，自动化评估指标包括语法和运行时正确性、与系统代码的一致性以及不变式正确性。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含九个不同的系统组件：Etcd和Redis的Raft实现、Asterinas OS中的Spinlock和Mutex等，更多组件正在积极添加中。

Conclusion: SysMoBench能够帮助我们理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限性，为该领域工具奠定坚实基础并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法揭示模型在数学推理中的系统性问题，需要更精细的动态诊断方法来评估推理的保真度和一致性。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率解析指标。

Result: 在五个闭式问题族中发现了系统的低通行为和增长的相位滞后现象，能够区分前沿模型和中层模型的动态性能。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一种紧凑、可复现的协议，通过可操作的推理保真度和一致性测量来补充标准基准测试，有助于进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

<details>

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调的基本热力学约束，解释为什么某些协调方案更容易被发现和采用，以及为什么多目标优化中会出现循环和欺骗行为。

Method: 使用信息论方法推导协调协议的最小描述长度公式，引入协调温度概念来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理到拓扑版本来分析偏好聚合问题。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量、目标数量和精度呈特定比例增长，这迫使系统进行渐进简化，并导致持续的亚稳态和滞后现象。

Conclusion: 协调需要根本性的信息损失，这解释了从神经网络到官僚机构等各种系统中观察到的协调动态，包括多目标梯度下降中的循环和大型语言模型中的对齐欺骗行为。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架成功解决了Wi-Fi密集部署中的碰撞和公平性问题，为下一代无线网络提供了可行的信道接入优化方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受任务类型和温度配置影响较大，需要一种更稳定且无需调参的解码策略。

Method: 基于信息论的p-less采样方法，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需任何超参数。

Result: 在数学推理、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样始终优于现有方法，在高温下文本质量下降更少，且具有更高的推理效率和更短的生成长度。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效的无超参数解码策略，在保持高质量输出的同时提高了推理效率，适用于各种生成任务。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架成功解决了MEGI环境中LLM推理部署的挑战，为资源受限的边缘设备提供了高效的智能推理解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于视觉语言模型的进程奖励模型（VL-PRM）框架，通过混合数据合成、感知级监督和测试时扩展策略，显著提升了多模态推理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言PRMs依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索构建数据，会产生噪声监督信号且跨任务泛化能力有限，需要探索更有效的VL-PRM设计空间。

Method: 1) 结合MCTS与强VLM判断的混合数据合成框架；2) 感知级监督机制，显式检测视觉推理阶段的错误；3) 系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试中，VL-PRMs作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现优于进程步骤选择，小模型可匹敌大模型，感知级监督带来显著增益，且能发掘强VLM的潜在推理能力。

Conclusion: VL-PRMs能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，感知级监督和测试时扩展策略是关键因素，为VLM发展提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了GUI-PRA，一种针对GUI任务的流程奖励代理，通过动态内存机制和自适应UI感知来解决标准流程奖励模型在GUI领域中的“中间迷失”现象和缺乏UI变化感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，标准流程奖励模型在处理密集人工输入和长历史数据时存在“中间迷失”现象，且缺乏对GUI动态变化的感知能力。

Method: GUI-PRA包含动态内存机制（相关性检索模块和渐进式摘要模块）和自适应UI感知机制，能够智能处理历史上下文并主动感知UI状态变化。

Result: GUI-PRA能够比标准流程奖励模型更好地提供流程奖励，通过聚焦相关上下文和基于当前UI环境的评估来指导GUI代理。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过创新的动态内存和UI感知机制，有效解决了GUI任务中流程奖励模型的关键挑战，为GUI代理提供了更可靠的指导。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Motivation: 研究人工智能技术与社会经济系统深度融合背景下，AI协作在资源约束条件下对社会总产出的影响机制。

Method: 构建五个逐步扩展的异质主体模型：纯人类协作基线模型、引入AI协作模型、加入主体网络效应模型、主体作为独立生产者模型、整合网络效应和独立生产的综合模型。

Result: AI代理能显著增加社会总产出；考虑主体间网络效应时，产出增长呈现非线性特征，远超个体贡献简单加总；同等资源投入下，独立生产者模式具有更高长期增长潜力；网络效应进一步展现出强规模报酬递增特性。

Conclusion: AI协作在资源约束下能有效提升社会总产出，网络效应和独立生产者模式是实现更高增长潜力的关键因素，为AI与社会经济系统融合提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理方法存在工具使用不足或过度、工具调用后过度思考等问题，需要激励LLM高效准确地进行推理。

Method: 基于信息熵分析工具调用对推理的影响，采用连续自演化采样构建数据集，并进行两阶段微调（SFT和自演化DPO）。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验证明Tool-Light能显著提升模型执行TIR任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过熵引导的采样和多阶段训练，有效解决了工具集成推理中的效率问题。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，通过识别计算器模式和算法模式来改进工具集成推理，显著提升了代码使用和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽略了如何应用工具，错误的选择模式即使推理正确也会导致失败。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先从计算器模式和算法模式构建代码能力，然后将模式选择与教师偏好对齐。

Result: 在数学数据集上显著改进，MATH500的Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，AIME24从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知方法对工具集成推理非常有效，强调了正确选择工具应用模式的重要性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: JET方法训练大型推理模型主动终止不必要的推理步骤，通过轨迹截断和质量控制的长度奖励，在保持准确性的同时显著提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在rollout阶段构建短推理路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤冗余。

Method: 提出JET方法：1）在rollout阶段进行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径；2）使用质量控制的长度奖励，在保持正确性的同时鼓励简洁推理。

Result: JET显著提高了推理效率而不牺牲准确性。DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准测试中准确率提升4.6%，同时输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET通过主动终止冗余推理步骤，有效平衡了推理模型的准确性和效率，为大型推理模型的实际应用提供了可行的优化方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

TL;DR: EHR-ChatQA是一个交互式数据库问答基准，评估数据库代理处理查询模糊性和值不匹配问题的能力，通过两种交互流程测试代理在电子健康记录数据访问中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的代理在电子健康记录数据访问中应用受限，缺乏能捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准，主要面临查询模糊性和术语不匹配两大挑战。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA基准，在模拟环境中使用LLM用户评估代理，包含增量查询优化和自适应查询优化两种交互流程，测试代理澄清问题、解决值不匹配和生成正确SQL的能力。

Result: 实验显示代理在IncreQA上Pass@5达到90-95%，AdaptQA上60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验均成功）显著降低35-60%，表明代理缺乏稳定性。

Conclusion: 需要构建不仅性能优秀且稳健的代理，特别是在安全关键的电子健康记录领域，同时提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解以指导未来开发。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any

how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型代理的方法，用于二进制代码相似性检测，通过结构化推理分析汇编代码生成可解释特征，解决了现有方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制代码相似性检测是逆向工程的核心任务，但现有方法存在可解释性差、泛化能力不足和可扩展性受限的问题。手工特征虽然可解释但不够深入，嵌入方法泛化能力强但缺乏可解释性且面临精度与可扩展性的权衡。

Method: 使用语言模型代理对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常数和算法意图等特征。这些特征既丰富又自适应，同时保持人类可读性，可使用倒排或关系索引直接搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的recall@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合时显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于情境多臂老虎机的动态信任校准方法，通过标准化信任校准指标来优化人机协作决策性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏客观、标准化的方法来测量人机信任校准，现有方法无法区分意见形成和后续决策，且缺乏跨情境的一致性指标

Method: 使用情境多臂老虎机自适应算法，结合情境信息动态评估何时信任AI贡献，提出标准化信任校准指标

Result: 在三个不同数据集上评估，有效信任校准使决策性能显著提升，奖励指标提高10-38%

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强理论理解，还为关键领域（如疾病诊断和刑事司法）开发更可信AI系统提供实践指导

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

*Ashwin Ramaswamy,Nestor Demeure,Ermal Rrapaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM自身判断一致性作为Elo评分代理指标的方法，可以低成本评估模型性能而无需人工参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新LLM不断发布，但参数数量不能准确反映性能，需要独立评估方法。传统Elo评分需要人工比较，成本高昂。

Method: 让LLM判断模型对决结果，通过其选择一致性作为代理指标，该指标与人类产生的Elo评分有91%相关性。

Result: LLM判断一致性指标与人类Elo评分高度相关（91%），可作为低成本替代方案。

Conclusion: LLM自身的判断一致性是有效的Elo评分代理指标，能够大幅降低模型评估成本。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体编排是否能通过集体决策超越单个LLM的性能，并探索影响编排效果的因素。

Method: 使用四种LLM在三个基准测试上进行实验：对比编排与单模型基线，并在GPQA-Diamond上消融研究作者身份显示和实时投票显示的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越最强单模型，始终优于其他模型。显示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示实时投票会加剧从众效应，加速收敛但可能导致过早共识。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排有潜力进一步提升性能，但需注意信息透明度对投票行为的影响。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Motivation: 大型语言模型引入了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击，需要发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞。

Method: 使用强化学习将越狱提示形式化，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现和利用LLM对齐方法的漏洞，实现更有效的提示越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TCM-HEDPR模型，通过知识图谱扩散引导的中医处方个性化推荐方法，解决了传统方法对患者个性化信息关注不足、草药数据长尾分布和草药配伍关系忽略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中医AI处方推荐方法存在三个主要局限：对患者个性化信息（年龄、BMI、病史）关注不足；草药数据的长尾分布导致训练偏差；忽略'君臣佐使'草药配伍原则，增加毒副作用风险。

Method: 使用患者个性化提示序列预训练症状表示，应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；采用KG引导的同构图扩散方法与自注意力机制全局捕捉非线性症状-草药关系；设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验证明了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行综合评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更好地遵循'辨证论治'原则，提高处方推荐的准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈在LLM对齐中至关重要，但反馈数据往往存在噪声和不一致，这会降低奖励模型质量并阻碍对齐效果。现有自动数据清洗方法缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 开发了PrefCleanBench基准，提供标准化协议来评估清洗策略的对齐性能和泛化能力，涵盖多样化数据集、模型架构和优化算法。

Result: 通过统一和严格比较不同方法，揭示了数据清洗在LLM对齐任务中成功的关键因素，为改进数据质量提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过提升数据质量来改进LLM对齐提供了原则性和可复现的方法，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的重要作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Motivation: 扩散规划器在自动驾驶中显示出巨大潜力，但在反应式闭环环境中有效引导这些模型仍然是一个重大挑战。简单的条件设置往往无法在复杂动态驾驶场景中提供足够指导。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive方法，使用锚点引导扩散桥策略，提供原则性的扩散框架，将锚点有效转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适应不同的交通状况。该方法兼容高效的ODE求解器。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有方法提高了5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了一个有效的锚点引导扩散框架，解决了现有方法在理论一致性和性能方面的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护系统存在两个根本限制：(i)对所有用户应用统一的防护策略，忽略了相同行为对不同用户的风险差异；(ii)孤立检查每个响应，未能跟踪跨轮次的风险累积。

Method: 首先通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和捕获实时查询状态来创建个性化防护；其次在整个智能体流程中实施连续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应防护器和内存守护者等专门防护组件。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于包括LlamaGuard3和AGrail在内的现有智能体防护系统。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为基于LLM的智能体提供了一条可执行且可审计的个性化安全路径。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Result: 在多个挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具备推理能力而非仅流畅模仿的小模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR从黑盒优化重新构建为可预测的结构自组织过程，为未来AI系统涌现推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

### [397] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估稀疏自编码器特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征具有较差的敏感性，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上的可靠激活程度。

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活。

Result: 许多可解释特征具有较差的敏感性，人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

*Siqi Ma,Jiajie Huang,Bolin Yang,Fan Zhang,Jinlin Wu,Yue Shen,Guohui Fan,Zhu Zhang,Zelin Zang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MedLA框架，这是一个基于逻辑驱动的多智能体系统，用于解决复杂的医疗问题。通过将推理过程组织成基于三段论的逻辑树，实现透明推理和前提级对齐，并通过多轮图引导讨论达成共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度的逻辑不一致问题。需要一种能够进行结构化、多视角推理的框架来处理复杂的医疗问题。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提、结论）将推理过程组织成显式逻辑树，实现透明推理。智能体通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代优化逻辑树，通过错误纠正和矛盾解决达成共识。

Result: MedLA在MedDDx和标准医疗QA任务等具有挑战性的基准测试中，持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线。该框架在开源和商业LLM骨干网络上均能有效扩展，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MedLA为可信赖的医疗推理提供了一个可推广的范式，通过逻辑驱动的多智能体协作实现了更好的医疗问题解决能力。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EAPO框架，通过多轮外部专家交互增强LLM推理能力，在数学推理基准上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结果监督的RL方法存在探索效率低和奖励稀疏问题，需要改进LLM推理训练方式

Method: EAPO框架让策略模型在训练时自适应决定何时及如何咨询专家，通过多轮交互获得更丰富的奖励信号

Result: 在AIME 2024、AIME 2025、AIMO 2025等数学推理基准上，EAPO平均比自探索模型提升5分

Conclusion: 外部专家协助最终将专家知识内化到策略模型中，增强模型固有推理能力，实现独立准确推理

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了平台编排的智能体系统的故障根因识别，构建了包含307个故障日志的数据集AgentFail，开发了故障根因分类法，并建立了基于LLM的自动根因识别基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低代码平台编排的智能体系统被广泛部署，这些系统存在脆弱性且缺乏系统化的故障根因识别方法，需要研究如何识别其潜在故障根源。

Method: 构建AgentFail数据集并采用反事实推理修复策略确保标注可靠性；开发故障根因分类法；建立基于LLM的自动根因识别基准，利用分类法指导LLM。

Result: 分类法能显著提升性能，但根因识别准确率最高仅为33.6%，表明该任务仍具挑战性；提供了构建此类系统的实用指南。

Conclusion: 本文为平台编排的智能体系统提供了可靠的故障根因数据集、分类法和基准，为开发更可靠的智能体系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd是一个过程奖励模型，通过提供密集的逐步反馈来解决GUI任务中的稀疏奖励和信用分配问题，显著提升了GUI智能体的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列GUI任务中的自主智能体受到稀疏奖励和难以处理的信用分配问题的阻碍，需要更有效的监督机制。

Method: 提出了GUI-Shepherd过程奖励模型，基于包含52k交互的大规模数据集训练，该数据集包含人工标注分数和GPT-4o生成的推理过程，可作为RL训练奖励提供者和推理验证器。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，通过多轮在线PPO将成功率提高了7.7个百分点，作为推理验证器带来5.1个百分点的改进；在AndroidControl基准测试中分别获得2.2和4.3个百分点的提升。

Conclusion: 高保真过程监督对于构建更强大的GUI智能体至关重要，GUI-Shepherd提供了一个通用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Conclusion: OCEAN框架成功实现了基于对象中心表示的可解释AI，通过多智能体协商生成忠实且人类可理解的解释，在视觉分类任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在化学反应条件推荐中缺乏解释推荐理由的能力，限制了其在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。

Method: ChemMAS将任务分解为机制基础、多通道检索、约束感知智能体辩论和理由聚合四个步骤，每个决策都有基于化学知识和检索先例的可解释理由支持。

Result: 实验显示ChemMAS在Top-1准确率上比领域特定基线提升20-35%，比通用大语言模型提升10-15%，同时提供可证伪、可信赖的理由。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过证据推理提供可信赖的化学反应条件推荐。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Conclusion: FalconEye可作为MLLM安全审计的实用工具，填补了多模态内容安全评估的空白。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: AgentGuard是一个用于自主AI系统运行时验证的框架，通过动态概率保证提供连续定量保证，将代理的原始I/O抽象为状态模型中的形式化事件，并使用在线学习构建马尔可夫决策过程来建模代理的涌现行为。


<details>

Motivation: 自主AI系统的快速演进带来了显著风险，其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为使得传统验证方法不足，需要转向概率保证来评估系统在给定约束下的失败概率。

Method: AgentGuard作为检查层观察代理的原始I/O，将其抽象为状态模型转换的形式化事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程，并通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性。

Result: 该框架能够提供连续、定量的运行时保证，通过动态概率保证范式有效应对自主AI系统的不可预测性和涌现行为风险。

Conclusion: AgentGuard为自主AI系统提供了一种有效的运行时验证方法，通过动态概率保证解决了传统验证方法在处理不可预测系统时的不足。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了关于结果奖励导致错误中间步骤被强化的传统观点，指出结果奖励实际上确保了对错误步骤的负优势，应该惩罚这些动作。研究发现梯度耦合是导致错误动作被增强的关键问题，并提出了通过分类好/坏动作来分离嵌入的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为基于结果的奖励会导致奖励校准错误，错误地强化有缺陷的中间步骤。但本文发现结果奖励实际上确保了对错误步骤的负优势，应该惩罚这些动作。真正的问题是梯度耦合导致相似样本间的梯度干扰。

Method: 提出训练actor分类好/坏动作的方法，通过分离好/坏动作的嵌入来减轻梯度干扰。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够有效缓解梯度耦合问题。

Conclusion: 结果奖励本身不会强化错误动作，真正的问题是梯度耦合。通过分类好/坏动作来分离嵌入可以有效解决这一问题。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

including quant fever, reasoning blackholes, Schrodinger's compliance,
reasoning procedure mirage, and chain-oriented prompting. Experiments
demonstrate how these behaviors can be exploited on GPT-OSS-20B models, leading
to severe consequences.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

TL;DR: 提出CANON方法，通过无方向性优势估计增强目标指标的影响，在数学推理和复杂逻辑任务中优于现有方法，并能提高token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在LLM推理任务中依赖手工设计的奖励或优势塑造，这些方向性先验容易产生偏差且需要精细的超参数调优。

Method: CANON方法将采样响应按目标指标值高低分组，通过组间比较确定哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在同组内识别更好响应。

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上对数学推理和高复杂度逻辑任务均优于现有方法，基于响应长度的CANON进一步提高了token效率。

Conclusion: CANON提供了一种无需预设方向性的优势估计方法，在性能和成本权衡中产生更优的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统文献综述中搜索、筛选和分析科学文献是耗时任务，需要自动化工具来减少人工工作量，特别是机器学习方法可以自动识别相关文献。

Method: 使用语法引导遗传编程构建基于规则的可解释分类器，能够结合文本信息和文献计量数据，这是现有方法未考虑的信息源。

Conclusion: 该方法在自动文献筛选方面具有潜力，能够在保持可解释性的同时提高分类性能，为系统文献综述提供有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

TL;DR: TusoAI是一个自主开发计算方法的AI系统，通过整合领域知识和迭代优化，在科学任务中超越现有专家方法和AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学发现因手动开发计算工具而变慢，现有AI系统未能有效整合科学领域特定知识。

Method: TusoAI将领域知识整合为知识树表示，执行迭代的领域特定优化和模型诊断，改进候选解决方案池的性能。

Conclusion: TusoAI展示了AI系统自主开发优化计算方法的潜力，能够加速科学发现并揭示新的生物学见解。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，需要至少2次重复运行来获得稳定的模型排名结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能获得可靠结论尚不明确

Method: 在AI4Math基准上重新评估8个最先进模型，每个设置进行3次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估

Result: 单次运行排行榜很脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次排名反转；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行排名反转；运行平均仅带来约5%的标准误缩减但排名收益显著

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行，这些实践能提高鲁棒性且对小团队可行

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RPO是一个鲁棒偏好优化框架，通过EM算法推断标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练损失来缓解人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，显著提升了多种对齐算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好对齐方法（如RLHF）基于两个错误假设：人类偏好是同质的且数据无噪声。实际上人类偏好是多元的且标注者会犯错，这导致记录数据与真实偏好存在差异，误导模型训练并降低性能。

Method: 提出RPO框架，使用EM算法推断每个标签正确性的后验概率，自适应重加权训练数据点。建立了任意偏好损失与对应概率模型的理论联系，可将现有对齐算法系统性地转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架显著提升了四种最先进对齐算法（DPO、IPO、SimPO、CPO）的性能。在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别实现了最高7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO提供了一个系统性的框架来解决人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，理论上证明了在完美校准模型下能收敛到真实噪声水平，实验验证了其作为元框架的有效性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出基于行为经济学前景理论的人类感知解释，证明在线对齐优于离线对齐的原因在于更好地模拟人类对概率的感知偏差，并提出humanline变体方法，能在离线训练中达到在线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在线对齐方法（如GRPO）通常比离线对齐方法（如DPO）表现更好，从人类感知角度提供理论解释。

Method: 基于前景理论，提出humanline设计模式，将人类对概率的感知偏差显式融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中。

Result: humanline变体即使在离线非策略数据上训练，也能在可验证和不可验证任务上达到与在线方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身并非最大化人类效用的关键，通过模拟人类感知偏差可以实现更快速、廉价、灵活的离线训练而不损失性能。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡问题：声明式方法缺乏动态环境适应性，迭代方法计算成本过高且难以扩展。

Method: 采用循环过程：1)构建意图绑定的动作序列 2)主动验证冲突和可行性 3)通过针对性机制修复问题 4)执行验证过的动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan达到可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token。

Conclusion: 为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入采用统一推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题推理不足。需要一种能根据问题复杂度自适应分配计算资源的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的引导向量来决策停止或继续推理。采用Group Relative Policy Optimization作为奖励信号调节推理深度，通过课程学习和奖励工程实现计算分配与问题难度的校准。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder在计算-精度边界上表现优异，以更低的FLOPs实现匹配的精度，优于早期退出基线方法。分析显示学习到的计算分配与问题难度相关。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder证明了通过潜在向量引导实现自适应推理深度的可行性，在不修改主干模型权重的情况下显著提升了推理效率，为LLM推理计算优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏定量规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大的回报。

Method: 通过跨熵测量语言模型融合的实证缩放定律，分析不同架构和方法下的性能变化规律。

Result: 识别出紧凑的幂律关系：模型容量相关的性能下限随模型能力增加而降低，融合尾部呈现明显的收益递减效应。

Conclusion: 该定律使模型融合从启发式实践转变为可计算、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供可预测的缩放原则。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理任务中表现出色，但经常存在过度思考问题，产生不必要的长输出并导致高延迟，这限制了其实际部署。现有的提前退出机制依赖探测机制，会引入检测开销并影响通用性。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态使用的启发，提出SpecExit框架，直接从轻量级草稿模型预测未来token和提前退出信号，无需探测开销。利用隐藏状态的固有信号提供有效的提前退出信号。

Result: 与推测解码基线相比，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟实现2.5倍加速，且不损害准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了隐藏状态在高效推理中的更广泛用途，为大型推理模型的实时部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过程序合成框架来学习协作物理任务的方法，使用可编辑的程序表示行为，并通过配对物理动作和自然语言的叙述演示作为统一的交互模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要关注非协作物理活动，协作任务需要系统推断用户对队友意图的假设，这是一个模糊且动态的过程，需要可解释和可修正的表示。

Method: 将协作任务学习构建为程序合成问题，使用可编辑程序表示行为，通过叙述演示（物理动作+自然语言）作为教学、检查和修正系统逻辑的统一方式，无需用户查看或编写代码。

Result: 在20名用户参与的多人足球战术教学实验中，70%的参与者成功将学习到的程序修正为符合其意图，90%的参与者认为修正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将学习表示为程序以及在协作物理活动中启用用户教学所面临的独特挑战，并提出了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文指出现有图推理方法存在方向性问题，提出将推理重点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，并构建了更具挑战性的GraphAlgorithm基准，同时提出了Simple-RTC基线方法，在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在图推理任务上表现不佳，作者认为这是因为现有方法和基准存在问题，需要重新思考LLM图推理的发展方向。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法，引导LLM先设计图算法然后编码来解决图推理任务，并构建了包含239个不同图问题和3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过重新定向推理重点，LLM能够有效解决图推理任务，Simple-RTC为未来LLM图推理研究提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

*Yuhua Jiang,Jiawei Huang,Yufeng Yuan,Xin Mao,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出风险敏感强化学习框架RS-GRPO，通过风险寻求目标在均值和最大奖励间插值，解决RLVR方法在预训练LLMs中面临的探索困境，提升多解性能(pass@k)同时保持或提高单解准确率(pass@1)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLMs的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法，导致只能找到狭窄的解决方案集，虽然提升了单解准确率但抑制了解决方案多样性和多解性能，往往只是蒸馏现有能力而非发现新的推理策略。

Method: 引入风险敏感强化学习框架，采用风险寻求目标在均值和最大奖励间插值，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从挑战性提示中学习来驱动深度探索，仅需少量代码修改即可实现。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试和五种不同LLMs上，RS-GRPO持续提升pass@k性能，同时保持或增强pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO有效解决了RLVR的探索困境，能够发现新的推理策略，在保持单解性能的同时显著提升多解性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统移动消息设计由于无法探索高维设计空间而存在显著局限性，需要更有效的方法来优化医疗沟通效果。

Method: 基于DIKW层次结构构建的智能代理系统，通过专门的计算代理逐步将原始实验数据转化为可操作的消息设计策略，支持并行处理、假设验证和持续学习。

Result: 在两阶段实验中（第一阶段444,691次患者接触，第二阶段74,908次），最佳生成消息的参与率达到68.76%，相比基线61.27%提升了12.2%的相对点击率改善。

Conclusion: PAME-AI的代理架构特别适合大规模医疗沟通优化，能够有效提升患者消息的参与度和效果。

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

TL;DR: AdvChain：一种通过对抗性思维链调优来增强大型推理模型安全性的对齐范式，解决思维链推理中的雪球效应问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全调优方法存在雪球效应问题，即推理过程中的微小偏差会逐步放大，导致有害顺从或过度拒绝，模型缺乏自我纠正能力

Method: 构建包含诱惑-纠正和犹豫-纠正样本的数据集，通过对抗性思维链调优教导模型动态自我纠正

Result: AdvChain显著增强了对抗越狱攻击和思维链劫持的鲁棒性，大幅减少良性提示上的过度拒绝，在保持推理能力的同时实现更优的安全-效用平衡

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法在处理知识密集型任务时存在信息碎片化和知识结构建模不足的问题，而图增强RAG方法又受限于特定的图设计、启发式搜索或昂贵的代理管道，影响可扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出QuadGraph四层抽象统一异构知识源，构建34M参数的图基础模型(GFM)联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，与LLM集成增强推理，采用混合精度训练和分布式消息传递实现可扩展性。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，G-reasoner持续优于最先进的基线方法，显著提升LLM推理能力，并实现了强大的效率和跨图泛化能力。

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一的图-语言模型集成框架，有效解决了现有RAG方法的局限性，为知识密集型推理任务提供了可扩展且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，既提供系统性评估，又为增强LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性提供了实用途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在医学诊断中存在早期证据解释不稳定导致幻觉的问题，需要开发能够约束随机性和幻觉、产生可审计决策流程的临床推理系统。

Method: 使用多样化短轨迹稳定推理，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并通过组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医学基准测试中，准确率提升高达12.7%，并展现出更优越的可靠性。盲法医生评估证实MedMMV显著提高了推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在高风险领域部署可信AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

Motivation: 解决金融科技领域LLMs在细调后可能产生不专业或轻率言论的问题，填补领域特定数据集稀缺的研究空白。

Method: 引入Fin-Vault数据集（1,417个标注多轮对话），开发Fin-Ally模型（集成COMET-BART常识推理、礼貌性和人性化对话动态，采用DPO优化机制）。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融科技领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，能够生成更专业、可信的金融建议。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中需要遍历巨大搜索空间进行路径扩展，导致效率低下且不灵活。

Method: AMCS框架在节点值估计和路径扩展层面实现自适应动态搜索：1）通过为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本、为易估计步骤分配较少样本来自适应优化估计；2）使用具有时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法增强路径扩展，从广泛探索逐步转向最有希望方向的利用。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，超越所有基线PRM；7B模型在AMCS监督下超越72B弱监督模型；在分布外问题上保持优势，展示强泛化能力。

Conclusion: AMCS通过自适应搜索策略显著提升了过程奖励模型的数据生成效率和性能，在数学推理任务中表现出色且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: PRISM框架将数学推理解耦为策略规划和目标执行两个阶段，通过轻量级策略适配器预测四种推理策略的置信度分布，并基于自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，无法适应问题特定需求，忽视了效果与效率之间的权衡。

Method: 构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，训练策略适配器获取策略置信度分布，在推理时使用自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM始终优于单个策略和集成基线，在不同基础模型上实现了0.9%到7.6%的改进。

Conclusion: 自适应路由方法在数学推理任务中表现出特别强的优势，能够有效平衡推理效果与效率。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 本文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过过程监督来对齐大型推理模型的安全推理过程，解决现有方法忽视推理过程安全性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中经常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这些不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，影响模型可信度并带来潜在风险。

Method: 提出IPO方法，通过分析安全推理特征，发现安全触发关键步骤、合规线索与不安全延续的关联性、纠正干预的有效性，然后构建偏好学习对来强制安全推理。

Result: 在越狱和对抗安全基准测试中，IPO显著提高了推理和回答的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线方法，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在多样化推理任务中保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了显式对齐推理过程的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的过程奖励模型ContextPRM，通过关注思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性，而非验证领域特定知识，来提升模型在数学和非数学领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型在数学领域表现良好，但由于缺乏领域特定训练数据和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域的泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出基于上下文连贯性的数据标注和训练框架，将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流程。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域（如法律、历史、哲学）上通过加权多数投票实现了6.5%的平均准确率提升，显著优于VersaPRM的2.2%提升和其他数学导向PRM的0.5%增益。

Conclusion: 通过关注思维链的上下文连贯性而非领域特定知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，显著提升了模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合约束获取框架，通过结合被动学习和主动查询来有效解决过拟合问题，在有限数据下实现高模型覆盖率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程中的手动建模是一个主要瓶颈，而现有的被动约束获取方法容易过拟合，主动方法则查询密集。需要一种能平衡效率和准确性的混合方法。

Method: 集成被动学习生成候选约束，使用基于概率置信度的查询驱动交互精炼来识别过拟合约束，通过子集探索机制恢复有效子结构，最后进行主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互精炼阶段对于从有限示例中实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了稳健实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Motivation: 传统方法主要关注推理时动态性或计算效率，而该方法受生物神经可塑性启发，旨在实现训练期间网络结构的动态适应性，以更好地处理多任务学习。

Method: 每个新任务触发动态网络适应，包括基于相似性的任务识别和候选ANN头部的选择性训练，然后根据性能评估并集成到模型中。

Result: 在三个真实世界多任务需求预测数据集上评估，相比传统基线和最先进的多任务学习方法，实现了更低的RMSE和标准差，表现出优越的性能和一致性。

Conclusion: NMT-Net为时间序列预测中的多任务和持续学习提供了可扩展、适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub
repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统组合优化问题需要大量领域知识和手工设计启发式算法，现有基于LLMs的方法容易陷入局部最优。

Method: EvoPH框架集成岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，共同演化提示和启发式算法，利用性能反馈进行指导。

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上，EvoPH相比最优解获得最低相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推进了基于LLMs的自动算法设计领域发展。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Motivation: 先前世界模型无法准确预测复杂环境中的物体交互，需要开发能够从离线数据学习、避免环境交互风险的可扩展智能体。

Method: 使用快捷强制目标和高效Transformer架构构建世界模型，实现实时交互推理；从少量数据学习通用动作条件，从多样化无标签视频中提取知识。

Result: 在复杂视频游戏Minecraft中，世界模型准确预测物体交互和游戏机制，大幅超越先前模型；Dreamer 4是首个仅从离线数据获得钻石的智能体。

Conclusion: 这项工作为想象训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，标志着向智能代理迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

Conclusion: 通过策略性示例选择和利用外部符号知识的学习方法，AI代理能够更有效地进行泛化学习。

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

TL;DR: 论文研究通信评估中的协调假设，发现在某些情况下即使个体使用不同的信号解释也能成功协调，这被称为"成功的误解"，但这种情况难以发现和修复，需要至少三个相互交互的个体才能确保共享解释的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设——如果个体能通过通信协调，就认为他们相互理解。在感知环境差异很大的个体（如人类和AI代理）之间，这种假设是否成立值得探讨。

Method: 使用信号博弈模型，个体在没有共同观察（除了通信信号和交互结果）的情况下开发新词汇信号来协调。代理开发信号、使用信号并改进解释，但不观察其他代理如何使用信号。

Result: 群体总能收敛到最优协调水平，但有时交互代理对信号的解释和使用不同，形成"成功的误解"。这种误解难以发现和修复，且使用不对齐解释的代理无法与新交互伙伴建立成功协调。

Conclusion: 至少三个相互交互的个体是确保共享解释出现的最小条件。在这种条件下，代理群体能够补偿信号使用缺乏共享观察的不足，确保共享解释的出现。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在面对困难问题时经常进行无意义的推理直到上下文限制，产生错误答案并浪费计算资源。这反映了现有回答范式忽视了问题与模型能力边界的关系。

Method: 研究模型是否具备能力边界自我意识：1）对黑盒模型，通过推理表达中的置信度轨迹识别边界；2）对白盒模型，通过最后一个输入token的隐藏状态编码边界信息。基于发现提出了推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种优化策略。

Result: 实验证明边界感知策略能让模型避免无意义推理而不牺牲准确性，显著提高了可靠性和效率，token使用量减少了62.7-93.6%。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具备能力边界自我意识，通过监控推理置信度和隐藏状态可以有效识别边界，从而优化模型性能，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性之间的相互作用，难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场等人类推理核心挑战的场景。

Method: 提出LogicAgent框架，在一阶逻辑中执行多视角演绎，通过包含三值决策方案（真、假、不确定）的存在导入检查来避免空洞推理，更忠实地处理边界情况。

Result: LogicAgent在RepublicQA基准上达到最先进性能，相比强基线平均提升6.25%，在主流逻辑推理基准上平均额外提升7.05%。

Conclusion: 基于符号学的多视角推理能有效提升大语言模型的逻辑性能，证明了联合处理逻辑和语义复杂性的重要性。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Result: TimeOmni-1在所有任务上表现出强大的分布外泛化能力，因果发现准确率从GPT-4.1的35.9%提升到64.0%，事件感知预测任务的有效响应率比GPT-4.1提高超过6%。

Conclusion: TSR-Suite为时间序列推理提供了首个全面评估套件，TimeOmni-1展示了统一推理模型在解决多样化现实问题中的有效性，显著提升了时间序列推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了查询电路方法，直接在模型内部追踪特定输入到输出的信息流，提供更忠实且计算可访问的局部解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要揭示全局能力电路，但无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要更精确的输入级解释。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发归一化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，并采用基于采样的方法高效识别稀疏但忠实的电路。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，发现模型内部存在极稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%的连接就能恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为语言模型如何处理单个输入提供了忠实、可扩展的解释方法。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化训练数据的逻辑推理复杂度，并基于此开发了重新认知优化策略，通过增强数据推理强度而非增加数据量来提升LLM的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换而忽视训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标量化样本的逻辑推理复杂度，并提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度，使其与LLM的推理边界更好对齐。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于以数据为中心的策略，在性能和泛化能力上都有明显提升，并在强化学习框架下得到验证。

Conclusion: 相比数据规模或表面形式，优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度对于实现LLM的全部认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，需要复杂的推理和多模态理解，但在AI研究中尚未充分探索。现有方法主要是单一模型，开源MLLM很少能达到金牌水平。

Method: 提出PhysicsMinions系统，包含三个协同工作室：视觉工作室解释图表、逻辑工作室制定解决方案、评审工作室进行双阶段验证。系统通过迭代精炼循环协同进化，评审工作室的反馈持续指导逻辑工作室，实现自我修正并收敛到真实答案。

Result: 在HiPhO基准测试中取得三大突破：1）强泛化能力：持续改进不同规模的开源和闭源模型；2）历史性突破：将开源模型金牌数从1-2个提升到6个，在最新IPhO中实现开源模型首个金牌；3）达到人类专家水平：在最新IPhO中排名第4/406，远超最佳单模型排名第22。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级问题解决提供了一个可推广的框架，具有跨学科扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的社会科学研究领域较为分散，需要系统性的分类框架来整合现有研究，明确证据标准，促进该领域的累积性进展。

Method: 采用文本嵌入、无监督聚类和主题建模等方法，对270项研究进行系统性回顾，构建计算分类法。

Result: 识别出三个有机形成的核心领域：LLM作为社会心智（认知、道德和偏见归因）、LLM社会（多智能体交互与制度形成）、LLM-人类互动（任务重塑、信任和工作影响）。

Conclusion: 该分类法为碎片化的研究领域提供了可复现的地图，澄清了不同分析层次的证据标准，突出了人工智能社会科学中累积性进展的机会。

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: RealUnify是一个专门评估多模态模型中理解与生成能力双向协同作用的基准测试，包含1000个人工标注实例，通过双评估协议分析模型是否能在理解与生成之间实现有效协同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要孤立评估理解和生成能力，无法确定统一模型是否能利用理解来增强生成，或通过生成模拟来促进更深层次的理解。

Method: 构建包含10个类别和32个子任务的RealUnify基准，围绕两个核心轴：理解增强生成（需要推理指导图像生成）和生成增强理解（需要心理模拟解决推理任务）。采用双评估协议：直接端到端评估和诊断性分步评估。

Result: 对12个领先统一模型和6个专业基线的评估表明，当前统一模型在实现有效协同方面仍存在困难，表明仅靠架构统一是不够的。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索使用语义嵌入来复制心理测量结构的可行性。

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理LLM嵌入，从修订版肖像价值问卷(PVQ-RR)中恢复人类价值观结构，比较多种嵌入模型和评估指标。

Result: 嵌入方法能解释55%的维度相似性方差，多维标度配置显示良好因子一致性，成功获得维度间负相关。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制心理测量结构，在成本、扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量学和社会科学研究提供了补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Conclusion: 为神经科学及其他领域提供了一个更通用、可扩展和自动化的方法，将理论知识整合到数据驱动的科学探究中。

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Conclusion: MASLegalBench填补了法律领域多智能体系统评估方法的空白，为未来MAS在法律任务中的应用提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，这些发现有助于促进协同感知系统的设计和修复工作。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线强化学习方法通常对所有训练样本采用统一处理，忽视了问题难度与模型当前能力之间的巨大差异，导致学习效率低下和性能上限受限。

Method: CLPO算法利用模型自身的表现进行实时难度评估，构建在线课程，并通过自适应问题重构机制，让模型作为自己的教师：对中等难度问题进行多样化以促进泛化，对挑战性问题进行简化以使其更易掌握。

Result: 在八个具有挑战性的数学和通用推理基准测试中，CLPO实现了最先进的性能，平均pass@1指标比其他方法提高了6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同进化的动态过程，证明了其能够更有效地训练更具能力的推理模型。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

TL;DR: AutoPlay是一个可扩展的任务生成管道，通过探索交互环境自动合成多样化的任务，用于训练多模态大语言模型代理，显著减少对人类标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息，成本高且扩展性差，需要自动生成高质量、多样化、可执行和可验证的任务数据集来扩展多模态大语言模型的后期训练。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段方法：探索阶段使用MLLM探索代理系统性地发现环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指导提示作为上下文，合成多样化、可执行和可验证的任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用中生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用中生成10k任务，训练移动使用和计算机使用代理，成功率分别提高20.0%和10.9%，结合强化学习额外获得5.7%增益。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为后期训练MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，显著减少对人类标注的依赖，能够生成高质量的任务数据集用于代理训练。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CEL是一种新型智能体架构，使用大型语言模型通过推理和规划来学习游戏，能够自主发现环境规则并制定有效策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度强化学习方法依赖大量经验且知识编码不透明，需要更通用、可解释的智能体，能够通过显式推理构建对世界的透明理解。

Method: CEL采用交互-反思循环：在每次游戏后分析完整轨迹，并行进行规则归纳（精炼环境动态模型）和策略总结（提炼可操作策略手册）。

Result: 在多种网格世界任务（扫雷、冰冻湖、推箱子）中，CEL成功掌握了这些游戏，从稀疏奖励中自主发现规则并开发有效策略。

Conclusion: CEL展示了构建更通用、可解释智能体的路径，这些智能体不仅有效行动，还通过显式推理构建对世界的透明且不断改进的模型。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

TL;DR: HeDA是一个用于热浪风险发现的多智能体系统，通过构建知识图谱和多层风险传播分析，从10,247篇学术论文中识别被忽视的风险传导路径，发现了5条新的高风险链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热浪在气候、社会和经济系统中造成复杂的级联风险，但科学文献中的知识碎片化阻碍了对这些风险路径的全面理解。

Method: 构建包含23,156个节点和89,472个关系的知识图谱，采用多层风险传播分析方法，处理10,247篇学术论文。

Result: 系统在复杂问答任务中达到78.9%准确率，比GPT-4高出13.7%，发现了5条以前未知的高影响风险链。

Conclusion: 这项工作为AI驱动的科学发现提供了新范式，为制定更具韧性的气候适应策略提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate
adaptation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，特别是通过组合现有技能来获得新的组合能力，这种能力还能泛化到更复杂的任务和不同领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于RL在LLM后训练中作用的争论：RL是真正教授新技能还是仅仅重新加权现有推理策略。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力，研究LLM在RL训练后能否学习未见过的函数组合。

Result: RL使LLMs能够学习未见过的函数组合，这种组合能力能泛化到更复杂的多函数组合，并能迁移到不同任务中，而相同数据的下一词训练无法实现这些效果。

Conclusion: RL能从根本上改变模型的推理行为，让LLMs获得真正的新技能，建议先构建具有基础技能的基座模型，然后用RL激励高级、可泛化的复杂问题解决技能。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RLHI（基于人类交互的强化学习）范式，通过从真实用户对话中学习来实现持续模型改进和多方面对齐，包含用户引导重写和基于用户奖励两种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家生成人类反馈进行对齐，但为了持续改进和多方面对齐，模型需要从自然人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发了两种互补方法：1）用户引导重写：根据用户的自然语言后续响应修订不满意的模型输出；2）基于用户奖励：通过基于用户长期交互历史（个人档案）的奖励模型学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 自然人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

TL;DR: ReasoningBank是一个新颖的记忆框架，通过从智能体成功和失败的经验中提炼可泛化的推理策略，使智能体能够从历史交互中学习并持续改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型智能体在持续现实世界任务中无法从积累的交互历史中学习，导致重复过去的错误和浪费宝贵见解。

Method: 提出ReasoningBank记忆框架，从智能体自我判断的成功和失败经验中提炼推理策略；引入内存感知测试时扩展(MaTTS)，通过扩展智能体交互体验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank始终优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，提高了有效性和效率；MaTTS进一步放大了这些收益。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了内存驱动经验扩展作为一个新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在需要串行视觉处理的任务上表现不佳，与人类反应时间呈负相关，揭示了当前VLMs在串行视觉推理能力上的根本瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单视觉推理任务上却不如人类，假设是缺乏视觉基础的串行处理能力。

Method: 通过三个领域（几何推理、感知枚举、心理旋转）设计任务，改变串行处理需求，比较人类和VLM表现，用人类反应时间作为串行处理负载的代理指标。

Result: 所有领域都显示一致模式：VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加强相关，串行处理需求越高，VLM与人类表现差距越大。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在串行、视觉基础的推理能力上存在根本性限制，这是区别于人类的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

TL;DR: UniAPL提出统一对抗偏好学习框架，通过单阶段联合训练解决SFT和RL之间的分布不匹配问题，在指令跟随任务中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT+RL序列化训练存在分布不匹配问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，导致SFT知识脆弱；后续RL探索时无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识。

Method: 将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习，让密集专家演示直接规范和指导在线探索。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上性能提升5.77%（达到32B模型水平），在Qwen3-4B上提升3.75%，甚至超越教师模型。响应长度和log概率分布分析确认UniAPL输出更接近专家演示。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，验证了统一偏好学习方法的有效性。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有偏见和脆弱性，在学术同行评审等敏感场景中需要区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法无法有效处理判断检测任务。

Method: 引入J-Detector，一个轻量透明的神经网络检测器，通过显式提取语言特征和LLM增强特征，将LLM判断者的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM判断者的偏见，并验证了判断检测在实际场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: LLM生成的判断具有可检测性，J-Detector能够有效检测这些判断并量化其中的偏见，为敏感场景中的判断可靠性评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有SQL基准测试不适合SQL到SQL的评估，因为它们关注有限的数据库系统（通常只有SQLite），无法捕捉许多系统特定的SQL方言（如自定义函数、数据类型和语法规则）。

Method: PARROT从38个开源基准和真实业务服务中收集了598个翻译对，并提供多个基准变体：PARROT-Diverse（28,003个翻译用于广泛语法测试）和PARROT-Simple（5,306个代表性样本用于集中压力测试）。

Result: 在PARROT基准测试中，大型语言模型在跨系统SQL翻译任务上的平均准确率低于38.53%，表明该任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: PARROT填补了跨系统SQL翻译基准测试的空白，为未来研究提供了实用的评估工具，并发布了公共排行榜和源代码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in
Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL
Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database
system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g.,
ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored.
Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which
(1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2)
cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions,
data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a
Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT
comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world
business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL
understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We
also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003
translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306
representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22

Motivation: 现有子图查询方法依赖启发式顶点匹配顺序，可能显著降低枚举性能。基于学习的优化器在关系数据库中有效，但由于图数据的异构性、模式灵活性和大量连接操作，无法直接应用于子图查询。

Method: 提出NeuSO优化器，包含高效的查询图编码器和估计器，使用多任务框架训练来估计子查询基数和执行成本，并采用自顶向下的计划枚举器生成执行计划。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，NeuSO在性能和效率上都优于现有的子图查询排序方法。

Conclusion: NeuSO解决了子图查询优化中的挑战，实现了高准确性和效率，为图数据库系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph query is a critical task in graph analysis with a wide range of
applications across various domains. Most existing methods rely on heuristic
vertex matching orderings, which may significantly degrade enumeration
performance for certain queries. While learning-based optimizers have recently
gained attention in the context of relational databases, they cannot be
directly applied to subgraph queries due to the heterogeneous and
schema-flexible nature of graph data, as well as the large number of joins
involved in subgraph queries. These complexities often leads to inefficient
online performance, making such approaches impractical for real-world graph
database systems. To address this challenge, we propose NeuSO, a novel
learning-based optimizer for subgraph queries that achieves both high accuracy
and efficiency. NeuSO features an efficient query graph encoder and an
estimator which are trained using a multi-task framework to estimate both
subquery cardinality and execution cost. Based on these estimates, NeuSO
employs a top-down plan enumerator to generate high-quality execution plans for
subgraph queries. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that
NeuSO outperforms existing subgraph query ordering approaches in both
performance and efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了标记图中k-mer的计算问题，证明了在确定性DAG中计数不同k-mer是#P难的，但在Wheeler图中可在O(|W|k)或O(n⁴logk)时间内完成，并提出了de Bruijn图的高效构建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究标记图中k-mer的计算问题，特别是在基因组学应用中，需要高效处理图中的k-mer以构建de Bruijn图等数据结构。

Method: 使用Wheeler图作为计算模型，提出前缀加倍技术的推广，并讨论将一般图转换为Wheeler图的方法。

Result: 在确定性Wheeler图中，不同k-mer计数可在O(|W|k)或O(n⁴logk)时间内完成；de Bruijn图构建时间为O(|dBg| + |W|k)。

Conclusion: Wheeler图为k-mer计算提供了高效框架，相比传统方法在构建de Bruijn图时具有理论优势，特别是当k较大时。

Abstract: We initiate the study of computational problems on $k$-mers (strings of
length $k$) in labeled graphs. As a starting point, we consider the problem of
counting the number of distinct $k$-mers found on the walks of a graph. We
establish that this is #P-hard, even on connected deterministic DAGs. However,
in the class of deterministic Wheeler graphs (Gagie, Manzini, and Siren, TCS
2017), we show that distinct $k$-mers of such a graph $W$ can be counted using
$O(|W|k)$ or $O(n^4 \log k)$ arithmetic operations, where $n$ is the number of
vertices of the graph, and $|W|$ is $n$ plus the number of edges. The latter
result uses a new generalization of the technique of prefix doubling to Wheeler
graphs. To generalize our results beyond Wheeler graphs, we discuss ways to
transform a graph into a Wheeler graph in a manner that preserves the $k$-mers.
  As an application of our $k$-mer counting algorithms, we construct a
representation of the de Bruijn graph (dBg) of the $k$-mers in time $O(|dBg| +
|W|k)$. Given that the Wheeler graph can be exponentially smaller than the de
Bruijn graph, for large $k$ this provides a theoretical improvement over
previous de Bruijn graph construction methods from graphs, which must spend
$\Omega(k)$ time per $k$-mer in the graph. Our representation occupies $O(|dBg|
+ |W|k \log(\max_{1 \leq \ell \leq k}(n_\ell)))$ bits of space, where $n_\ell$
is the number of distinct $l$-mers in the Wheeler graph.

*Fuming Yang,Yaron Meirovitch,Jeff W. Lichtman*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 提出一种从噪声局部采样比较矩阵中恢复1D排序的方法，使用O(N(log N + K))次查询实现精确序列化，适用于各种局部结构化排序任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在有限查询预算下从噪声局部采样比较矩阵中恢复1D排序的问题，传统方法查询复杂度高，需要更高效的算法。

Method: 五阶段流水线：随机钩Boruvka步骤连接组件、迭代凝聚约束图直径、双扫BFS获取临时全局顺序、固定窗口密集化、贪心SuperChain组装最终排列。

Result: 在简单top-1边界和有限相对噪声下证明精确恢复；实验显示仅需约2N/3真实邻接即可成功；在晶圆级串行切片EM上优于谱方法、MST和TSP基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限查询下实现精确序列化，适用于时间快照排序、考古序列化和播放列表构建等多种局部结构化排序任务。

Abstract: We study recovering a 1D order from a noisy, locally sampled pairwise
comparison matrix under a tight query budget. We recast the task as
reconstructing a sparse, noisy line graph and present, to our knowledge, the
first method that provably builds a sparse graph containing all edges needed
for exact seriation using only O(N(log N + K)) oracle queries, which is
near-linear in N for fixed window K. The approach is parallelizable and
supports both binary and bounded-noise distance oracles. Our five-stage
pipeline consists of: (i) a random-hook Boruvka step to connect components via
short-range edges in O(N log N) queries; (ii) iterative condensation to bound
graph diameter; (iii) a double-sweep BFS to obtain a provisional global order;
(iv) fixed-window densification around that order; and (v) a greedy SuperChain
that assembles the final permutation. Under a simple top-1 margin and bounded
relative noise we prove exact recovery; empirically, SuperChain still succeeds
when only about 2N/3 of true adjacencies are present. On wafer-scale
serial-section EM, our method outperforms spectral, MST, and TSP baselines with
far fewer comparisons, and is applicable to other locally structured sequencing
tasks such as temporal snapshot ordering, archaeological seriation, and
playlist/tour construction.

Abstract: We study the number of distance queries needed to identify certain properties
of a hidden tree $T$ on $n$ vertices. A distance query consists of two vertices
$x,y$, and the answer is the distance of $x$ and $y$ in $T$. We determine the
number of queries an optimal adaptive algorithm needs to find two vertices of
maximal distance up to an additive constant, and the number of queries needed
to identify the hidden tree asymptotically. We also study the non-adaptive
versions of these problems, determining the number of queries needed exactly.

### [480] [Stochastic Embedding of Digraphs into DAGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23458)
*Arnold Filtser*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将加权有向图随机嵌入到DAG（有向无环图）的方法，实现了O(log n)的期望失真和O(m)的稀疏度，显著改进了之前O(log³ n)的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有向图的度量嵌入是图算法中的重要问题，但现有方法在失真度和稀疏度方面存在不足。本文旨在开发更高效的随机嵌入技术，以降低失真度并保持较低的稀疏度。

Method: 构建一个随机分布，生成一对DAG，保持原图的可达性（每个可达对至少在一个DAG中可达），同时控制距离失真。通过精心设计的算法确保嵌入的稀疏性和高效采样。

Result: 对于n个顶点、m条边的有向图，实现了O(log n)的期望失真和O(m)的稀疏度，采样时间为O(m)。相比之前最好的O(log³ n)失真结果有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为有向图度量嵌入提供了更优的解决方案，在失真度和稀疏度之间达到了更好的平衡，且具有高效的采样复杂度。

Abstract: Given a weighted digraph $G=(V,E,w)$, a stochastic embedding into DAGs is a
distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over pairs of DAGs $(D_1,D_2)$ such that for every
$u,v$: (1) the reachability is preserved: $u\rightsquigarrow_G v$ (i.e., $v$ is
reachable from $u$ in $G$) implies that $u\rightsquigarrow_{D_1} v$ or
$u\rightsquigarrow_{D_2} v$ (but not both), and (2) distances are dominated:
$d_G(u,v)\le\min\{d_{D_1}(u,v),d_{D_2}(u,v)\}$. The stochastic embedding
$\mathcal{D}$ has expected distortion $t$ if for every $u,v\in V$, \[
\mathbb{E}_{(D_{1},D_{2})\sim\mathcal{D}}\left[d_{D_{1}}(u,v)\cdot\boldsymbol{1}[u\rightsquigarrow_{D_{1}}v]+d_{D_{2}}(u,v)\cdot\boldsymbol{1}[u\rightsquigarrow_{D_{2}}v]\right]\le
t\cdot d_{G}(u,v)~. \] Finally, the sparsity of $\mathcal{D}$ is the maximum
number of edges in any of the DAGs in its support. Given an $n$ vertex digraph
with $m$ edges, we construct a stochastic embedding into DAGs with expected
distortion $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ and $\tilde{O}(m)$ sparsity, improving a
previous result by Assadi, Hoppenworth, and Wein [STOC 25], which achieved
expected distortion $\tilde{O}(\log^3 n)$. Further, we can sample DAGs from
this distribution in $\tilde{O}(m)$ time.

Conclusion: 图缩减技术在实现高性能图着色算法中发挥关键作用，RECOL为大规模现实图的高效着色提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The graph coloring problem is a classical combinatorial optimization problem
with important applications such as register allocation and task scheduling,
and it has been extensively studied for decades. However, near-real-time
algorithms that can deliver high-quality solutions for very large real-world
graphs within a strict time frame remain relatively underexplored. In this
paper, we try to bridge this gap by systematically investigating reduction
rules that shrink the problem size while preserving optimality. For the first
time, domination reduction, complement crown reduction, and independent set
reduction are applied to large-scale instances. Building on these techniques,
we propose RECOL, a reduction-based algorithm that alternates between fast
estimation of lower and upper bounds, graph reductions, and heuristic coloring.
We evaluate RECOL on a wide range of benchmark datasets, including SNAP, the
Network Repository, DIMACS10, and DIMACS2. Experimental results show that RECOL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on very large sparse
graphs within one minute. Additional experiments further highlight the pivotal
role of reduction techniques in achieving this performance.

TL;DR: 结合Alias方法和系统抽样概念，提出一种高效的离散分布采样方法，比传统方法快一个数量级，适用于粒子滤波器等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决离散分布采样效率低的问题，特别是在粒子滤波器中需要高效低方差重采样时，传统方法如二分查找或反演方法速度较慢。

Method: 将Alias方法与系统抽样相结合，系统抽样是粒子滤波中常用的低方差重采样方法，新方法显著提升了采样速度。

Result: 采样k个样本比传统方法快一个数量级，经验分布函数评估显示该方法与多项式抽样相比表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为生成粒子滤波器建议分布随机样本的通用高效方式，如机器人运动模型等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we combine the Alias method with the concept of systematic
sampling, a method commonly used in particle filters for efficient low-variance
resampling. The proposed method allows very fast sampling from a discrete
distribution: drawing k samples is up to an order of magnitude faster than
binary search from the cumulative distribution function (cdf) or inversion
methods used in many libraries. The produced empirical distribution function is
evaluated using a modified Cram\'er-Von Mises goodness-of-fit statistic,
showing that the method compares very favourably to multinomial sampling. As
continuous distributions can often be approximated with discrete ones, the
proposed method can be used as a very general way to efficiently produce random
samples for particle filter proposal distributions, e.g. for motion models in
robotics.

Method: 通过系统性地改变三个关键参数（承诺机制、观察成本、顺序选择），分析先知不等式和潘多拉魔盒之间的所有可能变体，总结已知结果并填补研究空白。

Conclusion: 承诺机制、观察成本和顺序选择这三个参数共同定义了最优停止问题的完整变体空间，揭示了不同问题之间的深层联系，为理解在线决策提供了统一框架。

Abstract: We investigate the role of commitment in optimal stopping by studying all the
variants between Prophet Inequality (PI) and Pandora's Box (PB). Both problems
deal with a set of variables drawn from known distributions.
  In PI the gambler observes an adversarial order of these variables with the
goal of selecting one that maximizes the expected value against a prophet who
knows the exact values realized. The gambler has to irrevocably decide at each
step whether to select the value or discard it (commitment).
  On the other hand, in PB the gambler selects the order of inspecting the
variables and for each pays an observation cost to see the actual value
realized, aiming to choose one to maximize the net cost of the value chosen
minus the observation cost paid. The gambler in PB can return and select any
variable already seen (no commitment).
  For all the variants between these problems that arise by changing parameters
such as (1) commitment (2) observation cost (3) order selection, we concisely
summarize the known results and fill the gaps of variants not yet studied. We
also uncover connections to Ski-Rental, a classic online algorithm problem.

numbers in the unit interval from increasing probability density functions. We
focus on the problem of sampling from $n$ correlated random variables from a
joint distribution whose marginal distributions are all increasing. We show
that, in the worst case, the expected number of random bits required to accept
or reject a sample grows at least linearly and at most quadratically with $n$.

Abstract: A forcing set $S$ in a combinatorial problem is a set of elements such that
there is a unique solution that contains all the elements in $S$. An
anti-forcing set is the symmetric concept: a set $S$ of elements is called an
anti-forcing set if there is a unique solution disjoint from $S$. There are
extensive studies on the computational complexity of finding a minimum forcing
set in various combinatorial problems, and the known results indicate that many
problems would be harder than their classical counterparts: finding a minimum
forcing set for perfect matchings is NP-hard [Adams et al., Discret. Math.
2004] and finding a minimum forcing set for satisfying assignments for 3CNF
formulas is $\mathrm{\Sigma}_2^P$-hard [Hatami-Maserrat, DAM 2005]. In this
paper, we investigate the complexity of the problems of finding minimum forcing
and anti-forcing sets for the shortest $s$-$t$ path problem and the minimum
weight spanning tree problem. We show that, unlike the aforementioned results,
these problems are tractable, with the exception of finding a minimum
anti-forcing set for shortest $s$-$t$ paths, which is NP-hard.

Motivation: 传统归并排序需要额外数组空间，这在处理大数据时可能不切实际。现有原地归并排序算法要么效率低下，要么不稳定，要么过于复杂，缺乏实用的解决方案。

Method: 基于两个基础组件：最优数组旋转和2014年提出的共排名思想（最初用于并行化归并排序），设计了一种稳定的原地归并排序算法。

Result: 算法在理论上使用最优的O(n log n)比较次数，在实践中具有低常数因子，在目前最大的共享内存系统上实现了良好的性能。

Conclusion: 该算法提供了一种稳定、高效且易于理解的原地归并排序解决方案，虽然时间复杂度不是最优的O(n log n)，但在实际应用中表现良好。

Abstract: Mergesort is one of the few efficient sorting algorithms and, despite being
the oldest one, often still the method of choice today. In contrast to some
alternative algorithms, it always runs efficiently using O(n log n) element
comparisons and usually works in a stable manner. Its only practical
disadvantage is the need for a second array, and thus twice the amount of
memory. This can be an impeding factor, especially when handling large amounts
of data, where it is often either impractical or even impossible to fall back
to slower or unstable sorting alternatives. Therefore, many attempts have been
made to fix this problem by adapting Mergesort to work in place. While it is
known that such algorithms exist, the previously published solutions are mostly
not efficient, become unstable, and/or are very complex. This renders them
practically useless for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a
novel in-place Mergesort algorithm that is stable by design. Albeit its running
time of O(n log^2 n) is not quite optimal, it still works efficiently, both in
theory using the optimal number of O(n log n) comparisons and in practice with
low constants, while being easily comprehensible. The baseline for this new
algorithm includes just two prerequisites: 1) an optimal array rotation; and 2)
the co-ranking idea, published in 2014 and originally intended to parallelize
Mergesort. Although it would certainly be possible to parallelize the presented
algorithm, this paper focuses on the sequential aspect of this efficient,
stable and in-place Mergesort algorithm. Additionally, we implemented our
algorithm and present performance results measured on one of the largest shared
memory systems currently available.

Abstract: This paper significantly strengthens directed low-diameter decompositions in
several ways.
  We define and give the first results for separated low-diameter
decompositions in directed graphs, tighten and generalize probabilistic
guarantees, and prove new independence results between (far away) edges. Our
results are the first to give meaningful guarantees for decompositions with
small diameters $D = \Omega(\log\log n)$ in contrast to the state of the art
that only applies to super-logarithmic diameters $D = \omega(\log n)$.
  These results transfer several important and widely used aspects of
undirected low-diameter decompositions to the directed setting. All our results
are algorithmic -- small modifications to two existing directed low-diameter
decompositions [Bri+25; Li25] can be used to sample decompositions with our new
guarantees in near-linear time $\tilde{O}(m)$.

  It turns out that almost any neural network accumulates computational

Abstract: Sparse embeddings of data form an attractive class due to their inherent
interpretability: Every dimension is tied to a term in some vocabulary, making
it easy to visually decipher the latent space. Sparsity, however, poses unique
challenges for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) which finds, from a
collection of vectors, the k vectors closest to a query. To encourage research
on this underexplored topic, sparse ANNS featured prominently in a BigANN
Challenge at NeurIPS 2023, where approximate algorithms were evaluated on large
benchmark datasets by throughput and accuracy. In this work, we introduce a set
of novel data structures and algorithmic methods, a combination of which leads
to an elegant, effective, and highly efficient solution to sparse ANNS. Our
contributions range from a theoretically-grounded sketching algorithm for
sparse vectors to reduce their effective dimensionality while preserving inner
product-induced ranks; a geometric organization of the inverted index; and the
blending of local and global information to improve the efficiency and efficacy
of ANNS. Empirically, our final algorithm, dubbed Seismic, reaches
sub-millisecond per-query latency with high accuracy on a large-scale benchmark
dataset using a single CPU.
