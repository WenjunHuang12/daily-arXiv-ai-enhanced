Existing scheduling\npolicies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,\nthat overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'\nlong-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several\npsychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).\n  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on\nthree key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and\noperant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on\nthe mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a\nsimple linear search given the above algorithm.

We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves\ndeterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the\nbackbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global\nFrame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame\nDiffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from\nadditional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which\nrelies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,\nwe further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.\n  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nwith a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,\nalongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These\nresults surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and\nuniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study\nestablishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically\ngrounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of\nglobal structure preservation."}

To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured\nAttention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of\nsubgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial\ncorrelation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph\nrepresentations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph\nAttention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.\nBuilding on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting\nmodel by progressively expanding subgraph scales.

In this paper, we use clinical\ncontext, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic\nevaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR\ndiagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a\n``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for\nexisting contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.\nUsing this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several\ndiagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test\nprobability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether\nstrong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an\nability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that\nperformance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not\nexist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives\nfrom inferring this clinical context.

While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven\nprogress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:\nhuman-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora\nare often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales\ninto prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we\npresent PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted\nheuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are\niteratively refined to guide prompt construction.

These results are consistent with measurements using\nproduction-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and\nassumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling\nscenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x\nto 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver\nthe largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the\nmodel, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median\nreductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can\nplausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we\nestimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion\nqueries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8\nGWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,\nsimilar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how\ndata centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains\nduring the internet and cloud build-up."}

We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and\ntrajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect\nlearning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal\nthree key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial\ninteraction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate\ntrajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;\nand (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,\nopen-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and\ntransferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of\nreward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and\nestablish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric\nagentic models. All codes and data are public for future research."}

This thesis investigates the\nimpact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set\nto explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code\nmetrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and\nhigh-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five\ndatasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both\nuser and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented\nwith algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically\nsignificant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline\n(0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not\nlead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user\nfeatures (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did\nimprove its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by\nleading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user\nalgorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user\nfeatures is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection\nprecision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a\nnon-trivial challenge."}

Each of these\ngames is modeled as a Tug-of-War (ToW) game where increasing the action of one\nplayer decreases the reward for all other players. Each player participates in\nonly one game at any given time. At each time step, a player decides the game\nin which they wish to participate in and the action they take in that game.\nTheir reward depends on the actions of all players that are in the same game.\nThis system of K games is termed `Meta Tug-of-War' (Meta-ToW) game. These games\ncan model scenarios such as power control, distributed task allocation, and\nactivation in sensor networks. We propose the Meta Tug-of-Peace algorithm, a\ndistributed algorithm where the action updates are done using a simple\nstochastic approximation algorithm, and the decision to switch games is made\nusing an infrequent 1-bit communication between the players. We prove that in\nMeta-ToW games, our algorithm converges to an equilibrium that satisfies a\ntarget Quality of Service reward vector for the players. We then demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our algorithm through simulations for the scenarios mentioned\nabove."}

Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation\nenvironments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on\nsimplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that\ndo not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change\nprediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the\npractical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often\nunder-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction\nthrough a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights\nthat emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical\nchallenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational\nconstraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these\nexperiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar\npipelines."}

Existing scheduling\npolicies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps,\nthat overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users'\nlong-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several\npsychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022).\n  In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on\nthree key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and\noperant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave\nfunction of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is\nmodeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user\ninterest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask\nthe following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads\nshould be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the\nads?\n  Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of\ndisplayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the\noperant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm\nthat outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the\nperformance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small.\nOur algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and\nshows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many\nnatural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on\nthe mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a\nsimple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings\nwith experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various\nbaselines."}
