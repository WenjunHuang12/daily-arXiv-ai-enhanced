Music understanding requires grounded reasoning over symbolic scores and expressive performance audio, which general-purpose MLLMs often fail to handle due to insufficient perceptual grounding. We introduce MuseAgent, a music-centric multimodal agent that augments language models with structured symbolic representations derived from sheet music images and performance audio. By integrating optical music recognition and automatic music transcription modules, MuseAgent enables multi-step reasoning and interaction over fine-grained musical content. To systematically evaluate music understanding capabilities, we further propose MuseBench, a benchmark covering music theory reasoning, score interpretation, and performance-level analysis across text, image, and audio modalities. Experiments show that existing MLLMs perform poorly on these tasks, while MuseAgent achieves substantial improvements, highlighting the importance of structured multimodal grounding for interactive music understanding."}

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss.

The method is demonstrated by computing $C(n)$ for $n = 2,050,572,903$ yielding a result with a targeted $1,234,567,890$ decimal digits. To circumvent the memory limitations associated with evaluating large factorials, the algorithm operates exclusively in the prime-exponent domain. Phase 1 employs a parallel segmented sieve to enumerate primes up to $2n$ and applies Legendre's formula to determine the precise prime factorization of $C(n)$. The primes are grouped by exponent and serialized to disk. Phase 2 reconstructs the final integer using a memory-efficient balanced product tree with chunking. The algorithm runs on a time complexity of $Θ(n(\\log n)^2)$ bit-operations and a space complexity of $Θ(n \\log n)$ bits. This result represents the largest exact Catalan number computed to date. Performance statistics for a single-machine execution are reported, and verification strategies -- including modular checks and SHA-256 hash validation -- are discussed.

Their structural differences, continual evolution, and limited cross-resource alignment require substantial manual integration, limiting the depth and scale of knowledge exploration. We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis. These results highlight the potential of knowledge-graph-driven Deep Research to accelerate biomedical discovery."}

In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \\rightarrow -\\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \\in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \\leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p > 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \\leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $Σ_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items."}

We present a systematic study of metadata-aware retrieval strategies, comparing plain-text baselines with approaches that embed metadata directly. Our evaluation spans metadata-as-text (prefix and suffix), a dual-encoder unified embedding that fuses metadata and content in a single index, dual-encoder late-fusion retrieval, and metadata-aware query reformulation. Across multiple retrieval metrics and question types, we find that prefixing and unified embeddings consistently outperform plain-text baselines, with the unified at times exceeding prefixing while being easier to maintain. Beyond empirical comparisons, we analyze embedding space, showing that metadata integration improves effectiveness by increasing intra-document cohesion, reducing inter-document confusion, and widening the separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks. Field-level ablations show that structural cues provide strong disambiguating signals. Our code, evaluation framework, and the RAGMATE-10K dataset are publicly hosted."}

As relQuery services become more widely adopted in applications such as AI-powered spreadsheets, fast response times under concurrent query loads are increasingly important. Unfortunately, current LLM engines face severe latency bottlenecks from Head-of-Line (HoL) blocking across three comparable inference phases: waiting, core running, and tail running. Existing static priority scheduling methods only address HoL blocking during the waiting phase, leaving two critical problems unsolved. First, the absence of a priority update mechanism causes inaccurate prioritization and continued HoL blocking during core execution. Second, suboptimal prefill-decode batching exacerbates HoL blocking in tail execution and worsens latency trade-offs between running and waiting relQueries. To address these problems, we propose RelServe, an optimized LLM engine for low-latency relQuery serving. RelServe features two core innovations: a Dynamic Priority Updater that continuously adjusts priorities while minimizing overhead via statistical approximations, and an Adaptive Batch Arranger that quantitatively evaluates candidate prefill and decode batches to minimize projected average latency. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets using LLMs ranging from 13B to 70B parameters show that RelServe reduces average serving latency by up to 3.1x compared to vLLM."}

In this work, we are interested in understanding the gamut of options left for the \"losing\" party, and so we consider the flip side of the problem: Given fixed/predetermined districts, can a given party still make their candidates win by strategically placing them in certain districts?

Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups.

However, two central questions remained open: does there always exist an allocation that is envy-free up to one item (EF1), and if not, what is the optimal relaxation EF-$k$ that can always be attained?\n  We settle both questions by deriving tight asymptotic bounds on the number of items sufficient to eliminate envy. We show that for any instance with $n$ agents, an allocation that is envy-free up to $O(\\sqrt{n})$ items always exists and can be found in polynomial time, and we prove a matching $Ω(\\sqrt{n})$ lower bound showing that this result is tight even for binary valuations, which rules out the existence of EF1 allocations when agents have externalities."}

For this, a strong theoretical foundation has to be established. We contribute to this by rigorously analyzing a Random Local Search (RLS) algorithm that aims to find a minimum dominating set on a graph. We consider its performance on cycle graphs with $n$ vertices. We prove an upper bound for the expected runtime until an optimum is found of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^4\\log^2(n)\\right)$. In doing so, we introduce several models to represent dominating sets on cycles that help us understand how RLS explores the search space to find an optimum.

In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent.

In this paper, we propose a general information-theoretic framework for causal order estimation that remains applicable under arbitrary confounding. Rather than imposing independence as a hard constraint, we quantify the degree of confounding by the multivariate mutual information among the noise variables. This quantity is decomposed into a sum of mutual information terms along a causal order and is estimated using Bayesian marginal likelihoods. The resulting criterion can be interpreted as Bayesian ICA for causal discovery, where causal order selection is formulated as a model selection problem over permutations. Under standard regularity conditions, we show that the proposed Bayesian mutual information estimator is consistent, with redundancy of order $O(\\log n)$. To avoid non-identifiability caused by Gaussian noise, we employ non-Gaussian predictive models, including multivariate $t$ distributions, whose marginal likelihoods can be evaluated via MCMC. The proposed method recovers classical LiNGAM and DirectLiNGAM as limiting cases in the absence of confounding, while providing a principled ranking of causal orders when confounding is present. This establishes a unified, confounding-aware, and information-theoretically grounded extension of ICA-based causal discovery."}

This paper analyzes the architectural limitations of the dominant \"HNSW + float32 + cosine similarity\" stack and evaluates existing cost-reduction strategies, including storage disaggregation and lossy vector quantization, which inevitably sacrifice either performance or accuracy. We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates. We show that this architectural shift enables a truly serverless, cost-per-query deployment model, challenging the necessity of large in-memory ANN indexes for high-quality semantic search."}

However, the true accuracy of these regret estimates remains unclear. Computing exact regret is computationally intractable, and current models rely on gradient based optimizers whose outcomes depend heavily on hyperparameter choices. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation. Building on this, we propose a guided refinement procedure that substantially improves regret estimation accuracy while reducing computational cost. Our method provides a more reliable foundation for evaluating incentive compatibility in deep learning based auction mechanisms and highlights the need to reassess prior performance claims in this area."}

Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, adopting various models to combine these embeddings into a sequence representation that captures user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Furthermore, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films within the genre facet), which are challenging to fully represent with static identifiers. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture titled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the final multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately, effectively capturing distinct item facets. A gating mechanism then integrates these predictions by dynamically determining their importance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network within each attention head to disentangle varied user preferences within each facet, utilizing a learnable router network to aggregate expert outputs based on context. Complementing this architecture, we design a Text-Enhanced Facet-Aware Pre-training module to overcome the limitations of randomly initialized embeddings. By utilizing a pre-trained text encoder and employing an alternating supervised contrastive learning objective, we explicitly disentangle facet-specific features from textual metadata (e.g., descriptions) before sequential training begins. This ensures that the item embeddings are semantically robust and aligned with the downstream multi-facet framework."}

This transformation is analogous to the Neolithic Revolution, when societies shifted from hunting and gathering to cultivation. Generative technologies empower users to \"farm\" information by planting seeds in the form of prompts, cultivating workflows over time, and harvesting richly structured, relevant yields within their own plots, rather than foraging across others people's patches. In this perspectives paper, we introduce the notion of Information Farming as a conceptual framework and argue that it represents a natural evolution in how people engage with information. Drawing on historical analogy and empirical evidence, we examine the benefits and opportunities of information farming, its implications for design and evaluation, and the accompanying risks posed by this transition. We hypothesize that as GenAI technologies proliferate, cultivating information will increasingly supplant transient, patch-based foraging as a dominant mode of engagement, marking a broader shift in human-information interaction and its study."}

While the GPU-accelerated Inverted File (IVF) index acts as one of the most widely used techniques for these large-scale workloads due to its memory efficiency, its traditional architecture remains fundamentally static. Existing designs rely on rigid and contiguous memory layouts that lack native support for in-place mutation, creating a severe bottleneck for streaming scenarios. In applications requiring real-time knowledge updates, such as live recommendation engines or dynamic RAG systems, maintaining index freshness necessitates expensive CPU-GPU roundtrips that cause system latency to spike from milliseconds to seconds. In this paper, we propose SIVF (Streaming Inverted File), a new GPU-native architecture designed to empower vector databases with high-velocity data ingestion and deletion capabilities. SIVF replaces the static memory layout with a slab-based allocation system and a validity bitmap, enabling lock-free and in-place mutation directly in VRAM. We further introduce a GPU-resident address translation table (ATT) to resolve the overhead of locating vectors, providing $O(1)$ access to physical storage slots. We evaluate SIVF against the industry-standard GPU IVF implementation on the SIFT1M and GIST1M datasets. Microbenchmarks demonstrate that SIVF reduces deletion latency by up to $13,300\\times$ (from 11.8 seconds to 0.89 ms on GIST1M) and improves ingestion throughput by $36\\times$ to $105\\times$. In end-to-end sliding window scenarios, SIVF eliminates system freezes and achieves a $161\\times$ to $266\\times$ speedup with single-digit millisecond latency.

Traditional dynamic pricing models, often relying on deterministic EV-CS pairings and network equilibrium assumptions, frequently oversimplify user behavior and lack scalability. This study proposes a stochastic, behaviorally heterogeneous dynamic pricing framework formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The upper level optimizes time-varying pricing to maximize system-wide utility, while the lower level models decentralized EV users via a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model incorporating price sensitivity, battery aging, risk attitudes, and network travel costs. Crucially, the model avoids network equilibrium constraints to enhance scalability, with congestion effects represented via queuing-theoretic approximations. To efficiently solve the resulting large-scale optimization problem, a rolling-horizon approach combining the Dynamic Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis-guided Cross-Entropy Method (PSA-CEM) with the Method of Successive Averages (MSA) is implemented. A real-world case study in Clayton, Melbourne, validates the framework using 22 charging stations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism substantially reduces queuing penalties and improves user utility compared to fixed and time-of-use pricing. The framework provides a robust, scalable tool for strategic EV charging management, balancing realism with computational efficiency."}

In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process. The second algorithm utilizes the construction of the base model and computes the same values in polynomial time with respect to $n$ under the uniform drawing distribution, and the third algorithm extends to any general drawing distribution. All algorithms leverage Markov models specifically designed to address computational challenges, ensuring exact computation of the expectation and variance of the collection process.

However, most existing architectures employ a decoupled pipeline: long sequences are first compressed with a query-token based sequence compressor like LONGER, followed by fusion with dense features through token-mixing modules like RankMixer, which thereby limits both the representation capacity and the interaction flexibility. This paper presents HyFormer, a unified hybrid transformer architecture that tightly integrates long-sequence modeling and feature interaction into a single backbone. From the perspective of sequence modeling, we revisit and redesign query tokens in LRMs, and frame the LRM modeling task as an alternating optimization process that integrates two core components: Query Decoding which expands non-sequential features into Global Tokens and performs long sequence decoding over layer-wise key-value representations of long behavioral sequences; and Query Boosting which enhances cross-query and cross-sequence heterogeneous interactions via efficient token mixing. The two complementary mechanisms are performed iteratively to refine semantic representations across layers. Extensive experiments on billion-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that HyFormer consistently outperforms strong LONGER and RankMixer baselines under comparable parameter and FLOPs budgets, while exhibiting superior scaling behavior with increasing parameters and FLOPs. Large-scale online A/B tests in high-traffic production systems further validate its effectiveness, showing significant gains over deployed state-of-the-art models.

It can escape local optima by tunneling through energy barriers rather than climbing over them. Earlier works mainly focused on providing an abstract representation (e.g., Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)) for the database optimization problems (e.g., join order) and overlooked the real integration within database systems due to the high overhead of quantum computing services (e.g., a minimum 5s runtime for D-Wave's CQM-Solver).

Both arise from input data, propagate through recommendation models, and lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes. Popularity bias occurs when a small subset of items receives most interactions, while positivity bias stems from the over-representation of high rating values. Although each bias has been studied independently, their combined effect, to which we refer to as multifactorial bias, remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how multifactorial bias influences item-side fairness, focusing on exposure bias, which reflects the unequal visibility of items in recommendation outputs. Through simulation studies, we find that positivity bias is disproportionately concentrated on popular items, further amplifying their over-exposure. Motivated by this insight, we adapt a percentile-based rating transformation as a pre-processing strategy to mitigate multifactorial bias. Experiments using six recommendation algorithms across four public datasets show that this approach improves exposure fairness with negligible accuracy loss. We also demonstrate that integrating this pre-processing step into post-processing fairness pipelines enhances their effectiveness and efficiency, enabling comparable or better fairness with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multifactorial bias and demonstrate the practical value of simple, data-driven pre-processing methods for improving fairness in recommender systems."}

It has been used for various tasks such as retrieving similar items in high-dimensional images or text data. In retrieval applications, however, the Wasserstein distance is calculated repeatedly, and its cubic time complexity with respect to input size renders it unsuitable for large-scale datasets. Recently, tree-based approximation methods have been proposed to address this bottleneck. For example, the Flowtree algorithm computes transport on a quadtree and evaluates cost using the ground metric, and clustering-tree approaches have been reported to achieve high accuracy. However, these existing trees often incur significant construction time for preprocessing, and crucially, standard quadtrees cannot grow deep enough in high-dimensional spaces, resulting in poor approximation accuracy. In this paper, we propose kd-Flowtree, a kd-tree-based Wasserstein distance approximation method that uses a kd-tree for data embedding. Since kd-trees can grow sufficiently deep and adaptively even in high-dimensional cases, kd-Flowtree is capable of maintaining good approximation accuracy for such cases. In addition, kd-trees can be constructed quickly than quadtrees, which contributes to reducing the computation time required for nearest neighbor search, including preprocessing. We provide a probabilistic upper bound on the nearest-neighbor search accuracy of kd-Flowtree, and show that this bound is independent of the dataset size. In the numerical experiments, we demonstrated that kd-Flowtree outperformed the existing Wasserstein distance approximation methods for retrieval tasks with real-world data."}

At the same time, current LLMs still struggle to fully interpret complex and multifaceted tasks. To address this gap, we argue for a stronger task-based perspective on query intent. Drawing on a grounded-theory-based interview study with airport information clerks, we present a taxonomy of task-based information request intents that bridges the gap between traditional query-focused approaches and the emerging demands of AI-driven task-oriented search."}

Moreover, we characterize the achievable computation rate and show that the proposed hierarchical constellations can compute R output functions with decoding error probability epsilon while the gap to the optimal computation rate scales as O(\\log_2(1/ε)/K) for independent source symbols, where K denotes the number of transmitters. Consequently, this gap vanishes as the network size grows, and the optimal rate is asymptotically attained.\n  Furthermore, we introduce a shielding mechanism based on variable-length block coding that mitigates noise-induced error propagation across constellation levels while preserving the superposition structure of the MAC. We show that the shielding technique improves reliability, yielding a gap that scales optimally as O(\\log_2\\ln{(1/ε)}), regardless of the source distribution.

Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.\n  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem."}

When stability cannot be achieved, algorithmicists and market designers face a critical question: how should instability be measured and distributed among participants? Existing approaches to \"almost-stable\" matchings focus on aggregate measures, minimising either the total number of blocking pairs or the count of agents involved in blocking pairs. However, such aggregate objectives can result in concentrated instability on a few individual agents, raising concerns about fairness and incentives to deviate. We introduce a fairness-oriented approach to approximate stability based on the minimax principle: we seek matchings that minimise the maximum number of blocking pairs any agent is in. Equivalently, we minimise the maximum number of agents that anyone has justified envy towards. This distributional objective protects the worst-off agents from a disproportionate amount of instability. We characterise the computational complexity of this notion across fundamental matching settings. Surprisingly, even very modest guarantees prove computationally intractable: we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists in which no agent is in more than one blocking pair, even when preference lists have constant-bounded length. This hardness applies to both Stable Roommates and maximum-cardinality Stable Marriage. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms when agents rank at most two others, and present approximation algorithms and integer programs. Our results map the algorithmic landscape and reveal fundamental trade-offs between distributional guarantees and computational feasibility."}

In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress."}

At each round of the game, the fugitive moves from one vertex to an adjacent vertex. Then the Nemesis deletes one edge anywhere in the graph. The game ends when either the fugitive reached an exit or when he is in a connected component that does not contain any exit.

To more accurately infer user preferences from multi-turn conversations, recent works increasingly expand conversational context (e.g., by incorporating diverse entity information or retrieving related dialogues). While such context enrichment can assist preference modeling, it also introduces longer and more heterogeneous inputs, leading to practical issues such as input length constraints, text style inconsistency, and irrelevant textual noise, thereby raising the demand for stronger language understanding ability. In this paper, we propose STARCRS, a Screen-Text-AwaRe Conversational Recommender System that integrates two complementary text understanding modes: (1) a screen-reading pathway that encodes auxiliary textual information as visual tokens, mimicking skim reading on a screen, and (2) an LLM-based textual pathway that focuses on a limited set of critical content for fine-grained reasoning. We design a knowledge-anchored fusion framework that combines contrastive alignment, cross-attention interaction, and adaptive gating to integrate the two modes for improved preference modeling and response generation. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that STARCRS consistently improves both recommendation accuracy and generated response quality."}

When stability cannot be achieved, algorithmicists and market designers face a critical question: how should instability be measured and distributed among participants? Existing approaches to \"almost-stable\" matchings focus on aggregate measures, minimising either the total number of blocking pairs or the count of agents involved in blocking pairs. However, such aggregate objectives can result in concentrated instability on a few individual agents, raising concerns about fairness and incentives to deviate. We introduce a fairness-oriented approach to approximate stability based on the minimax principle: we seek matchings that minimise the maximum number of blocking pairs any agent is in. Equivalently, we minimise the maximum number of agents that anyone has justified envy towards. This distributional objective protects the worst-off agents from a disproportionate amount of instability. We characterise the computational complexity of this notion across fundamental matching settings. Surprisingly, even very modest guarantees prove computationally intractable: we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a matching exists in which no agent is in more than one blocking pair, even when preference lists have constant-bounded length. This hardness applies to both Stable Roommates and maximum-cardinality Stable Marriage. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms when agents rank at most two others, and present approximation algorithms and integer programs. Our results map the algorithmic landscape and reveal fundamental trade-offs between distributional guarantees and computational feasibility."}

For the success of these platforms, it is crucial to design reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that not only increase the total number of matches but also avoid creating unfairness among users. In this paper, we investigate the fairness of RRSs on matching platforms. From the perspective of fair division, we define the users' opportunities to be recommended and establish the fairness concept of envy-freeness in the allocation of these opportunities. We first introduce the Social Welfare (SW) method, which approximately maximizes the number of matches, and show that it leads to significant unfairness in recommendation opportunities, illustrating the trade-off between fairness and match rates. To address this challenge, we propose the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) method, which alternately optimizes two NSW functions and achieves nearly envy-free recommendations. We further generalize the SW and NSW method to the $α$-SW method, which balances the trade-off between fairness and high match rates. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient approximation algorithm for the SW/NSW/$α$-SW methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach."}

Focusing on binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, differential privacy (DP) is first studied under a deterministic phase rotation applied on the BPSK modulation at the transmitter, while the receiver is assumed to be unaware of the rotation angle. In this setting, privacy is achieved through an effective reduction in the decision distance, resulting in a controlled increase in the bit error rate (BER) without explicit noise injection. Next, a BPSK transmission scheme with intentionally induced inter-symbol interference (ISI) is studied, where the receiver is likewise unaware of the deterministic timing offset that generates the ISI. Unlike the rotated BPSK scheme, the DP obtained via ISI is shown to depend explicitly on the input data distribution. In particular, numerical results demonstrate that, for a fixed ISI parameter, the privacy loss is maximized when the binary input symbols are equiprobable. While conventional DP mechanisms rely on artificially added noise, often incurring additional energy or communication costs, it is shown that structured modifications, such as modulation rotation or induced ISI inherent to realistic communication channels can itself provide DP guarantees. While the analysis focuses on deterministic transmitter modifications unknown to the receiver, it is noted that real-world devices naturally introduce unintentional rotations or ISI due to hardware nonidealities and implementation errors. These effects can therefore provide a level of privacy without requiring explicit noise injection. Hence, it is possible to avoid deliberately perturbing the data, instead leveraging inherent device imperfections to achieve privacy guarantees with no additional privacy cost."}

Can training on combined EEG datasets from different sensory modalities improve performance despite severe data scarcity? We present the first systematic investigation of auditory EEG for BPR and evaluate cross-sensory training benefits. Using dual encoder architectures with four pooling strategies (CLS, mean, max, multi-vector), we conduct controlled experiments comparing auditory-only, visual-only, and combined training on the Alice (auditory) and Nieuwland (visual) datasets.

Critically, combined auditory EEG models surpass BM25 text baselines (MRR: 0.474 vs 0.428), establishing neural queries as competitive with traditional retrieval whilst enabling accessible interfaces.

Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space.\n  We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c>0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution.\n  As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent \"modular energy\"; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics."}

Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) exemplifies this shift as each query combines a reference image with textual modifications, requiring compositional understanding across modalities.

To address these limitations, we introduce XR, a training-free multi-agent framework that reframes retrieval as a progressively coordinated reasoning process. It orchestrates three specialized types of agents: imagination agents synthesize target representations through cross-modal generation, similarity agents perform coarse filtering via hybrid matching, and question agents verify factual consistency through targeted reasoning for fine filtering.

This raises a natural and fundamental question: are the monotone submodular functions most commonly used in practice entropic?\n  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative for a broad class of widely used polymatroid functions. We provide explicit entropic constructions for set cover and coverage functions, facility location, saturated coverage, concave-over-modular functions via truncations, and monotone graph-cut-type objectives. Our results show that these functions can be realized exactly as Shannon entropies of appropriately constructed random variables. As a consequence, for these functions, submodular mutual information coincides with classical mutual information, conditional gain specializes to conditional entropy, and submodular conditional mutual information reduces to standard conditional mutual information in the entropic sense.

Second, we introduce a new class of decodable rank-metric codes, namely Extended Gabidulin-Kronecker product (EGK) codes, which generalize the structure of Gabidulin-Kronecker product (GK) codes. We also propose a decoding algorithm that directly retrieves the codeword without recovering the error vector, thus improving efficiency. This algorithm achieves zero decoding failure probability when the error weight is within its correction capability. Third, we propose three enhanced variants of the RQC cryptosystem based on EGK codes, each offering a distinct trade-off between security and efficiency. For 128-bit security, all variants achieve significant reductions in public key size compared to the Multi-UR-AG (Bidoux et.al., IEEE IT, 2024) while ensuring zero decryption failure probability--a key security advantage over many existing rank-based schemes."}

While the GPU-accelerated Inverted File (IVF) index acts as one of the most widely used techniques for these large-scale workloads due to its memory efficiency, its traditional architecture remains fundamentally static. Existing designs rely on rigid and contiguous memory layouts that lack native support for in-place mutation, creating a severe bottleneck for streaming scenarios. In applications requiring real-time knowledge updates, such as live recommendation engines or dynamic RAG systems, maintaining index freshness necessitates expensive CPU-GPU roundtrips that cause system latency to spike from milliseconds to seconds. In this paper, we propose SIVF (Streaming Inverted File), a new GPU-native architecture designed to empower vector databases with high-velocity data ingestion and deletion capabilities. SIVF replaces the static memory layout with a slab-based allocation system and a validity bitmap, enabling lock-free and in-place mutation directly in VRAM. We further introduce a GPU-resident address translation table (ATT) to resolve the overhead of locating vectors, providing $O(1)$ access to physical storage slots. We evaluate SIVF against the industry-standard GPU IVF implementation on the SIFT1M and GIST1M datasets. Microbenchmarks demonstrate that SIVF reduces deletion latency by up to $13,300\\times$ (from 11.8 seconds to 0.89 ms on GIST1M) and improves ingestion throughput by $36\\times$ to $105\\times$. In end-to-end sliding window scenarios, SIVF eliminates system freezes and achieves a $161\\times$ to $266\\times$ speedup with single-digit millisecond latency. Notably, this performance incurs negligible storage penalty, maintaining less than 0.8\\% memory overhead compared to static indices."}

However, relying on generic distortion metrics fails to capture complex human visual perception, often resulting in blurred or unrealistic reconstructions. In this paper, we propose Joint Source-Channel-Generation Coding (JSCGC), a novel paradigm that shifts the focus from deterministic reconstruction to probabilistic generation. JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods."}

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

The mechanical adjustment provides wide-angle coverage but suffers from slow response, while the electronic tuning enables rapid beam reconfiguration but with limited angular range. To effectively combine their complementary advantages, we propose to jointly design both mechanical and electronic configurations to maximize the average sum-rate of users via a two-timescale optimization approach, in which the array positions are optimized on the long timescale according to large-scale user distribution statistics, and the pattern selection vectors are optimized on the short timescale to enable fast beam alignment based on the instantaneous user locations. An alternating optimization algorithm based on the Monte Carlo sampling method is developed to solve the problem efficiently.

We assume that the instantaneous knowledge of the transmit signal at the sensing receiver is not available, and the sensing receiver only has knowledge of the statistical properties of the received signal. Unlike prior research that focuses on power allocation or optimal beamforming design for ISAC, we emphasize the inadequacy of the Cramér-Rao Bound (and its variant) in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, particularly in passive sensing scenarios. Due to severe path loss and other impairments, the received sensing SNR is often significantly lower than that of direct Line-of-Sight communication, making CRB-based performance evaluation unreliable. To address this, we adopt the Ziv-Zakai Bound (ZZB) for Angle of Arrival estimation, which provides a more meaningful lower bound on estimation error. We derive analytical expressions for the ZZB and the achievable ergodic communication rate as functions of SNR. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the pareto-front between communication and sensing performance, demonstrating why ZZB serves as a better metric in low sensing SNR ISAC where traditional CRB-based approaches fail."}

The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling.

Our analysis explicitly accounts for practical considerations such as channel fading, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead, and fairness-oriented power allocation.\n  Our contributions span both analytical and simulation-based fronts. On the analytical side, we derive analytical expressions for the achievable throughput under BD-MRC and ZF, highlighting the performance benefits of equipping multi-antenna users with cache-aided interference management. Specifically, we develop a low-complexity BD-MRC optimization method that leverages matrix structure to significantly reduce the dimensionality involved in precoding computation, followed by solving the associated maxmin fairness problem through an efficient one-dimensional search. In the massive MIMO regime, an asymptotic expression for the achievable throughput over Rayleigh fading channels is also derived. Simulations validate our theoretical results, confirming that VCC delivers substantial performance gains over optimized cacheless MU-MIMO systems. For example, with 32 transmit antennas and 2 receive antennas per user, VCC yields throughput improvements exceeding 300%.

Each such stabilizer identified allows us to freely fix a bit in its support without affecting the logical state of the decoded result. This removes one degree of freedom that would otherwise require a symbolic guess, reducing the number of inactivated variables and decreasing the size of the final linear system that must be solved. We further show that dual peeling combined with standard peeling alone, without inactivation, is sufficient to achieve ML for erasure decoding of surface codes.

If two distinct classes induce the same attribute profile, then the observation pi(V) is identical for both and no decoder can identify the class from attribute queries alone. Thus, if the profile map pi is not injective on classes, zero-error identification without tags is impossible (a zero-error feasibility threshold). Achievability and converse at D=0. With k classes, nominal tags of L = ceil(log2 k) bits enable O(1) identification cost with D=0. Conversely, any scheme with D=0 must satisfy L >= log2 k bits (tight). Without tags (L=0), identification requires Omega(n) queries in the worst case and may incur D>0. Combinatorial structure. Minimal sufficient query families form the bases of a matroid; the induced distinguishing dimension is well-defined and links to zero-error source coding via graph entropy. We illustrate implications for type systems, databases, and biological taxonomy. All results are mechanized in Lean4 (6000+ lines, 0 sorry)."}

This paper analyzes the architectural limitations of the dominant \"HNSW + float32 + cosine similarity\" stack and evaluates existing cost-reduction strategies, including storage disaggregation and lossy vector quantization, which inevitably sacrifice either performance or accuracy. We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates. We show that this architectural shift enables a truly serverless, cost-per-query deployment model, challenging the necessity of large in-memory ANN indexes for high-quality semantic search."}

Various generalizations of this problem have been applied in numerous engineering domains. However, practical applications are often hindered by the computational challenges associated with deriving numerical results for moments and distributions. In this work, we present three algorithms for solving the most general form of the CCP, where coupons are collected under any arbitrary drawing probability, with the objective of obtaining $t$ copies of a subset of $k$ coupons from a total of $n$. The First algorithm provides the base model to compute the expectation, variance, and the second moment of the collection process. The second algorithm utilizes the construction of the base model and computes the same values in polynomial time with respect to $n$ under the uniform drawing distribution, and the third algorithm extends to any general drawing distribution. All algorithms leverage Markov models specifically designed to address computational challenges, ensuring exact computation of the expectation and variance of the collection process. Their implementation uses a dynamic programming approach that follows from the Markov models framework, and their time complexity is analyzed accordingly."}

Cardinality estimation, a cornerstone of the optimizer, is critical for the selection of efficient query plans, as well as downstream tasks such as resource allocation and query scheduling. Yet, as many practitioners and researchers have noted, it is also the optimizer's Achilles heel. Prior studies on a number of industrial-strength databases show substantial cardinality estimation errors on all tested systems, with a far greater tendency to underestimate than to overestimate. Unfortunately, cardinality underestimation is more problematic than overestimation, as it misleads the optimizer to choose plans designed for small data, leading to underprovisioned CPU and memory.\n  While previous work on pessimistic cardinality estimation has proposed provable join size upper bounds, such methods can only correct overestimation, leaving the more harmful problem of underestimation unaddressed. To fill this critical gap, we introduce xBound, the very first framework for deriving provable join size lower bounds. xBound successfully reduces underestimation in real systems: On the JOBlight benchmark, it corrects 17.5% of subexpression underestimates in DuckDB and 8.7% in PostgreSQL, while on a Microsoft enterprise workload, it fixes 36.1% of Fabric Data Warehouse's underestimates, demonstrating a significant step towards solving this long-standing problem."}
